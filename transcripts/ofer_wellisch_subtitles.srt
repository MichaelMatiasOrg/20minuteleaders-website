1
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,400
Wonderful.

2
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,480
Ofer Wellisch, thank you

3
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,800
for being with me on 20 Minute Leaders.

4
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,040
How are you?

5
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,800
Good. Thanks for having me, Michael.

6
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,360
One of the things

7
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,360
that I said right before this

8
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,360
is I love the design of your home,

9
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,920
the light bulbs especially.

10
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,520
I think they're fantastic.

11
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,160
Really fabulous.

12
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,320
Well, I had nothing to do with it.

13
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,200
Sounds great.

14
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,400
Ofer, you're calling me from New York.

15
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,160
So, first of all, thank you

16
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,320
for taking the call so late.

17
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,000
I really appreciate it.

18
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,720
And your chief division of pain medicine

19
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,320
at Stamford Health, right?

20
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,840
But you were also

21
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,440
an attending physician at Stanford.

22
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,280
A limited partner at J- Ventures.

23
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,000
So, I'm really curious to hear about you.

24
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,560
You have one leg in medicine, as a doctor.

25
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,720
Another leg as an investor in MedTech.

26
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,240
And I'd love to allude eventually also

27
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,360
to what's happening today with covid

28
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,960
and how you're seeing this unfold

29
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,780
as we go along .

30
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,560
So, Ofer, take us on your journey.

31
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,160
I want to go back to Tel Aviv University.

32
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,440
Studying medicine, what is it like?

33
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,840
Do you know that you're going to be

34
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,400
passionate about pain medicine

35
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,120
throughout your life?

36
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,158
It's great questions there.

37
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:41,280
A lot of questions.

38
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,160
Yeah. So, actually,

39
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,680
when I was a master's student at GW

40
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,920
prior in medical school,

41
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,120
I'd done my thesis, my master's thesis

42
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,760
at the National Institutes of Health.

43
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,440
And I got in touch with the lab

44
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,500
that was studying molecular pain

45
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,800
and molecular neuroscience.

46
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,160
And this is a really great

47
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,320
growth opportunity for me.

48
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,640
The intramural program

49
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,320
in Bethesda Maryland for the NIH

50
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,480
is just a wonderful place

51
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,400
to just meet great mentors.

52
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,200
Get a lot of to your hands

53
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,280
on a lot of different

54
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,040
experimental techniques in medicine,

55
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,240
and just also meet a lot of personalities

56
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,840
that have been

57
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,520
very successful in medicine.

58
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,720
And so, from there,

59
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,920
I went on to medical school.

60
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,680
And I kept really good communication

61
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,960
with my mentors in the whole concept

62
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,200
of pain medicine and some of the concepts

63
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,360
we have been working on.

64
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,400
Wait. Ofer, what is pain medicine?

65
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,440
Just for background really quick,

66
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,120
what is pain medicine?

67
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,720
Right. So, we could talk a little bit

68
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,280
about chronic pain.

69
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,480
And pain medicine is essentially,

70
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,200
the practice of treating pain.

71
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,320
And evolutionarily, acute pain

72
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,160
has a purpose.

73
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,160
So, if a person back in the old times

74
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,520
injured themselves,

75
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,360
they go back to their cave

76
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,280
so the lion doesn't eat them, for example.

77
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,760
So, pain served a protective purpose.

78
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
Right?

79
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,400
Today, we have what's called chronic pain.

80
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,920
So, patients get injured.

81
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,240
Whether it's at work

82
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,800
or the sporting incident.

83
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,240
Their injuries actually heal,

84
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,160
yet they maintain, they still have

85
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,920
some level of chronic pain.

86
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,160
Now, chronic means a lifetime,

87
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,520
that this is a permanent pain

88
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,760
that you're going to experience

89
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,080
if not treated, right?

90
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,840
Or, that there is no treatment.

91
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,400
So, there are various

92
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,560
different treatments.

93
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,040
Chronic pain is defined as

94
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,720
three to six months or more.

95
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,320
So, with plasticity in the nervous system

96
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,960
and there's gene regulation and so forth

97
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,280
that occurs on the nerve level,

98
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,600
on the spinal cord level,

99
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,880
and also, on the brain level.

100
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,000
And so, we develop, emotional challenges

101
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,280
and economic challenges to chronic pain.

102
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,600
With chronic pain obviously,

103
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
in addition to debilitating pain

104
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,520
that we perceive, right?

105
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,960
So, yes. It is a longstanding disease.

106
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,420
Much like diabetes,

107
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,840
initially, we had thought

108
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,920
that it's a disturbance

109
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,280
with glucose management.

110
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,080
Glucose was perturbed.

111
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,840
And now, we learn that

112
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,760
there's a metabolic issue

113
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,520
that is much more widespread

114
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,400
with diabetes.

115
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,080
You get retinopathy, nephropathy,

116
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,320
your kidneys go, your eyes go,

117
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,840
you get obese.

118
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,200
And so, there are implications

119
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,240
that are much broader

120
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,640
than the initial insult,

121
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,600
which is the challenges

122
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
in glucose management.

123
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,120
Same with chronic pain.

124
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,520
You might have initial nerve injury,

125
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,840
yet that leads to a much broader issue

126
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,240
down the line with chronic pain.

127
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,200
And so, to treat chronic pain,

128
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,600
you really need to think about it

129
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,360
as a multipronged approach,

130
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,560
a comprehensive approach

131
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,480
to treat pharmacologically

132
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,040
various different targets

133
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,360
on different levels.

134
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,000
It sounds so complicated.

135
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,120
Ofer, it sounds like you have to study

136
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,480
for 20 years to just be able to understand

137
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,120
what you're saying here.

138
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,640
But, dumb it down for me.

139
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,520
Because, I'm coming in outside

140
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,560
of the medical arena.

141
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,640
I'm coming in as a young entrepreneur

142
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,760
and I'm trying to think,

143
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,960
how can we leverage  technology

144
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,360
in our day to day lives to improve

145
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,680
people's habits, people's lives.

146
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,280
Now, I build applications,

147
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,800
or I build algorithms that hopefully

148
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,840
will improve people's lives.

149
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,160
You're taking people's lives

150
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,920
that are suffering

151
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,720
and you're actually using medicine

152
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,880
to help them.

153
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,960
Very different from the work that I do.

154
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,640
So, help me understand

155
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,200
a little bit better.

156
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,760
What is the process that you go about

157
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,840
as the chief division of pain medicine,

158
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,240
what are your responsibilities

159
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,040
and what is this world of pain medicine?

160
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,360
How prevalent is it?

161
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,400
How big is it?

162
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,600
Is it really big deal?

163
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,160
Let me start with this.

164
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,200
So, it doesn't take one individual

165
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,040
to treat chronic pain.

166
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,120
It takes a team, right?

167
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,240
So, it takes perhaps a physician

168
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,160
to treat medically

169
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,240
with different medications.

170
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,840
It might take a procedure list

171
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,160
to do injections or use devices

172
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,880
that might be implantable and so forth.

173
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,280
It might take a physical therapist.

174
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,040
It might take a pain psychologist

175
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,400
to work as a team.

176
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,760
Now, today, the biggest problem

177
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,840
over the decades

178
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,120
has been measurement of pain.

179
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,760
How do we know

180
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,160
how much pain one perceives, right?

181
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,840
So, do we do a well test?

182
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
Do we look at saliva?

183
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,840
Do we look at

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,080
patient reported outcome measures?

185
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,560
And so here comes,

186
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,040
this is where we have big data

187
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,960
come to the rescue, right?

188
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,880
And patients can tell us

189
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,320
on their phones or devices,

190
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,120
Hey, you know,

191
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,840
I'm feeling great today.

192
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,640
I was able to do this much.

193
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,960
I could demonstrate that I was able

194
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,640
to walk this many steps today.

195
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,120
Right.

196
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,840
But what has been

197
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,480
the greatest advancements, let's say,

198
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,880
over the past 20 years in pain medicine?

199
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,560
Has it been really big data

200
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,320
and the ability to now understand

201
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,280
different similarities

202
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,640
and differences amongst patients?

203
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,200
Or, is it more of the medicine itself

204
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,880
that has been developing?

205
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,120
So, I mean, I think that

206
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,600
when I was an age 30 years ago,

207
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,640
almost 20, 30 years ago,

208
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,720
we were looking at using electrodes

209
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,720
to measure pain with animals.

210
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,280
Now, we're able to

211
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,120
put biosensors on human beings

212
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,160
and follow them longitudinally.

213
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,720
And so, that is a huge advance.

214
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,120
And really, it's something that we can,

215
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,800
it's almost a gift

216
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
to pharmaceutical companies

217
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,320
and so forth.

218
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,880
Because, now we're able

219
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,120
to have reliable models, if you will,

220
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,840
to look at how well they're,

221
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,440
it's not necessarily a validated tool

222
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,680
for the FDA for approval and so forth.

223
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,880
But it is for physicians giving us a tool

224
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,600
to follow our patients,

225
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,600
not just once a month, but real time.

226
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,120
And by the way,

227
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,320
the CMS has caught on to this.

228
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,960
And CMS is the body

229
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,520
that determines reimbursement

230
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,280
pretty much in this country.

231
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,880
They decide what Medicare pays

232
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,800
and then everybody follows.

233
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,600
All the players follow.

234
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,640
So, what they will been able to say

235
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,600
is that we want people

236
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,560
to be monitored longitudinally, so there's

237
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,400
chronic disease management codes now.

238
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,160
They started just last year,

239
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,760
which is giving a huge boost to apps.

240
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,120
Right?

241
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,960
So, an endocrinologist

242
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,960
will follow a patient

243
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,440
for a certain amount of time every month

244
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,760
and be able to look at them

245
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,000
not just once a month or periodically

246
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,160
or with a log that someone brings you,

247
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,080
but actual data.

248
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,840
Real time, actually with the sensor.

249
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,480
So, these types of things

250
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,280
have now come to a field

251
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,720
that is actually very complex.

252
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,480
And extrapolating this,

253
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,960
this isn't just specifically

254
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,520
about the doctor

255
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,720
following a specific patient.

256
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,200
But, everybody today,

257
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,640
I have right here this ring

258
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,720
that I usually put on.

259
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,760
But my girlfriend doesn't like

260
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,320
when I put it on during the day,

261
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,600
so, I'm taking it off for now.

262
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,440
Sorry, Carly.

263
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,800
And this ring measures

264
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,040
my heart rate constantly,

265
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,760
very accurately measures my sleep.

266
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,880
And today, there are

267
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,200
so many devices around

268
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,600
where an Apple Watch or this ring

269
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,360
where I'm asking these devices

270
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,560
to measure things for me.

271
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,600
Ideally, obviously,

272
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,640
I'd like this to be integrated

273
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,560
with my primary physician so that

274
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,560
they can get an alert automatically.

275
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,000
Like, something's wrong with Michael.

276
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,040
We better reach out.

277
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,000
This is obviously even more important

278
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,480
with people that are sick.

279
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,160
Or I'm thinking about my grandparents,

280
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,840
that irregularities can unfortunately

281
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,040
lead to a tragedy.

282
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
And sometimes, it is time that saves.

283
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,880
But Ofer, I'd love to transition

284
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,080
also to MedTech.

285
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,280
Because you have a fascinating

286
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,880
joint responsibility of both

287
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,200
running the division of pain medicine,

288
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,920
but also an investment arm.

289
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,240
Both a part of J-Ventures and outside.

290
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,040
So, talk to me about MedTech in general

291
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,480
and which areas of this

292
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,320
are you excited in?

293
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,200
How do you go about your ideas there?

294
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,640
Right. So, basically, my day job,

295
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,440
if you will, is to care for patients.

296
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,720
And basically, what I has been

297
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,280
is develop a program out east

298
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,960
in Stamford, Connecticut,

299
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,200
that's part of the Columbia system,

300
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,280
Columbia University system.

301
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,600
That you're an assistant professor there.

302
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,080
Right?

303
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,800
Right. Right.

304
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,640
So, we're basically able to develop

305
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,560
a system that will provide outcomes

306
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,760
for patients that we're interested in.

307
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,560
So, we have an inpatient program

308
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,400
for pain management

309
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,440
where we cover patients

310
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,280
in the hospital and optimize

311
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,400
their pain management needs

312
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,480
and thereby optimize hospital outcomes.

313
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,960
And we also have

314
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,400
a population health approach

315
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,840
where we take care of out-patients

316
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,520
with chronic pain.

317
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,080
So, that is what I do.

318
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,920
And I try to drive the bus a little bit

319
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,640
in terms of the philosophy.

320
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,080
But also, we take care of patients

321
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,840
and we love to do it.

322
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,120
By the way, why did you choose

323
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,120
specifically pain medicine

324
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,040
and not any other type of doctor?

325
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,680
Why are you excited about

326
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,280
working with patients with chronic pain?

327
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,720
So, it's a good question.

328
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,640
I mean, it's obviously

329
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,640
a very challenging group of patients.

330
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,040
It's neuroscience.

331
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,400
And I'm a basic scientist.

332
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,680
And I've come from there.

333
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,960
And I was involved in working

334
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,040
with one of the teams

335
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,000
that we're working on one of the receptors

336
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,520
that are integral into chronic pain.

337
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,840
And so, fell into the field.

338
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,600
But I love working with patients

339
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,800
and I enjoy educating.

340
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,640
And I was at Stanford in California

341
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,000
and in a wonderful environment

342
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,240
Looking at pain and studying pain.

343
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,520
And caring for patients

344
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,400
that have rare pain conditions.

345
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,640
And it's just been something

346
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,360
that I really enjoy to do.

347
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,400
And some of these patients

348
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,480
really have difficult stories.

349
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,720
And it's been very rewarding

350
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,080
to at least for some of these patients,

351
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,320
increase their activities daily living,

352
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,040
improve their function.

353
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,440
That's really what it's all about.

354
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,040
How much of this

355
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,040
is investigative Sherlock Holmes?

356
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,320
Like I would need to figure out

357
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,480
why you're feeling this way, versus,

358
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,560
Oh, I've seen your case 100 times.

359
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,600
Here is the prescription.

360
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,920
Go, do these exercises

361
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,840
and let me know how you feel.

362
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,320
Which of the two is it more?

363
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,320
So, I mean, I think it depends

364
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,600
on the type of pain medicine

365
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,200
that you're practicing.

366
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,240
I think that, 90% of a lot of practices

367
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,680
is back pain, neck pain.

368
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,800
And a lot of medicine these days,

369
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,320
it's become very prescriptive, right?

370
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,480
I think that, my model has been

371
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,760
where I work and with my partners is that

372
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,000
we have more of an academic model

373
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,600
and we see patients from regionally

374
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,120
and we see some interesting cases.

375
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,560
And we'd like to spend a lot of time

376
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,160
working with patients cognitively

377
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,960
and making them feel

378
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
like they're pumped

379
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,640
when they leave the office.

380
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,760
that they're going to get better.

381
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,920
And we have a plan.

382
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,520
So, it's all about being a good doctor

383
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,680
at the end of the day.

384
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,640
I love that.

385
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,430
And so, yeah, it's all about that.

386
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,560
That's amazing. Okay.

387
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,400
So now, going back to my original question

388
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,560
about MedTech.

389
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,520
Tell me a little bit about

390
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,480
this intersection between you as a doctor,

391
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,520
your responsibilities, caring for patients

392
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,760
and getting that satisfaction.

393
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,840
But also being on the forefront

394
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,040
of these technologies and thinking ahead

395
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,320
of what's coming up next.

396
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,400
Right. So, having trained

397
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,280
in Stanford, in California,

398
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,960
it's a really a wonderful opportunity

399
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,200
to really work with some

400
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,600
really interesting people

401
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,800
and be able to appreciate

402
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,240
some problems in our field.

403
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,360
And work with engineers

404
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,280
and business professionals

405
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,040
and be able to answer

406
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,160
some of those questions and investigate.

407
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,280
So, working in that area, in the region,

408
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,600
it was, I was able to work

409
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,480
with some interesting people,

410
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,840
whether it was Doximity,

411
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,240
or some other folks in the area.

412
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,120
And so, it's been really great

413
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,040
to push the envelope

414
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,360
and really try to bring questions

415
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,200
and needs from the clinic.

416
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,480
And be able to meet some folks,

417
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,520
to be able to accomplish some,

418
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,880
to answer some of those questions.

419
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,480
And to develop some technology

420
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,840
to answer some of those questions.

421
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,800
And now, as an early stage investor,

422
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,680
I mean, why J-Ventures?

423
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,320
Why go and be in the MedTech space?

424
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,360
It sounds like you have your hands full,

425
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,960
being the chief division of pain medicine.

426
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,960
Yeah. We certainly don't have much time

427
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,480
on our hands.

428
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,040
But it's just really wonderful

429
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,880
to not only be part of these teams,

430
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,520
but also be able to listen

431
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,920
to what other people have worked on

432
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:59,520
and really be part of Oded Hermoni's team.

433
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,840
It's just been a wonderful experience

434
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,960
to be part of that kibbutz.

435
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,840
And and learn as well, obviously,

436
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,640
in the process.

437
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,960
And meet some wonderful individuals,

438
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,120
have virtual coffee

439
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,360
with some wonderful individuals.

440
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,960
So, it's just been, I'm very thankful

441
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,040
to be able to be part of that team.

442
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,200
Wonderful.

443
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,800
And listen, I mean, I think that

444
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,920
it's always interesting to innovate

445
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,600
and to think about what's in the future

446
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,280
of our field.

447
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,080
And it's really interesting.

448
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,920
I had a patient several years ago

449
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,560
at the time where

450
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,240
if you asked five people,

451
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,240
I think some of them might have said,

452
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,760
"Telemedicine is never going to work."

453
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,440
I think clearly now,

454
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,040
we think very differently

455
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,320
than most of us would do.

456
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,240
But, someone came to the office

457
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,440
and he was 80 years old

458
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,960
at the time, probably. He said,

459
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,320
"Listen, when I was a kid,

460
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,560
physicians would come to your house."

461
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,080
"And now, I've got to come to the office."

462
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,920
And then it really struck me that,

463
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,120
I was in an office.

464
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,840
there's magazines, there's a waiting room,

465
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,320
and this is just really

466
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,920
an artifact of history, most likely.

467
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,760
Right?

468
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,200
So, now we're able to see the patient.

469
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,800
Used to be horse and buggy,

470
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,200
then we used to come to the house.

471
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,040
For a while we had the office experience.

472
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,240
And I think that in the future,

473
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,240
there will probably be a hybrid.

474
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,360
And we just can get better and better

475
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,040
at not only seeing patients remotely,

476
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,360
but also, as we said,

477
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,600
follow them over time

478
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,120
without necessarily interacting

479
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,240
with them personally.

480
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,280
It might be box,

481
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,160
it might be biosensors and so forth.

482
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,560
I think it was an insane experience.

483
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,640
I mean, it's the right word for it.

484
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,080
It was an insane experience

485
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,320
that I needed last week,

486
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,040
when we chatted,

487
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,880
I wanted to get a covid test

488
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,840
during this crazy pandemic.

489
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,000
And I would like to shift

490
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,400
the conversation to covid as well.

491
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
And I got on my phone

492
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,280
and I hopped on with my Stanford doctor

493
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,200
and she asked to see my ID,

494
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,560
hence the phone to know that it's me.

495
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,240
And, within ten minutes

496
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,800
I was done with a referral

497
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,600
and a full diagnosis

498
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,800
of what she thinks

499
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,760
was a follow up over SMS.

500
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,360
And I was blown away, I said,

501
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,640
"Why would I ever want to spend an hour

502
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,520
going to the office,

503
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,480
waiting in the waiting room,

504
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,720
getting sick from somebody else,

505
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,880
potentially, if I could just do it here."

506
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,200
Oh, and by the way, if I can send

507
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,240
my Apple Watch messages to her

508
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,440
and my ring sleep data to her,

509
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,960
then she doesn't she needs to ask me

510
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,720
half the questions

511
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,480
because she has everything already.

512
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,960
So, I think it's incredible.

513
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,640
But Ofer, give me your two cents

514
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,920
on what's happening now.

515
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,280
It's really a unique time,

516
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,600
especially, I'm sure, as a doctor.

517
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,320
So, what's happening?

518
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,360
Where are we headed?

519
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:37,840
What are some

520
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,680
interesting things over there?

521
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,000
Right. So I think that fortunately,

522
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,120
where I am right now,

523
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,720
in my house where we have

524
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,760
zero cases right now after having

525
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,640
at a peak 150 patients a day with covid.

526
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,360
So, luckily, I think that all the efforts

527
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,400
have been rewarded, at least for now.

528
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,200
I think that you hit the nail on the head.

529
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,880
I mean, I think that

530
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,440
one of the bigger developments with covid

531
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,640
for medicine has been the acceptance.

532
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,440
The wide acceptance of Telehealth

533
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,160
and the amount of investment

534
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,160
that's gone into it.

535
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,240
And really, what's driven this

536
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,480
is the decision,

537
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,120
that was a prudent decision

538
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,920
on the government's part

539
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,800
and CMSs part to basically provide

540
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,480
the same amount of reimbursement

541
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,400
for Telehealth,

542
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,680
as they would for in-person visits.

543
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,280
And once that incentive was done

544
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,360
to see patients personally,

545
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,440
then it was basically,

546
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,560
people did what they thought

547
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,000
would be easier and more efficient.

548
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,080
So, I think it's definitely

549
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,960
going to add efficiency,

550
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,280
not to mention what you said

551
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,930
was about communicable diseases.

552
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,640
You don't want to go to the office

553
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,040
if you're ill.

554
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,760
We do that all the time.

555
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,880
Now, with covid, very clearly,

556
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,800
they'll tell you if you're feeling sick,

557
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,040
you call us and then we determine

558
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,280
what the next step would be.

559
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,360
But for years,we've been going the doctor,

560
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,000
for being sick

561
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,240
with communicable diseases.

562
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,880
So, I think this is a huge change

563
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,960
and hopefully it's here to stay.

564
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,120
And, that's been really interesting.

565
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,360
But Ofer, you're getting satisfaction

566
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,040
from seeing the patients

567
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,000
that you're helping them.

568
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,880
They are thanking you.

569
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,800
You see that now

570
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,680
they're able to walk a little bit better

571
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,160
than they did last week.

572
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,120
And you're getting that satisfaction.

573
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,760
Are you going to get the same satisfaction

574
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,760
getting a WhatsApp video of them doing it?

575
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,520
Or them thanking you over the phone

576
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,960
instead of in person?

577
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,880
Because one of the things

578
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,960
that I'm now worried about is,

579
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,120
is the quality of health care

580
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,320
going to go down because doctors

581
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,720
are going to be a little less personal.

582
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,040
Because now, I'm just another

583
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,660
WhatsApp number.

584
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,600
I'm no longer in hour long session

585
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,680
where the doctor asks me,

586
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,040
Hey, how's your girlfriend,

587
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,520
or how's your dog?

588
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,160
Right. Now, well we have to maintain

589
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,920
a certain level of etiquette, obviously.

590
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,800
But I think that it's interesting.

591
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,840
I've seen patients for years

592
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,240
and I've never seen their kitchen.

593
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,560
Right?

594
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,080
And, all of a sudden,

595
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,640
I see them in their kitchen.

596
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,000
I see them walking their dog

597
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,160
and on the beach.

598
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,400
And I can see how well they're doing,

599
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,000
how well they're walking

600
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,960
and how well they may be

601
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,720
cleaning their house.

602
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,360
And what environment they live in.

603
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,640
Whether they live in a total mess

604
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,400
of an apartment,

605
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,560
or they could actually function.

606
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,560
People that have elderly parents

607
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,920
and they want to see,

608
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,880
they want to be involved in the meeting.

609
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:47,200
We can have our software that we use

610
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,600
that telemedicine allows us

611
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,360
to pull in the family members.

612
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,840
So, actually, that now allows us

613
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,400
to have a daughter in California

614
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,000
and an elderly patient in Connecticut.

615
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,120
And that's something

616
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,560
that we couldn't do before.

617
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,040
But I mean, not to mention the fact

618
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,800
that right now, listen, I mean, medicine,

619
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,640
this in the laboratories,

620
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,880
has been centralized.

621
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,000
So, there's a centralized model.

622
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,120
So, if you are going to get a test

623
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,800
for BRCA1, for example,

624
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,000
which is a gene we look for

625
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
in breast cancer,

626
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,680
all those tests go to one company.

627
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,960
Because they do high throughput

628
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,560
and they do it most efficiently

629
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,640
and cheapest, right?

630
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,040
And they have the patent for it.

631
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,480
So, in medicine, we still have,

632
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,680
pain physicians in every town

633
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,480
or we hope there is.

634
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,600
A neurosurgeon in nearly every town.

635
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,120
Right?

636
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,040
And we're limited to the market

637
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,800
that like a community bank.

638
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,640
But now we have access

639
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,040
to expertise anywhere.

640
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,160
So, you could be living in somewhere.

641
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,680
They may not be a metropolitan area

642
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,240
and you want to see a specialist

643
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,480
on some neuroendocrine tumor,

644
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,000
and that person might be in New York City

645
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,880
or MD Anderson in Texas,

646
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,600
and now you're able to access

647
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,080
that individual.

648
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:14,680
So, that is a huge accomplishment for us

649
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,280
on a national scale.

650
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,320
To be able to offer,

651
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,650
level the playing field for patients.

652
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:23,840
Incredible. I think, yeah.

653
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,440
I mean, I'm looking back I grew up

654
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,880
with severe severe eye problems.

655
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,160
Where growing up, I was basically

656
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,400
with a wet towel on my eyes and sunglasses

657
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,720
and nobody had any idea what's happening.

658
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,400
And we crossed seas

659
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,000
in order for me to see experts

660
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,320
so that they can take a look at my eye

661
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,720
and try to figure out what's happening,

662
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,160
and I obviously couldn't get access

663
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,320
to have the doctors that I wanted to,

664
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,360
mainly because of geographical barriers.

665
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,200
And the end, it was one doctor in Tel Aviv

666
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,840
coming from Russia who said

667
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,200
that by the age of 12, it will pass.

668
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,440
And it passed at the age of 12.

669
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,040
On my birthday, of course.

670
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,320
Whatever experts we went to

671
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,080
was it was good.

672
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,960
But I completely agree.

673
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,840
And I think it's inspiring.

674
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,520
And I learned so much

675
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,200
with this conversation.

676
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,800
So, I want to thank you

677
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,880
again for your time.

678
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,760
Really amazing.

679
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,840
But Ofer, before we leave,

680
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,440
I have to ask you

681
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,640
the most important question,

682
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,240
three words that you would use

683
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,440
to describe yourself.

684
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,120
Well, that's a tough one.

685
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,640
I hated to be put on the spot.

686
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,760
But I would like to be humble.

687
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,840
I'll use that as one of them.

688
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,120
inquisitive.

689
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,040
And I hope to be innovative and helpful.

690
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,960
Humble, inquisitive and innovative.

691
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,640
I love it. Ofer, toda raba.

692
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,760
Thank you very very much.

693
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,960
Thank you for the service you're doing.

694
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,440
Thank you for helping people.

695
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,120
Now at Stanford, but now it's going to be

696
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,400
around the world because everybody

697
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,880
is going to have access to Ofer

698
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,000
through their mobile phone.

699
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,240
So, thank you very much.

700
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,040
Thanks for doing this.

701
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,090
I really appreciate it.

702
00:28:48,090 --> 00:30:15,200
Take care.
