1
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,720
Okay.

2
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,120
Shachar Peled, thank you so much

3
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,800
for being on my show.

4
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
How are you?

5
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,280
Happy to be ... wonderful.

6
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,160
As you can see in the Galilee right now,

7
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,360
so no complaints.

8
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,040
I love it.

9
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,120
Covid-19 is horrible, it's horrific,

10
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,000
and it's disturbing so many lives,

11
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,320
but I have to say that I am thankful

12
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,600
that I get to have people like you

13
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,000
on the show.

14
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,920
People that are so incredibly busy

15
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,760
in the day to day.

16
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,480
And your response to my request saying,

17
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,720
"Well I'm in quarantine,

18
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,680
so we might as well

19
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,120
because I have some time now."

20
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,080
So I want to thank you, first of all,

21
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,440
for being so generous with your time.

22
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,720
Shachar, I have so much to learn

23
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,800
over these next 20 minutes.

24
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,000
So, I'm really gonna go fast

25
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,360
and I'm gonna cram you with questions,

26
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,120
because there's just so many things

27
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,160
that I want to learn. First of all-

28
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,800
I'm used to being on the other side,

29
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,760
so I'm ready for your questions.

30
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,360
I love it.

31
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,040
Okay. So, you're a journalist

32
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,520
by profession now.

33
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,880
You said multimedia journalist.

34
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,400
So, you cover agnostically

35
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,480
all sorts of different industries.

36
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,600
You studied at Columbia University

37
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,360
after serving

38
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,240
in the elite intelligence unit in Israel.

39
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,480
Been with CNN, European Correspondent now

40
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,920
for Channel 13,

41
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,680
but you're also part of the launch team

42
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,400
for i24 News, right?

43
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,000
That's all true. Yes.

44
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,650
Amazing. Okay. So, I got that right.

45
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,100
But Shachar, now it's your turn.

46
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,550
Walk me back through your journey.

47
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,880
How do you transition

48
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,080
from being a researcher

49
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,080
in the intelligence units

50
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,760
to being a journalist?

51
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,200
Right.

52
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,920
So, it was actually a very,

53
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,040
it felt very natural the transition.

54
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,600
If you think about it,

55
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
being in intelligence is all about

56
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,760
working with sources and writing reports

57
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,760
and working with a tight knit

58
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,000
group of people.

59
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,560
And what I actually realized

60
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,280
I wanted to do is continue that story

61
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,680
in order to shed light on various issues,

62
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,040
but on a wider basis.

63
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,040
So, journalism was

64
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,800
a very very natural shift

65
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,880
from what I was doing in the military

66
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,880
and in the prime minister's office.

67
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:49,080
And I found myself, I was debating at 22

68
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,160
as most of us do in Israel,

69
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,000
debating what my path in life will be.

70
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,640
And I realized that storytelling

71
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,200
and doing it to wide audiences

72
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,280
and unearthing stories

73
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,640
that I've never heard about

74
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,880
and have this this wow element to them

75
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,800
but that more than 10 people

76
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,560
can read them

77
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,640
because they're not top secret

78
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,880
was what I was meant to do.

79
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,880
And I started pursuing that route.

80
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,120
So right after my studies,

81
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,800
I worked for Channel Two News

82
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,040
which was the largest,

83
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,200
and still is the largest,

84
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,480
commercial news channel in Israel.

85
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,640
From there,

86
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,120
I had the amazing opportunity

87
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,720
to be part of this media startup, i24 News

88
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,760
the first ever international,

89
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,000
multi-language channel in Israel.

90
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I personally grew up,

91
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,960
my upbringing was in London.

92
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,720
So I had good English,

93
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,320
and this channel was looking for

94
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,480
English, native English speakers,

95
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,080
French speakers, and Arabic speakers.

96
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,400
So I could get this opportunity

97
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,280
to become an on-air correspondent

98
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,880
which I did for about three years.

99
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,920
And from then shifted on

100
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,040
to life in New York.

101
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,760
As you mentioned,

102
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,520
my master's in Columbia Journalism School

103
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,960
which was a ride in its own right.

104
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,320
A career in CNN,

105
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,160
both New York and in London.

106
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,760
Wow.

107
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,920
And now I'm usually based in Europe.

108
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,680
Right now, quarantined in Israel.

109
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,320
But this shift has been a roller coaster

110
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,560
and a wonderful ride.

111
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,680
Shachar, I want to learn a little bit more

112
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,560
about your take on this idea

113
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,200
that you're unearthing stories

114
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,440
within the IDF

115
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,520
and the prime minister's office.

116
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,640
You mentioned these are stories

117
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,520
that are read by 10 people.

118
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,840
And now you're shifting

119
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,280
to unearthing stories

120
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,560
that are going to be watched

121
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,040
by dozens of thousands,

122
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,160
if not hundreds of thousands.

123
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,120
So, talk to me about that shift.

124
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,520
And I want to hear a little bit about

125
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,400
your take on the responsibility

126
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,000
that you hold on unearthing these stories

127
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,480
because like we just talked

128
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,800
before we started,

129
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,200
I'm looking at the work that you're doing

130
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,600
and I'm saying,

131
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,720
Okay. Well, I'm watching you

132
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,680
cover this story.

133
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,680
You covered a story

134
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,280
of Eritreans in Israel, right?

135
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,920
With the protest back then.

136
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,200
And I watched that story

137
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,280
and it was phenomenal.

138
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,960
And then I kept thinking to myself like,

139
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,040
Wow. These were amazing five minutes.

140
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,840
I learned so much,

141
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,400
but there must be another thousand minutes

142
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,560
that I didn't hear about, right?

143
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,440
And you hold the responsibility

144
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,480
of choosing which five minutes to show.

145
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,360
So, talk to me a little bit

146
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,590
about that responsibility.

147
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,720
Right. So, I'll take you to a

148
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,520
quick glimpse of behind the scenes

149
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,320
of what's happening really when you do

150
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,280
either a print or digital story,

151
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,320
and definitely in broadcast.

152
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,280
There are hours and hours

153
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,360
of footage usually.

154
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,240
The more the merrier.

155
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,400
You want to try and make a deep dive

156
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,200
into anything, any story you encounter.

157
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,120
And one of the reasons

158
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,680
I became a journalist was to

159
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,960
every day learn new things.

160
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,520
And one day be in the kitchen

161
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,040
with this chef who's doing

162
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,120
these creative things,

163
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,880
and the other day being in a

164
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,000
terror act zone and covering

165
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,600
things that happen

166
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,960
that are breaking news.

167
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,600
And the shift from cultural to politics

168
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,600
to technology to social issues

169
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,120
is so wide and so vast

170
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,040
that I found it fascinating

171
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,080
and I still do until this very day.

172
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,960
And so I love doing

173
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,000
this deep dive into stories,

174
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
but you also have

175
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,320
a limited amount of time,

176
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,520
a limited amount of paper.

177
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,080
Digital not so much,

178
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,240
but today you still have to limit

179
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,000
the amount of words that you publish.

180
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,040
Especially for my generation.

181
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,240
The scrolling generation.

182
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,200
These are not one minute bites.

183
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,440
It's hard to capture attention.

184
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,800
And it's almost there's a conflict

185
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,600
of interest that's saying on one hand

186
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,040
I want to capture the attention

187
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,080
with a clickbait.

188
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,880
On the other end,

189
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,040
I want to be responsible

190
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,440
and say truthful information, right?

191
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,240
That's very true.

192
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,160
And what you want to do

193
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,880
is keep the essence of the story.

194
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,400
So, if I'm covering a protest of migrants

195
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,640
and asylum seekers

196
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,760
or if I'm doing a story

197
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,760
about this one specific artist,

198
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,880
I'm always looking

199
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,760
at what the message it is

200
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,600
that I'd like to convey

201
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,240
what the other person,

202
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,240
what the story that they're telling is.

203
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,480
And I've been very grateful

204
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,280
and thankful that I was able

205
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,760
to tell some stories

206
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,600
that actually create change.

207
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,960
And that's what I would like to do

208
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,200
personally, as a journalist.

209
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,040
There's this I guess

210
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,160
stigma of journalists being objective.

211
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
There's always this,

212
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,960
you can't put your feelings into things.

213
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,720
It's no longer ...

214
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,040
When I studied journalism

215
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,040
and I personally worked that way,

216
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,120
I always find that there's something

217
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,480
that I want to tell

218
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,120
and there's something

219
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,680
that needs to be changed,

220
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,240
and I want to be the one

221
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,720
to help change that.

222
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,120
And especially working for CNN

223
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,840
that was prominent

224
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,160
when we tell a story that then,

225
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,040
as you said,

226
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,840
hundreds and thousands of people can see.

227
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,560
We created change.

228
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,520
One of the stories I did

229
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,600
that I'm most proud of

230
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,720
is highlighting Holocaust survivors

231
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,240
that live in poverty in the US.

232
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,080
It's a very well-known

233
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,120
well covered issue in Israel

234
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,000
and it's being treated,

235
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,280
but in the United States of America,

236
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,160
the empire of capitalism,

237
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,080
if you're poor you're poor

238
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,880
and you need to lift yourself up.

239
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,960
But when we're talking

240
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,280
about Holocaust survivors,

241
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,320
most of them are over 80, 85 years old.

242
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,560
This was surprising to me

243
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,400
that they have no structure

244
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,520
and no some kind of institution

245
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,720
that is taking care of them

246
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,200
from the state,

247
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,480
from the federal level.

248
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,840
And after doing this story,

249
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,720
we've received multiple and multiple

250
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,120
calls from individuals,

251
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,560
from organizations,

252
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,360
from nonprofits who said,

253
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,560
"I want to lend a hand.

254
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,760
I want to help.

255
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,680
Can you connect me to these individuals.

256
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,880
I want to do something about this."

257
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,320
So, that's just one example of how you.

258
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,760
And I spent hours and hours

259
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,560
with these people,

260
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,960
but the essence was to tell

261
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,320
their very specific story

262
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,680
in order to get them help

263
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,520
or tell another story's ... awareness

264
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,440
or tell another story

265
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,240
that would create some kind of initiative.

266
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,000
These are all things

267
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,440
that I'm very passionate about.

268
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,360
And how do you even uncover these stories?

269
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,680
So, growing up as an Israeli in Tel Aviv

270
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,600
and now in the Bay Area,

271
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,040
I have family that perished

272
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,720
in the Holocaust.

273
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,400
And I am very versed in the history of it,

274
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,600
but I never even stopped to think that,

275
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,840
yes, in the US also

276
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,200
we have Holocaust survivors

277
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,720
that don't have the structure

278
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,160
in this capitalist society

279
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,960
that Israel provides,

280
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,680
or is aiming to provide, currently

281
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,880
to Holocaust survivors.

282
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,640
How do you go about

283
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,000
unearthing these stories

284
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,320
and really understanding their value?

285
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,200
Because, I mean,

286
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,440
part of the idea here is

287
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,560
that you are unearthing things

288
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,000
that are not mainstream, right?

289
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,360
Right.

290
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,200
And I was actually very fortunate

291
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,800
to be the outsider

292
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,640
when I was working in the CNN newsroom

293
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,440
in New York specifically.

294
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,520
I was the only Israeli,

295
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,200
actually, I was the only foreigner.

296
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,080
Everyone there was American,

297
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,440
and our specific department

298
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,600
was about 50, 60 people.

299
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,280
And that actually allowed me to be

300
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,480
sort of the one that brings in

301
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,400
these alternative stories.

302
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,040
Things that others didn't look at.

303
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,760
And it was actually an amazing time.

304
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,040
It was at the height of the

305
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,000
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump campaigns.

306
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,520
And there was a lot of focus

307
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,200
on xenophobia, on the other,

308
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,640
on immigrants, on asylum seekers.

309
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,840
And in addition to that

310
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,080
being a fascinating topic for me,

311
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,560
I also found myself ... that

312
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,440
were different from the regular mindset.

313
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,840
And because CNN allowed me

314
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,400
this amazing opportunity to just,

315
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,360
here's a camera,

316
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,560
go out and explore Boise, Idaho,

317
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,160
and Baton Rouge, Louisiana,

318
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,880
and all these places I've never heard of.

319
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,520
And suddenly had this opportunity

320
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,040
to cover the campaigns there

321
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,120
and how people were reacting.

322
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,880
There was this whole issue

323
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,360
with North Korea, obviously.

324
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,840
And then we started interviewing

325
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,040
North Korean asylum seekers in the US,

326
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,600
which was fascinating.

327
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,100
And it was only because, I think,

328
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,960
I was the outsider that I was looking

329
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,080
for these outsider stories.

330
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,280
So that was a great opportunity.

331
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,520
That's just incredible.

332
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,240
And I mean, are there specific things

333
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,840
that you're particularly excited about

334
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,640
as you go about

335
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,320
Is it the filming of it, the interviewing,

336
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,880
the research in the computer?

337
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,360
Or is it the post-production

338
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,240
helping the editors

339
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,520
put the story together?

340
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,480
Which part of it are you most excited?

341
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,000
Oh, that's like choosing

342
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,400
between mom and dad.

343
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,320
Well especially in

344
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,520
the past couple of years

345
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,800
when I've been really

346
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,840
just a one woman band.

347
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,800
I've been the correspondent,

348
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,960
the photographer, the researcher,

349
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
the producer.

350
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,600
It's unfortunately and fortunately only me.

351
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,840
So, I'll give you an example.

352
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,720
We were in Paris

353
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,920
when the Notre Dame caught on fire

354
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,880
and obviously it was a historic

355
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,240
and devastating moment.

356
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,360
And at that point, obviously,

357
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,480
it's just me. By chance

358
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,560
I was with my tripod and camera with me,

359
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,080
and what I needed to do at that moment

360
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,080
... news and I'm on air all the time,

361
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,240
I had to do this combination

362
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,240
of filming myself, reaching out

363
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,680
and asking people and the police,

364
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,280
women and men that were there

365
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,320
what was going on.

366
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,240
Interviewing, being in touch

367
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,080
with the control room.

368
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,040
These are all things that the producer,

369
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,520
the camera person does,

370
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,440
the researcher does

371
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,560
and the reporter usually do.

372
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,880
Thankfully, my husband was there

373
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,800
to help me carry around the tripod

374
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,520
here and there.

375
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,200
But most of these things

376
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,920
I do by myself. And I love it.

377
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,120
There's a lot of adrenaline,

378
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,360
but I also will admit

379
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,280
it's a big challenge.

380
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:15,040
Sometimes I'm so exhausted

381
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,000
by the end of the day

382
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,960
that I'm asking myself,

383
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,320
"Why do I do this?"

384
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,120
But then the following day comes

385
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,080
and there's another story to cover.

386
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,880
To me, it sounds like

387
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,160
you're ready to transition from this

388
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,200
to running the control room

389
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,480
for a NASA launch,

390
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,800
because it doesn't sound too different

391
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,040
at this point.

392
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,640
By all means,

393
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,760
just give me the control panel.

394
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,080
I'll take care of everything.

395
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,080
How long does it take from the moment

396
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,280
that you understand that there is

397
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,920
some potential for something.

398
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,000
Yeah. There might be something in Arkansas

399
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,040
that we might want to cover,

400
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,320
this is interesting, to the moment

401
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,000
where it actually gets aired

402
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,320
to millions of viewers on CNN

403
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,760
and you get the message across.

404
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,640
How long does that process take?

405
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,840
It really depends.

406
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,120
So, if you're talking about CNN, again,

407
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,440
it's a huge, well oiled machine.

408
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,640
They have the resources

409
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,880
to just say even, "We're not sure

410
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,880
there's a story there,

411
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,400
Bbt here are plane tickets,

412
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,360
or a train ride, or a car,

413
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,760
or the accommodation that you need

414
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,240
to ... there's a story there"

415
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,120
There was one sort of murder mystery I did

416
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,360
driving for like five days through

417
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,000
it was Connecticut, Massachusetts,

418
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,240
I think a few states there

419
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,200
on the northeastern part of the US

420
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,120
just to try and chase a story

421
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,520
and see if there's bulk

422
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,720
and anything that we can

423
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,520
actually create content from.

424
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,080
So, it really depends.

425
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,120
And this was from one day to the next.

426
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,760
Just Shachar, are you ready on Tuesday

427
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,840
to take the car and just go on a road trip

428
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,280
around these states

429
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,520
to see if there's a story.

430
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,040
Others, you know, it might take time

431
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,640
if we have time to plan ahead

432
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,920
and see in advance if we can do

433
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,880
one story or another

434
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,680
then we do the planning.

435
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,120
Most of the time, it's not even

436
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,520
from one day to the next.

437
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,320
Now, with Channel 13,

438
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,400
as you know in Israel,

439
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,840
everything's last minute,

440
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,080
and we can sometimes decide

441
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,520
from one hour to the next

442
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,560
that I'm on this flight to Germany

443
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,680
to cover a story or wherever I need

444
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,920
to be across Europe.

445
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,120
It sounds exhausting

446
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,720
and exhilarating at the same time.

447
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,920
Absolutely. Yeah, that's true.

448
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,440
No, no that's just incredible.

449
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,680
And looking down at how now you operate

450
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,800
in different places.

451
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,960
And I'm really curious to hear your take

452
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,080
on the transition of journalism

453
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,200
to the different generations.

454
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,760
And I'm even looking at my nieces

455
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,680
who are now a few days old,

456
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,200
three years, and six years old,

457
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,160
and the way that

458
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,400
they're consuming information,

459
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,080
not necessarily news, but any information

460
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,000
is drastically different than the way

461
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,120
that I'm even consuming it.

462
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,320
And so, I'd love to hear a little bit

463
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,040
about your take on

464
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,640
how journalism is changing and adapting

465
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,960
to the younger generations.

466
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,040
And I believe you asked this question

467
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,120
to the person who ran the BBC News

468
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,600
right?

469
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,240
And so I'm especially curious

470
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,400
to hear your answer.

471
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,280
Well you did your research.

472
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,720
I have ... with a journalist.

473
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,920
I had to prepare a little bit.

474
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,200
Right. Very true.

475
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,560
I'm very impressed.

476
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,080
So, you know the phrase

477
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,760
from Pixar's Ratatouille,

478
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,040
"Everyone can be a chef"

479
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,160
or "Everyone can be a cook."

480
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,320
These days, I feel like

481
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,080
everyone can be a journalist.

482
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,760
You need the basic tools

483
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,440
and obviously some experience,

484
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,840
but with the platforms that exist today

485
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,320
to reach everyone and anyone at any time.

486
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,120
It's also the danger

487
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,720
and we can spend hours

488
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,120
talking about misinformation

489
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,960
and disinformation,

490
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,200
but it's also an amazing opportunity

491
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,840
to spread stories

492
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,160
and reach so many people

493
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,080
so very quickly.

494
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,600
And I look at myself today.

495
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,280
I consume news mostly from social media.

496
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,480
And I'm not talking only about

497
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,240
Facebook or places where you can

498
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,040
add a lot of text and explain the story.

499
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,680
Instagram today, Twitter,

500
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,360
even TikTok these days,

501
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,920
you can learn so much from these platforms

502
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,200
in terms of, just even getting

503
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,640
a new initiative or inspiration

504
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,760
from seeing someone

505
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,800
doing things and saying,

506
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,840
"Hey, that's new." or

507
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,320
"I've never heard or seen anyone

508
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,400
do that thing before

509
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,000
or ask those questions before"

510
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,240
And want to do a story from that

511
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,800
or get information from that.

512
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,560
And I think anyone

513
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,200
who's serious today in news

514
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,000
has presence in all of these platforms,

515
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,680
because that's where we get the news

516
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,480
and this is a way

517
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,640
to spread news as well.

518
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,840
So without a doubt, social media,

519
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,400
TV still exists as as does radio.

520
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,040
I can't say that much about print,

521
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,360
but everything that has to do

522
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,800
with social media today

523
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,360
and the platforms know it.

524
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,920
Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google,

525
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,240
all the big digital giants

526
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,320
they know that

527
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,040
that's where people consume their news

528
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,120
and their information.

529
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,480
And that's what they do.

530
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,000
They are now putting more and more focus

531
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,560
on how do you stop misinformation

532
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,760
and become a truthful,

533
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,160
justifiable news platform.

534
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,760
Right. So, I agree.

535
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,960
I mean we can talk for hours

536
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,920
about the dangers of misinformation

537
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,080
and fake news that come

538
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,920
with the democratization

539
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,000
of dissemination of information.

540
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
But what I'm especially curious is,

541
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,160
do you believe that 10 years

542
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,040
or 15 years from now,

543
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,360
we will need reporters

544
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,320
to be in front of the Notre Dame

545
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,360
in case something happens?

546
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,640
Or is it enough that we'll have people

547
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,720
holding whatever device they'll use

548
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,760
if it won't be already in our glasses

549
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,520
and talk while they're watching it?

550
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,520
Is there still room

551
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,200
for in-field journalism in 10, 15 years

552
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,760
if I become a journalist

553
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,800
simply by the virtue of me having a phone?

554
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,720
I actually thought

555
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,000
that you were about to ask me

556
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,960
...

557
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,600
and for that I have a very quick answer.

558
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,520
But for what you are asking,

559
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,920
... because your question is more interesting.

560
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,080
So start with the robots ones.

561
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,400
Well with robots,

562
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,520
what we can see today is that,

563
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,280
even with the basic levels of AI

564
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,160
that we have today,

565
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,200
it's not giving us stories.

566
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,760
When I go to YouTube,

567
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,520
and even if you make it better

568
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,440
and the aggregation of information

569
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,080
will be better,

570
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,360
then you won't get the levels of depth

571
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,120
and investigation that you want

572
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,760
from what currently AI can do.

573
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,280
And I don't see that improving

574
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:47,920
in 10 years.

575
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,520
We can talk about 50,

576
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,280
but to answer your question.

577
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,560
I think that yes,

578
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,320
anyone can become a journalist,

579
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,880
but you have to have the

580
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,680
I think, still, it's all about trust.

581
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,880
So you have to have the backing

582
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,840
and the the support of some kind of system

583
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,200
that people trust.

584
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,800
So, you can be an individual

585
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,640
and start reporting

586
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,840
and if what you are unveiling

587
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,640
is found to be truthful, interesting,

588
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,360
new, all the basics

589
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,680
and the fundamentals of news,

590
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,640
of course you can become a journalist.

591
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,600
It's all about practice

592
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,280
and experience of how to ask

593
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,960
the right questions and how to address.

594
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,920
You need that.

595
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,040
But very much so in journalism,

596
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,640
it's on job training.

597
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,760
And I'm saying that as someone

598
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,040
who has a master's in journalism.

599
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,920
Most of what I do right today

600
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,000
is not from school;

601
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,040
it's from being in the field.

602
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,720
And I think yes,

603
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
an individual can do that,

604
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,520
but it's obviously helpful

605
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,280
when you have The New York Times

606
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,640
or The New Yorker or

607
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,500
The Washington ... behind you

608
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,280
as not only a support system,

609
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,280
but as a way of others to trust you.

610
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,000
So I think in 10 years,

611
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,120
that would still be the case.

612
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,000
Shachar, this was inspiring,

613
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,120
and I learned so much

614
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,920
over these past 20 minutes.

615
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,680
I want to thank you again

616
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,640
for being so generous with your time.

617
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,480
Before we finish,

618
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,000
I have to ask you

619
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,240
the most important question:

620
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,680
Three words that you would use

621
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,920
to describe yourself.

622
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,280
Right.

623
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:20,080
So, I thought very hard on that question

624
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,640
'cause it's very very difficult.

625
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,200
So I guess the first,

626
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,520
which is a new word for me,

627
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,280
would be mother

628
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,640
since I have a six month old sunshine.

629
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,120
So and it's not only mother

630
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,160
it's, if I cheat a bit,

631
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,440
it's being a family person.

632
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,240
A family woman

633
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,800
'cause it's my dear dear husband,

634
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
my partner and my son who are now

635
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,640
definitely defining myself and my life.

636
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,280
The second word would be storyteller,

637
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,320
and I don't need to elaborate on that.

638
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,760
I think we've done that for 20 minutes now.

639
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,200
And the third, what was the third?

640
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,880
I think it's difficult

641
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,160
'cause it's trying to describe myself.

642
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,440
But it could be,

643
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,200
I don't want to cheat.

644
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,800
It could be anything from being

645
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,080
I'll let you cheat a little bit.

646
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,000
Okay. Thank you.

647
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,280
So, anything from being multidisciplinary

648
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,360
to just being honest.

649
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,480
An honest person.

650
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,480
Sometimes it's good

651
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,000
and sometimes it's a bit bad,

652
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,760
but I guess that describes me best.

653
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,200
Shachar, toda raba.

654
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,600
Thank you very very much.

655
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,440
This was inspiring. Enjoy the quarantine.

656
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,400
I see that throughout the filming

657
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,000
of this episode, it got dark over there.

658
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,640
Oh, it did. You're right.

659
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,360
But thank you very very much,

660
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,400
and I look forward

661
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,640
to continue seeing the stories

662
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,240
that you unfold.

663
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,600
Thank you so much.

664
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,960
It was wonderful.

665
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,320
Bye.
