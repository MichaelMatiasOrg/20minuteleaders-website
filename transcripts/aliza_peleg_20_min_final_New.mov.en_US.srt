1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,279
Getting ready to have a shower

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,279
to go for my morning meeting

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,239
and I open the suitcase and I say,

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,399
"Holy shit, whose?"

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,119
And you see a clown suit.

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,519
And I see, I'm the idiot.

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,199
I always wondered who are the idiots

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,959
that take someone else's suitcase?

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,650
Then I would said, "Shit, it's me."

10
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,039
Aliza Peleg, thank you so much

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,519
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,840
Good morning.

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,560
Hi, good morning.

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,160
Great to be with you.

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,720
It's fantastic to have you here.

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,800
First off, so we know each other

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,720
for many, many years.

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,280
We were recently reintroduced

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,520
through J-Ventures.

20
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,960
But the very first thing

21
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,080
that I saw about you is that

22
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,240
you are a board member of Asian Box,

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,520
which, like I mentioned to you,

24
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,000
is one of my favorite restaurants

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,080
of all time, based in California.

26
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,880
So, thank you for making it happen

27
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,440
and for allowing me

28
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,680
to have such a great meal.

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,960
Obviously, it's just one

30
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,560
of many, many things that you're doing.

31
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,200
I can't wait to talk about your career

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,320
and some of the insights

33
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,480
that you've gained.

34
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,240
Give me a second,

35
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,320
just give a brief introduction as to

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,680
some of the incredible things you've done

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,640
and then I'll let you take it from there.

38
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,480
But starting out

39
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,720
as a developer relations

40
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,840
for the Mac platform

41
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,320
all the way back in '91 with Apple,

42
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,840
to being a managing director at SAP,

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,880
to head of Global Planning

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,640
and Operations at Better Place,

45
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,120
one of the most revolutionary

46
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,000
and innovative companies

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,400
that spun out of Israel

48
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,920
with this great support of Shimon Peres.

49
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,400
Chief operating officer of PlanetSoho,

50
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,960
GM at NICE,

51
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,080
chief operating officer at Reali,

52
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:01,919
and now board members

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,800
of both Ayehu Software and Asian Box.

54
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,040
Aliza, incredible, incredible career.

55
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,520
But before we get into that,

56
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,160
you mentioned you have a fun story

57
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,800
to share with me.

58
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:12,960
Well, first of all,

59
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,360
thank you for that great introduction.

60
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,920
And it just shows you

61
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,120
how many years I go back.

62
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,520
And I have to thank you for being

63
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,800
a loyal customer of Asian Box.

64
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,680
It's been tough during the covid season

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,560
and trying to keep the service going

66
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,120
and feeding our amazing customers

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,040
with this very fresh and organic

68
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,920
and gluten free food

69
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,600
is indeed a challenge.

70
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,920
But we've been rewarded

71
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,800
by the phenomenal support

72
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,080
of our customers.

73
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,240
And keep it up and spread the word.

74
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,360
And we love your support.

75
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,760
So, thanks a million.

76
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,240
And that's really probably

77
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,680
the only thing that I've done

78
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,320
in my career,

79
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,720
which is not tech or software related.

80
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,280
So, it's an interesting,

81
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,440
it's a wonderful phenomena.

82
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,440
As for an interesting story,

83
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,640
I'm sure that there are tons.

84
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,799
The one that comes to my mind

85
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,520
is that I actually had

86
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,480
a breakfast meeting

87
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,000
with a CFO of a Fortune 500

88
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,560
with my pajamas.

89
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,480
How does that happen?

90
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,480
How does that happen?

91
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:28,120
So, one of those 5am flights,

92
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,600
that means you leave your house

93
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,080
at 2:00 in the morning

94
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,440
and you pack a suitcase,

95
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:34,439
and I fly quite often,

96
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,080
so, I fly what I call in my pajamas.

97
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,320
Which is just the worst sweats,

98
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,240
the most comfortable T-shirt

99
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,000
and sneakers,

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,760
and just to be able

101
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,640
to sleep in the flight.

102
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,960
And this is pre business class

103
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,160
where they give you pajamas.

104
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,520
This is sitting in coach

105
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,360
with my own T-shirt and sweats.

106
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,680
And I fly for a meeting

107
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,080
in the morning with the CFO.

108
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,920
And I land at the airport,

109
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,880
and I didn't believe

110
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,320
this would ever happen to me,

111
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,040
I took someone else's suitcase.

112
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,240
Wow.

113
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,000
Which looks exactly like mine.

114
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,880
I travel an hour to the hotel

115
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,120
getting ready to have a shower,

116
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,120
to go for my morning meeting.

117
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,080
And I open the suitcase and I say,

118
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,200
"Holy shit, whose?"

119
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,960
And you see a clown suit.

120
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,360
And I see, I'm the idiot.

121
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,000
I always wondered who are the idiots

122
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,800
that take someone else's suitcase?

123
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,680
And I would said, "Shit, it's me."

124
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,760
And it was horrific.

125
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,560
Aliza, I always wonder

126
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,160
who is that person?

127
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,480
Who is the idiot that didn't check?

128
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,000
It was exactly the same color,

129
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,560
the exact same size.

130
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,520
The good news is,

131
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,960
it had a phone number.

132
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,560
I called the guy and I said,

133
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,240
"Joe, I have your stuff.

134
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,000
Don't freak out."

135
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,840
He obviously left my suitcase

136
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,920
at the airport.

137
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,280
I immediately called the cab.

138
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,120
It cost me one hundred euros

139
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,720
each direction to just to drop

140
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,600
the other suitcase

141
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,000
and come back with mine.

142
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,920
But there was no time

143
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,840
for the meeting.

144
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,880
And I just went in my pajamas,

145
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,000
with my sneakers,

146
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,080
with this crappy old T-shirt,

147
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,760
and I walked into this beautiful,

148
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,160
immaculate office.

149
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,560
The guy was wearing

150
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,960
a white starred shirt

151
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
with a beautifully tied tie.

152
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,880
And I said,

153
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,640
"I'm sorry. I'm in pajamas."

154
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,880
That's my story.

155
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,480
Wonderful. Wonderful.

156
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,560
And I amazingly we're into

157
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,720
the phenomenal career that you've had.

158
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,320
Most interestingly,

159
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,360
if I'm looking at this amazing list,

160
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,720
I'm seeing a lot of vision.

161
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,480
And we talked about this

162
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,840
very briefly before we started.

163
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,760
I'm seeing companies

164
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,800
that are really revolutionizing

165
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,440
whatever industry they're in.

166
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,120
And one of the things

167
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,160
that I'm learning to appreciate

168
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,440
both through Stanford and J-Ventures,

169
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,080
is that most companies,

170
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,080
especially in tech,

171
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,080
are not necessarily

172
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,080
visionary or revolutionary.

173
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,440
A lot of them are nice.

174
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,080
They're great.

175
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,160
They're building upon predecessors.

176
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,000
But here I'm seeing

177
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,240
a good cohort of companies

178
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,240
that are really trying to break the mold

179
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,040
and do something else.

180
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,160
Talk to me a little bit about

181
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,520
why you're attracted

182
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:11,879
to these visionary companies.

183
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,959
Yeah. That's great. It's true.

184
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,159
My career does span across

185
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,239
very small companies

186
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,599
and very big companies,

187
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,679
startups and innovative

188
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,160
and not so startup and innovators.

189
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:26,279
So, it's true that I have been around,

190
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,600
but I am really attracted

191
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,320
to the visionaries.

192
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,200
And I think what led me to it

193
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,480
was sort of one thing to the other.

194
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,040
I'm not a visionary as myself.

195
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,560
I think that my strengths

196
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:49,160
have always been around execution

197
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,919
and operation and progress

198
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,120
and sort of connecting the organization

199
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
and grounding the organization

200
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,320
to the founders vision.

201
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,200
So, I think I found myself

202
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,080
teaming up with entrepreneurs

203
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,520
that have a phenomenal vision,

204
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,320
but don't necessarily know

205
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,640
how to connect that vision

206
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,520
into day to day execution

207
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:18,759
by a team that's focused,

208
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,719
that's functioning,

209
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,119
and that allows them to really

210
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,759
and truly realize their vision.

211
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,319
And I think being in that environment

212
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,679
of entrepreneurship

213
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,599
and when we really, really

214
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,160
fighting for existence on a daily basis,

215
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,080
yet we can't just stay in the clouds.

216
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,560
And vision without execution

217
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,520
is actually not going to be

218
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,320
a great way to succeed.

219
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,880
It takes a lot of honesty and courage

220
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,080
and maturity to come and say,

221
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,760
I don't see myself

222
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,080
as somebody that's visionary,

223
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,760
but I know that my strengths

224
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,680
are connecting the dots

225
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,480
when you take somebody with a vision

226
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,760
and what needs to happen

227
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,600
in order to get to that vision.

228
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,480
And I really, it inspires me

229
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,680
because I think that,

230
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,760
especially growing around the community

231
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,600
that mean that you sort of expect

232
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,520
every young entrepreneur to be visionary

233
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,720
and all do it yourself

234
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,000
and you can do everything.

235
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And having that honesty

236
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,440
and the courage to say

237
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,720
these are things that I'm good at,

238
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,800
these are things that I'm not good at

239
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,960
and I want to capitalize

240
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,480
on what I'm really good at.

241
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,600
And for you, that's the role

242
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,400
of the chief operating officer.

243
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,520
I haven't had the pleasure

244
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,720
of having too many COOs

245
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,080
on the show, not nearly,

246
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,360
especially with the background

247
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,320
that you have here.

248
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,080
What is the role of the operating officer

249
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,080
within both a small startup

250
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,400
and the larger organization?

251
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
That's great.

252
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,200
And I also want to,

253
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,520
before I go into the details,

254
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,280
I'll also explain

255
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,640
and maybe that's a fun fact, too,

256
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,360
it wasn't only that I

257
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,920
necessarily chose that

258
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,760
or understood that quickly early on,

259
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,880
I think I might have

260
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,040
demonstrated early on

261
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,360
and entrepreneurs

262
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,760
discovered that in me

263
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,080
and pulled me into it more than I said,

264
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,440
"This is what I do well."

265
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,320
I did work with an entrepreneur

266
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,880
without mentioning names

267
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,080
who started the second company

268
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,920
and wanted me to join and I said,

269
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,240
"You know what?

270
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,720
I need a little bit of time off between,

271
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,000
I'll wait a while

272
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,800
and I'll join you later."

273
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,280
And his answer to me,

274
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:31,079
"No worries. I'm going to start now.

275
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,000
You can join whenever you want.

276
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,960
I just want to make sure

277
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,200
that the later you start,

278
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,800
the more you'll have to clean up."

279
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,880
And then I said,

280
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,840
"Okay. I'll see you Monday morning."

281
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,480
And that was the end of my time off.

282
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,600
Because I think he coined it

283
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
better than I.

284
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,160
That's beautiful.

285
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,920
So, not so nice way to describe it,

286
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,560
is to clean up the founders

287
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,520
or the entrepreneurs

288
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,720
or the visionaries shit.

289
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,600
That's one part of the job.

290
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,760
One way of describing it.

291
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,760
A nice way of describing it

292
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,280
is really to try

293
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,320
and get the machinery going,

294
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,600
really to try and get a rhythm, right?

295
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,080
That there's a rhythm of planning

296
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,280
and executing and measuring,

297
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,840
learning from it, moving on,

298
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,520
planning again, executing,

299
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,560
measuring and learning.

300
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,040
So, it's something to keep

301
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,280
the organization accountable

302
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,880
to we know what we're doing,

303
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,600
we're doing it.

304
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,040
And we said we would do it,

305
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
we're doing it.

306
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,160
And we said we did it.

307
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,960
And then we move on.

308
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,880
And have the ability to sort of

309
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,400
get that into some kind of a spirit

310
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,920
without being too bureaucratic,

311
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,240
without being too slow.

312
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,360
But if you don't measure

313
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,520
and if you don't really understand

314
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,800
and if you don't learn,

315
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,040
you can get off track

316
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,160
really, really quickly

317
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,000
and sort of forget where you started.

318
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,720
And sometimes the vision is so far out.

319
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,400
And this vector, you have to sort of be

320
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,480
quite sure on the vector

321
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,120
and now, it's okay to pivot,

322
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,160
it's okay to change,

323
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,200
it's okay to go in a zigzag.

324
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,080
But I believe in conscious zigzag.

325
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,440
And in understanding

326
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,640
and proactive zigzag versus reactive.

327
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,920
I love that.

328
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,400
So, do you see

329
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,320
a very big difference between

330
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,800
the chief operating officer of a startup

331
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,000
and that of a large company?

332
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,920
Because I'm sure

333
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,680
it's two different worlds, right?

334
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,560
On one hand,

335
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,200
you're talking about potentially cleaning

336
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,560
after that visionary's mess.

337
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,160
And obviously,

338
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,520
it's not because they're messy,

339
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,680
but it's because part of the role

340
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,520
requires that they do run quickly

341
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,520
and they try different things,

342
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,600
they break things.

343
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,680
And you need to have that figure

344
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,320
that comes and says,

345
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,920
okay, let's put some order here

346
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,560
and make sure that we're aligning

347
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,960
to our vision.

348
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,520
So, what are the sort

349
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,600
of the distinctions between the two?

350
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,240
Well, first there are distinctions.

351
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,600
And I just hope, for the sake of clarity,

352
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,200
I wasn't the COO in large companies,

353
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,440
in larger companies, I was more a GM

354
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,560
or a managing director of a big unit.

355
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,320
So, that was more

356
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,440
of an overall business leadership role,

357
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,080
either a line of business.

358
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,640
You know, NICE, I managed

359
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,160
the 200 million dollar line of business.

360
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,200
Or let's say, I was the head of,

361
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
I was the managing director

362
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,560
of SAP Labs in the US,

363
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,720
which was the largest lab

364
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,800
outside of Germany.

365
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,640
And I also led the lab network,

366
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,960
which was seven labs

367
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,320
outside of Germany.

368
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,800
So, that was a different kind

369
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,840
of an operating.

370
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,200
So, that's an operating role.

371
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,080
But it's not the COO.

372
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,960
In the startup world,

373
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,600
I think it really depends.

374
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,360
It's not appropriate for a startup

375
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,400
with seven people in the garage.

376
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:35,680
Right?

377
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,680
And you're just figuring out your product

378
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,840
and you don't really have

379
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,480
product market fit,

380
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,080
and you're still breaking things,

381
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,520
that's not really when you have a COO.

382
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,920
But when you've developed a product,

383
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,680
and we'll talk about

384
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,600
Better Place separately.

385
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,200
Because that was really from day one,

386
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,400
we were three people in the company.

387
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,000
Really?

388
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,160
It started in my living room.

389
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,000
We ran the company

390
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,520
for six months out of my house.

391
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,840
That's a different.

392
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,920
We'll talk about that.

393
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
But if we talk about

394
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,080
the general level of

395
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,280
startups, you know,

396
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,840
if you have been mainly

397
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,760
in the software world,

398
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,640
so, if you're six, five or six people

399
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,800
developing a small or a huge product,

400
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:18,879
but it's just the beginning

401
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,000
and you're breaking and you're not sure.

402
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,720
But once you start,

403
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,440
and when you say the word scaling,

404
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,360
it's scary because you can scale it

405
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,040
hundreds of millions.

406
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,880
You can also scale

407
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,240
from five people to 15 people.

408
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,960
But if you understand that

409
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,600
you're lacking some huge capabilities

410
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,320
around people management,

411
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,480
process management,

412
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,680
go to market management.

413
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,840
So, this is becoming

414
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,560
a little bit more functions

415
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,320
that are beyond the development,

416
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,640
the COO is not the only guy

417
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,680
who's doing the sales.

418
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,840
Right.

419
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,480
And either the CEO or the founding team,

420
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,439
take this upon themselves.

421
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,320
They really understand.

422
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,840
We need to start thinking about

423
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,480
our go-to-market.

424
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,880
We need to think about hiring.

425
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,600
We need to think about culture.

426
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,400
We need to think about processes.

427
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,840
If they have that kind of talent,

428
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,440
then there's no need for a COO

429
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,120
at early stages.

430
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,160
But when you need

431
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:17,999
when you feel, you know,

432
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,440
one guy is really the architect

433
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,240
and the other guy

434
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,600
is the head of the development,

435
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,200
then one guy can sort of

436
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,800
talk to investors and everything else

437
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,640
is falling apart in the process,

438
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,360
in the machinery, in the hiring,

439
00:14:33,361 --> 00:14:36,199
in the HR, in finance,

440
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,199
then you start thinking about,

441
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,279
is there a person who can aggregate

442
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,439
all the sort of stuff

443
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,039
together and run it.

444
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,839
And then if you start going

445
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,919
to customer success

446
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,879
and you have support,

447
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,039
then you have got to,

448
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,959
so, the more functions you go,

449
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,799
depends very much on the composition

450
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,200
and the talent of the founders.

451
00:14:56,201 --> 00:14:56,999
That's fascinating.

452
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,479
Aliza, I have to hear

453
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,599
the founding of Better Help

454
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,359
out of your living room.

455
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,600
I can't imagine anybody listening to this

456
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,760
who doesn't know what Better Help is.

457
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,040
Better Place, sorry.

458
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,880
Better Place.

459
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,720
Alon Matas from Palo Alto

460
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,440
is a great friend

461
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,280
and I've been talking to him a lot.

462
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,040
And Better Help is also

463
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,000
a fantastic company,

464
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,960
also a phenomenal company.

465
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,760
But better place is remarkable

466
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,200
because it really is innovation

467
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,120
through necessity.

468
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,360
A revolutionary story within Israel,

469
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,040
of course, with the late Shimon Peres

470
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,480
as a huge supporter.

471
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,040
And I remember growing up,

472
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,760
I think I was maybe 13, 14 when it was,

473
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,440
when I started seeing it roll out

474
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,520
in the big headlines.

475
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,800
And really what people

476
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,520
were excited about was

477
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,520
how revolutionary it was.

478
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,440
And here you have some

479
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,720
really courageous people

480
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,760
with a very courageous leader

481
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,480
in the government

482
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,800
that are running together

483
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,240
to really change the way

484
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,120
we think about consuming fuel

485
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,720
and how cars run on the road

486
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,400
and moving to a green planet.

487
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,120
Talk to me a little bit

488
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,480
about Better Place.

489
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
First of all, it's amazing

490
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,880
that you know so much about it.

491
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,640
And you were a young boy and it's great

492
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,640
that you spoke so beautifully

493
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,360
about the company.

494
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,240
You should have been part of our team,

495
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,400
probably even when you were

496
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,720
12 or 13 years old.

497
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,040
So, that's great.

498
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,280
It was absolutely

499
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,040
a phenomenal experience.

500
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,720
Unfortunately, it crashed badly.

501
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,040
And there's a whole session.

502
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,520
And I actually ran a small case study

503
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:21,199
at Stanford for 5 years.

504
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,480
Yes.

505
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,280
I run an annual case about

506
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,920
the rise and fall of Better Place.

507
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,760
Wow.

508
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,120
But an incredible, incredible leader

509
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,240
and a phenomenal visionary.

510
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,440
And we can all talk about

511
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,160
the billion dollar crash.

512
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,320
I wanted for a second,

513
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,160
put a plug in there.

514
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,720
I think that Shai Agassi, the founder,

515
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,920
the visionary and the leader,

516
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:50,040
I would say, probably, single handedly,

517
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,400
pushed the industry

518
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,800
to a point that that's why we see

519
00:16:56,801 --> 00:17:00,519
so many EVs around the world.

520
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,360
The system didn't work.

521
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,400
The change didn't work,

522
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,800
we made a lot of mistakes

523
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:06,879
or the vision wasn't 100% right.

524
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,599
But if I can give credit to him,

525
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,200
the single largest credit

526
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,840
that I can give him is that

527
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,400
I think that he single handedly

528
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,600
pushed the industry

529
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,200
in his confidence, in his arrogance

530
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,720
in his lack of humility,

531
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,000
he walked into the heads

532
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,280
of all the auto makers and said,

533
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,040
"If you don't do EVs,

534
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,960
you're going to die."

535
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,760
In 2007,

536
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,400
we went to the Frankfurt Auto Show

537
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,000
and there wasn't one EV on the floor

538
00:17:43,001 --> 00:17:44,599
or even a prototype

539
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,920
or even a demo car or nothing.

540
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,600
By 2010 or 11,

541
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,600
there wasn't a manufacturer

542
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,200
in the entire world

543
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,640
that didn't have an EV story

544
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,920
or an EV platform

545
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,200
or an EV strategy or something.

546
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,240
And then I think, Shai himself

547
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,680
and Better Place as his wing,

548
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,720
I think really, really moved that.

549
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,720
Even Elon Musk at that time,

550
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,720
who was already close

551
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,240
to delivering the Roadster

552
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,560
and delivered the Roadster,

553
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,280
even at that time, didn't publicly say,

554
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,120
I don't want to take away

555
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,400
from his vision at all,

556
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,920
that entire world should move to EV.

557
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:30,959
He was demonstrating

558
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,679
that if you were a Porche lover,

559
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,559
you can do that with an EV.

560
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,520
And EV is not a golf cart.

561
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,920
And you can have the best and fastest

562
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,280
and greatest car.

563
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,360
But mass consumption,

564
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,440
mass scale, no one spoke about.

565
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,960
And Shai really believe that

566
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,600
that could happen.

567
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,560
The reason in Better Place,

568
00:18:52,561 --> 00:18:54,479
there was a head of operations

569
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,240
from day one because

570
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,040
that was a huge undertaking.

571
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,240
It was obvious

572
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,600
that Shai would be outbound.

573
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,800
Government's, financing

574
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,480
regulations, big outbound activities,

575
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,160
would have zero attention

576
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,120
and also less capability,

577
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,680
but mainly zero attention

578
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,320
into the company.

579
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,720
So, the entire processes

580
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,120
of starting to build the team

581
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,640
from scratch.

582
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,640
And wasn't [--]

583
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,960
so many dimensions.

584
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,280
Because not only

585
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,560
the product was complicated

586
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,960
from software and hardware

587
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,240
and batteries and all the physics

588
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,480
and all the capabilities of hardware,

589
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,680
go-to-market, the global expansion,

590
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,520
the regulations, managing the finance,

591
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,240
managing the people,

592
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,960
making the legalities right that we knew

593
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,800
would be incredibly difficult

594
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,120
from day one.

595
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,840
So, we started with that structure

596
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,880
that we would move forward with.

597
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,600
I think that's remarkable.

598
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,400
And I think sometimes we tend to forget

599
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,160
that everybody has 24 hours in a day.

600
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,200
I remember that a few months ago,

601
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,360
somebody mentioned to me,

602
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,280
we were talking about

603
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,040
the presidency of the United States

604
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,240
and we're talking about

605
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,240
how busy they must be

606
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,840
and the different things they get done.

607
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,200
And then he said,

608
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,280
"You know, the president also

609
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,640
has 24 hours in the day.

610
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,120
They also need to sleep

611
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:26,599
for at least five or six of them.

612
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,840
And so we're not very different."

613
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,480
I think it's sometimes,

614
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,160
it's easy to forget that

615
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,480
you can't have one person

616
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,280
who just does it all

617
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,240
who is both a visionary,

618
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,640
outbound, inbound.

619
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,440
And you need to have

620
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,960
those different processes in place

621
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,480
and be very honest about them.

622
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,880
Be very intentional about them.

623
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,080
You used the word intentionality

624
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,800
and the zigzagging in the operations

625
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,280
in the beginning of this discussion.

626
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,800
And I love that word.

627
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,320
And I take it to heart

628
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,360
and I'm very excited as I go

629
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,040
on my entrepreneurial journey

630
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,120
to remind myself

631
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,040
to continuously be intentional

632
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,160
about what I'm doing,

633
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,200
who I'm doing it with

634
00:21:00,201 --> 00:21:01,479
and why I'm doing it.

635
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,879
But Aliza, tell me a little bit

636
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,879
about being a part of this team

637
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,199
that is really educating the market,

638
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,839
educating governments

639
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,559
and really going against

640
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,599
the grain at a time where no other

641
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,759
manufacturing company in Frankfurt

642
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,815
is showing any interest in it.

643
00:21:18,816 --> 00:21:22,215
What is that like?

644
00:21:22,216 --> 00:21:27,799
Well, it was great, it was tough,

645
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,719
it was excruciating, difficult,

646
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,279
but and it was also rewarding.

647
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,319
But it also had its challenges,

648
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,239
which eventually led to,

649
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,239
I believe, our demise.

650
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:45,399
Because when the gap between

651
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,039
your vision and execution

652
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,800
is widening instead of closing,

653
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,400
and also between

654
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,840
the story that you tell others

655
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,400
and the story that you tell yourself.

656
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,320
So, at some point,

657
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,640
I will get to it a little bit later, but,

658
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,840
it was huge.

659
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,000
Because we raised a lot of money

660
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,640
and because they were true

661
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,920
phenomenal believers behind it,

662
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,920
we could tell a real great story.

663
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,120
And you need a story

664
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,640
in order to drag people,

665
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,240
governments, countries.

666
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,480
So, you need a phenomenal story.

667
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,640
And we had that.

668
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,560
We had the money

669
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,040
and we had good storytellers.

670
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,680
And I think that creates

671
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,360
a very positive momentum.

672
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,960
And sometimes it's really hard

673
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,160
when I think of small startups

674
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,120
who have a great story

675
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,440
and they don't have the money

676
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,840
or the bandwidth or the capability

677
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,800
to actually tell it.

678
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,120
We sort of had,

679
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,640
we had the privilege to tell a huge story

680
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,320
and the means to tell it loudly,

681
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,240
loudly and beautifully.

682
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,280
So, at the beginning, you actually,

683
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,880
the momentum and the motivation

684
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,640
just coming from the

685
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,840
success of the stories

686
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,520
that there's so many people listening

687
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,720
and so many people buying into it.

688
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,640
So, it's misleading sometimes.

689
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,520
You get carried away.

690
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,920
You drink your own Kool-Aid,

691
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,240
which is a problem in of itself.

692
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,760
But that's how you get going.

693
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,280
You sort of really have to create

694
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,840
this positive cycle

695
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,120
of you tell the story,

696
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,360
people buy the story.

697
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,400
Then you tell people

698
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,760
that you told the story.

699
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,760
And we also hired phenomenal people.

700
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,920
And our team in Israel,

701
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,280
which was led by Kaplinsky,

702
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,800
they was amazing.

703
00:23:32,801 --> 00:23:35,399
And their execution capability,

704
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,759
both in the operation,

705
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,160
building out the stations,

706
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,680
building out the prototypes,

707
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,600
getting the call to work in R&D,

708
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,800
an R&D team that I think

709
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,600
work more than 24 hours a day,

710
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,880
I have to admit.

711
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,400
So, I think there was a lot

712
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,040
of small successes and progress.

713
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,840
I wouldn't call it small,

714
00:23:56,841 --> 00:23:57,759
that's not fair.

715
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,799
I think they were huge progresses

716
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,119
in certain domains

717
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,480
that helped us believe

718
00:24:03,481 --> 00:24:05,079
that we're making great progress.

719
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,199
But actually,

720
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,960
with such a company,

721
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,040
all the chain is huge.

722
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,520
There are many links in the chain

723
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,800
and you're only as strong

724
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,520
as your weakest link.

725
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,680
And the fact that some links

726
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:18,279
were missing doesn't help the story.

727
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,919
That takes time to figure out.

728
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,879
And unfortunately, at some point,

729
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,400
I did feel

730
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,000
that I can't contribute anymore.

731
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,040
I can't really fulfill my role

732
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,760
as I should.

733
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,960
And I decided to leave.

734
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,200
Very courageous.

735
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,280
I can't believe that

736
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,280
it's spun out of your living room.

737
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,840
And one of the first three people.

738
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,680
I remember actually,

739
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,560
I was very, I still am

740
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,480
a very, very good friends

741
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,320
with one of the Shai children, Jonathan.

742
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,000
And we spent many,

743
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,840
many, many weekends at their house.

744
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,920
Shai is also a fantastic poker player.

745
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,320
And he taught us a lot about his skills.

746
00:24:57,321 --> 00:24:59,599
And we were very passionate about

747
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,279
the behavioral economics behind it.

748
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,880
And during the games,

749
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,600
he would tell us a lot of stories

750
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,680
and a lot of inspiration.

751
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,480
And when I'm thinking back to,

752
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,960
why I'm so excited about technology

753
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,360
and why I was so excited

754
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,400
as a kid following this journey,

755
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,480
I think that was a huge part of it.

756
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,480
Seeing also from the background,

757
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,040
It's real.

758
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,160
It's not just in the headlines,

759
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,320
in the papers.

760
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,360
And the challenges are really tangible.

761
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,720
And at the end,

762
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,160
everybody's just a human being.

763
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,240
And we try to move the needle.

764
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:29,960
And I'm sure

765
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,560
that you have such incredible

766
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,160
fulfillment from knowing

767
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,000
that you really did move the needle.

768
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,720
And it's one of Israel's most courageous

769
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,920
innovative stories

770
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,160
ever since its founding.

771
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,480
I think it's just remarkable.

772
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,080
Aliza, I want to thank you

773
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,800
for being so generous with your time.

774
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,520
20 minutes go by very, very quickly.

775
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,040
But unfortunately,

776
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,560
the show is called 20 Minute Leaders.

777
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,600
I should have called it

778
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,560
an hour minute leaders.

779
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,800
But before we leave,

780
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,360
I have to ask you

781
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,000
the most difficult question,

782
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,400
which is three words that you would use

783
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,280
to describe yourself

784
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,280
and feel free to answer however you feel.

785
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,640
Well, maybe I can be

786
00:26:03,641 --> 00:26:04,599
a little bit generous

787
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,240
with the definition of three.

788
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,240
Like a good Israeli

789
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,920
and negotiate with you.

790
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,120
There you go.

791
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,800
Yeah, I think.

792
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,920
Wow, that's hard.

793
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,640
I'll take a stab and I'm sure

794
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,400
it's not the real or the only,

795
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:19,600
I'm sure.

796
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,560
But it's the ones that come to mind,

797
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,240
I think that,

798
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,159
not necessarily in order of priority,

799
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,920
I think is,

800
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,719
in a not self-proclaiming way

801
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,119
But I think it's something about,

802
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,119
integrity and authenticity

803
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,719
would be my first in terms of

804
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,519
I really do speak my mind.

805
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,639
Sometimes people don't even like it.

806
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,240
But I really, really speak my mind

807
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,040
and I walk my talk.

808
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,720
I try very hard to walk my talk.

809
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,960
So, I think the second one

810
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,600
which might be related

811
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,000
is courage.

812
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,560
And the courage is,

813
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,080
it's not the same courage

814
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,360
as the visionary.

815
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,240
It's not the courage of thinking

816
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,520
how I'm going to change the world.

817
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,280
It's not that kind of courage.

818
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,600
But it's definitely the courage

819
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:25,039
of being with people like that,

820
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,200
not knowing necessarily a way

821
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,280
payroll will come tomorrow.

822
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,680
So, dealing with the fears

823
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,320
and uncertainties of a startup,

824
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,720
that's an easier courage.

825
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,480
The courage that I

826
00:27:35,481 --> 00:27:36,839
think that I present is

827
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,840
I see [--] ramifications of me

828
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,560
doing the right thing.

829
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,480
My beliefs about doing the right thing,

830
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,000
whatever ramifications will bring,

831
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,920
I think that's courage.

832
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,880
And I wouldn't have known that

833
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,840
but I've heard people tell me that.

834
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,120
So, I think, that's a kind of courage,

835
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,560
you know, knowing that

836
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,160
if this will get you into trouble,

837
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,360
you may lose your job,

838
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,640
you may fall out of favor with someone.

839
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,680
But I think there's something.

840
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,480
It was wonderful until now.

841
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:14,679
Aliza, the walking the talk,

842
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,520
it's I think, not enough people do it.

843
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,800
And I think it's that courage

844
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,800
of actually executing on your intentions.

845
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,400
And we talked about

846
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,160
being intentional a lot.

847
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,520
And I loved when you brought up

848
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,080
the walk the talk with that first word

849
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,080
with integrity,

850
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,040
because its own world in itself.

851
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,120
And I think that,

852
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,000
knowing somebody that you can trust,

853
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
that you can trust that person,

854
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,760
and that you can really believe

855
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,400
that they'll do

856
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,360
whatever they say they'll do,

857
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,920
not necessarily that they'll do it right

858
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,280
or 100%, but that they'll actually be

859
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,320
intentional in doing it, to me,

860
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,720
that's what trust is about.

861
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,920
That's what partnership is about.

862
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,040
So, if it's okay with you,

863
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,440
I'll take that as the third word.

864
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,359
Oh, great.

865
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,919
I actually wanted to add a different one,

866
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,719
but I'm happy to.

867
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,559
It's a derivative, but that's perfect.

868
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,039
That's perfect.

869
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,399
I love it.

870
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,480
Aliza, thank you very, very much.

871
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,960
This was inspiring and thoughtful

872
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,600
and a lot more.

873
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,320
So, thank you for giving me the time.

874
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,520
And I look forward to keeping in touch.

875
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:16,760
Thank you.

876
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,320
Thank you for the opportunity.

877
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,120
It's been a lot of fun.

878
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,440
And now you owe me a cup of coffee.
