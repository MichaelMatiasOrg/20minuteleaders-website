1 You look at an animation show, like a show like a Cartoon Network and Adult Swim. It takes the network about anywhere between 500 to $700,000 per episode to produce, and it takes a very long time. Amit Tishler, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Finally, it's an honor to have you. Yeah. Thank you so much. Happy to be here. Animations, graphic design, technology startups, gaming, you know, we have so much to talk about because I know nothing about the work, the fascinating work that you're doing. Amit, first of all, who are you? Because you're not just the typical entrepreneur, are you? Probably not. The question, "Who are you?", like man, that is a big one. Am I really the one to define that? It's philosophical. Well, okay, let me try and summarize the weird history of my life, I suppose, or my career. Please. So, I actually started I think, like you said, I'm not exactly the boilerplate entrepreneur in terms of my story and my career progression. I started off from a 2D animation. So, I studied hand drawing animation. We're talking light tables, pencils. That was the first medium I've ever practiced in. And I studied in Israel. I'm originally from Tel Aviv. I guess in that regard, I am kind of like fitting within the entrepreneur box. Like I'm from Tel Aviv, that's a good start. And yeah, I studied 2D animation. And in my first few years I've worked in Israel, just like in the industry essentially gaining experience in the field itself, I was always that where the spirit of entrepreneurship was always there is that I did always want to do my own thing. If anything, I think I can safely say that I've been very opinionated about my taste, about how I think things should work, whether on an industry level or even in a granular narrative level. And that really drove me forward. Because one of my goals was I realized, okay, if I'm going to stay in Israel, sure, I'll be able to continue working but it's never going to take me one step forward, or one step beyond. I always wanted to get more into-- The glass ceiling. Exactly. Kind of the glass ceiling of just, you know, being outside of where real entertainment kind of comes from which is Los Angeles, where I live in today. And I knew that I kind of had to be here to really get things going. Especially because a lot of my interest was in developing original IP. Now, another really bizarre thing, or I don't know if it's that bizarre, I'm a big fan of everything I like. Like, I wear it on myself, like armor. And I've always been a video game fan. I also worked as a videogame journalist early on in my career, ended up really drawing me back and forth between work on software, whether it's like educational or game development, to TV animation. So, I've always kind of skipped between the two. I moved to the States at around 10 years ago. And I did my master's here and then moved to California because I was like, all right, if I want to work in animation, if I want to work in entertainment, this is the place. You've got to be here. And fun fact, before you moved to the US, you actually helped me compete in a doodle for Google competition for I think like, Israel's 60th anniversary. And so, thank you for taking the time to spend with you know, my eight year old self. I was amazed that you remember that. Of course I remember, because I sent it in, and I don't know if you even know, I sent it as if I did it. Totally fine. I just sat next to you while you did it. You have just documented your crime, sir. Exactly. Amit, before we continue, you're mentioning the animation space. Graphic design space. I know nothing about this. Give me the three-minute crash course, what is the animation space? What is the supply chain look like? What does an animator even do in their day to day life? That is a fantastic question, and it's multilayered. And it actually transitions really nicely into how I started my company, PopBase with Lisa and Richard. Perfect. So basically, like, as an animator, even though you are essentially the craftsperson making the show whether it's 3D animation or 2D animation, you are the one moving the character. Animation is in the end, motion. It's motion graphics. It's more specifically, let's say character based motion graphics is the best way to kind of define it, as opposed to just standard like motion graphics that are more graphic design based. And in the end of the day, this is a massive, massive industry that is cross generational, that's dealing with a lot of creative IPs. I think one of the things that I've seen both fascinates the tech industry and also really confused the tech industry is A, entertainment seems to have a really massive blind spot when it comes down to integrating technology, right, Into its pipelines. These are actually really old programming pipelines. As an animator, you come in and you work within the studio system, right? So, by the time that you come in, the process has already been through you know, a show has been pitched. That's your concept. The show has been developed and there are multiple steps in the process whether it went through a network or studio system. It actually gets incredibly complicated. And then by the end of it, when it actually gets greenlight into production, you're starting with pre-production. You're bringing in your screenwriters, then you're bringing in your storyboard artist, your designers. At some point, while production is already running, you have a channel that it's going to be on or you know what your distribution is. At that point, the animator comes in, you already have all of your guidelines, right? You're part of an animation team. You're usually working hand to hand with pre-production and post-production. In the end, the show appears on television. That's as simple as that. Right. Right. So, animators in many ways are as creative as they are, they are a cog in the machine where the top of the hierarchy are always the networks because they are primarily distribution channels. But many times, not always, they're also the IP owners. So, when you think of cross generational properties like Star Wars, for example, right, this is an intellectual property. And once again, intellectual property in the world of tech, and I've seen this multiple times when talking to because VCs, it means something very different. So, they're thinking of technological intellectual property. And when you're talking about intellectual property in Hollywood, very often or more often than not, you are referring to something like Star Wars, Spider-Man. Like you're talking about narrative driven intellectual properties. And the amazing thing about those intellectual properties is that they very rarely, if at all become irrelevant. And that's what I mean by cross generational. And you can see like Hollywood marketing is very aware of that. So, they make sure, now we're going to create the Star Wars for the younger generation. Right. And this goes all the way back to even fairy tales. Right? Stuff that is currently public domain. Because stories are, or good storytelling is immortal. Right? So, in many ways, if your intellectual property is a story and it has characters, and it's defined by those certain parameters, as long as you own it, it is potentially immortal. And it could be applied to games, to television, to really any form of entertainment. And that's where the licensing business in Hollywood comes from. You're a developer, you don't have your own intellectual property, but you say, "Hey, you know what? If I have the license for Spider-Man, I can make an Amazing Spider-Man game and I can monetize the living hell out of it." Well, if you have enough capital to basically give to at this point, Disney to license out the IP and they approve it, now you get to monetize on their intellectual property. Which means, they get part of the revenue, you get part of the revenue. Still a standard licensing model. But once again, the thinking is really all around the narrative. Right? Interesting. Yeah, that's how they define the intellectual property that's of the highest value in Hollywood. For me, I came from again, from animation to IP development. I started pitching original IPs to networks. I started selling and optioning shows to TV networks and getting in front of that pipeline. And when you're there, you get to see A, what they're looking for; and B, also what they're thinking about in terms of how to immortalize their own brands. Because if you think of a TV network, they can have like a lot of different TV shows. But in the end, they are trying, if they're a good brand, they're trying to define themselves. Like we are the branded mix of shows of this kind. We're telling these kinds of stories. We have a style, we have a, Disney has been teaching everybody how to do that while incorporating other brands underneath its umbrella. Right? They are basically the crown jewel of the industry in that regard. Both the crown jewel and the Death Star. Right? So, you can define it whichever way you want. But when we looked at that we realized that one of the weaknesses, and that goes all the way back to Hollywood's weakness, like when it comes to integrating new pipelines or technology pipelines is that everything is really siloed. It is an incredibly siloed industry. Their relationship, their fascination with the industry of like video games, which is one of the fastest growing, like branches of entertainment currently out there, has been, it kind of goes both ways with the video game industry obviously having an interest in Hollywood's big IPs, because that's what inspired a lot of video game developers to create what they're doing. But also, Hollywood's like fascination with anything that is a little bit more sci-fi, this is interactively, know that it's the future but they're also afraid of it because they don't fully understand it. And they don't know how to handle it. Which was why a lot of big businesses like Universal and Disney, even recently said that, "We're not going to try and develop our own things anymore. We're just going to go into a licensing model. So, if you want to make games based on our IPs, just go right ahead." I didn't know all this. It's so interesting. So, there's, and again, this has been evolving over the years. And it's been going back and forth. Like if you think of Disney as an entity, their department of Disney Interactive has shut down and reopened about like three or four times in the last 10 to 15 years. That's how fast this is moving of how they just [--] their new agenda is. But what was very clear to us is that, as a society and I don't think that this is a controversial statement at this point, we have a communication problem. Right? And it's whether you're trying to educate people, whether you're trying to entertain them, whether you're trying to market to them, or if you're just trying to explain to people that the world isn't flat in the year 2020, for some reason. You essentially have to have three key elements in order to really cut through the noise right now. You need to have the long and short form storytelling, abilities of essentially Hollywood, of shows of Netflix, of streaming media. You need to have the interactivity of video games because that really enhances knowledge retention. And of course, when you look at the younger generation, this is one of the main forms of communication they consume in multiple different ways. And you also need to have, and this is really key, you need to have the flexibility and the speed of response of social media. Right? Yes. A tweet comes out and exposes itself to so many people, so much faster than an entity, even as powerful as Disney can respond. Right? So, it's so much easier to get bad information out there and much, much faster than getting good vetted information that is controlled by you to your audience. And part of it is just that pipeline. If you think about creating an animated show, right? And this is where my experience comes in in this company. Because our entire agenda and what our technology does is take those three things. Right? The fast, flexibility, and response time of social media, basically social media marketing practices, interactivity of video games and the ability to tell an ongoing linear story take this three things, kills them in one stone and essentially build an infrastructure that puts them all through one ecosystem. Which is incredibly powerful and has taken us years to actually develop something that can work. But the idea is really to be able to create a form of communication that is sustainable, that is future proof. And we just believe that it's kind of inevitable. Right? I have to say, Amit, you know, you were talking about you know, PopBase and the journey that you've gone through. And I have to say that I've seen the product and the way that you're describing it as a communication tool and future proof, and that whole vertical of this integrated communication that, you know, is not really understandable for somebody coming from, you know, both from a different generation, even I'm considering myself as an older generation for this. Because, you know, I'm getting and producing information very differently in the way that, for example, my nieces do. Right. But I think the way you're doing with PopBase is really fascinating. And I'd love for you to share with me a little bit about what you're tangibly doing? What is PopBase? What is the technology that you're building? And what is the future that you envision with PopBase as an integral part of every kid's, I guess daily routine, as they go through learning and developing habits? That's a fantastic question. So, let me try and give you the aspirational part of the picture that will maybe help illustrate what it is we're aiming for. So, if you can imagine, let's say, a Netflix cartoon and animated show, they're also plays like an open world video game, like a Zelda, World of Warcraft, but has the ability to update its content and be as responsive as a social media brand. That's essentially the technology that PopBase built. It is a CMS. So, it's a web portal that allows us to control a creative IP within an ecosystem on any screen. Now, I'll illustrate that for you. Right. So, our go to market strategy right now, we're basically, we built this technology. We're like, we know this works. We know this is fantastic. We know we can drive these incredibly immersive story driven experiences and really just control a virtual world through a live ops dashboard in a way that isn't loose. And what I mean by isn't loose, it's not a creator platform. Which is what a lot of the focus of let's say, social media companies have been currently like. How do we make sure that anyone can just tell any story. Okay, but that is usually not the tool that a large brand, let's say, like Disney can use in the same extent. Right? Sure, they can distribute stuff on YouTube, now you're on the same playing field as everybody else. It doesn't really immerse you in the world, it doesn't allow you to control the whole thing. You're still relying on a separate ecosystem. So, what we're doing is that we're launching through the wellness market. Right? Which is a full of white space. It's got like $575 billion market right now where most of the apps that kids are given are either mini games, or they're kind of like they have the Fitbit approach of like I'm giving you an interactive task list that's gamefied. But what is the problem? I mean, what is the problem of the wellness space? Why is there so much money that is being poured in? You know, this is an extraordinary amount of money that any startup would love to say they're in, a multi $100 billion space. I would never imagine that the wellness communication space is that big. What's going on there? Look at where we live right now. The times of covid. And this is exactly the point of why we're saying we have a communication problem. Right? Where just the idea of teaching people, "Hey, wear a mask when you go outside because this is what happened. Wash your hands." Right? Basic hygiene, basic safety. Things that you think people should know or should learn through schools or should learn through, really anywhere. But right now, when somebody like if the FDA tweets something and if the president tweets something and if a troll tweets something, it's flat. It's the same amount of noise. Right? It's really hard for people to source out what's real and what's not. They need something trusted. Now for us, we're saying, we're trying to get to a generation that's early. Like our go to market focus is on children that are ages four to six. And part of the idea is, well, this is a generation that's growing watching Netflix, scrubbing on Tiktok, playing video games like Fortnight. You can't give them interactive test with apps or give them pamphlets and expect them like, yeah, they're going to retain this information. If the teacher comes in and goes, like, "Wash your hands, kids." They're going to go, "Hmmn, okay." Who cares, right? You can't do that. But we come from entertainment. And we know that one of the most powerful things you can do is it has to come from intrinsic motivation. Right? So, you have to want to engage with something and learn from it. So many people talk about how, you know, a certain, let's say, movie has made them feel something or give them the power to apply what they've learned from it. It sounds kind of silly, but it really isn't. These are stories that inspire you. And we want to create an immersive experience that is essentially speaking their language because it's quick, it's responsive, it's immersive, it feels like you're going into a magical world. You don't know you're there to learn it. It's more like Dora the Explorer, or Sesame Street. When you as a kid watch Sesame Street, you don't think you're watching something educational. As an adult you go, "Oh, okay, the count, it's teaching me how to. Oh, I see." But you don't think of that as a kid because you're too busy being in within the world that entertained. We're saying, we're creating a virtual world where every feature is something we can control and change on a minute, like on a moment's notice, through our dashboard in order to be able to respond to how people behave with it. In order to actually talk directly to our audience without even knowing who each person is. You think of Dora the Explorer. They always have these segments where you know, and it's very sweet and I get where it's coming from, but it's also kind of awkward that Dora kind of turns to the camera and goes like, "Well, kids, what do you think?" Right. Blank stare and I'm like... You assume that they respond. You pilot it, but you can't really track something like that. We're actually telling kids, "No, you need to respond and we'll know it." Right? You're actually speaking to the character I think that I have to say, Amit, one of the things that I have to mention here, because I think, you know, on one hand creating content that is interactive and is producing the same effect and it's incredible. But building an infrastructure that allows others to come and modify that content to fit their own specific needs, right, every school wants to tell their story a little bit different. Every place that needs to teach about how to deal with an earthquake needs to learn a little bit of a different situation, different communication, you know. We're looking at a globalized world. We're still a million different cultures. You know, even within the US, we have different cultures and different ways of communication. And having a team of the animators, building one product with one communication that targets all, it just doesn't work, especially not for kids. And I think that what you're doing with PopBase beyond the actual, you know, messaging of one game, but actually building the infrastructure that allows other creators to go and modify that, I think that's really the innovative part here that I as a technologist and as a startup enthusiast, I'm really excited about. Yeah. Thank you. And the interesting thing is the way that we're thinking about it, and again, we'll see where the market actually takes us. But right now, the way that we're launching is that we're launching our own original IP. Because once again, we're doing this kind of great value, and we get to gather our own team of experts to say, we have a show runner, an actual Hollywood show runner. Like he's going to help us dictate the content. He's not going to rely on their knowledge. But like you said, he's going to work with schools, he's going to work with hospitals and essentially tell them like, "A segment of our audience, we want to give them this information. Can we give this just to?" Absolutely. This system allows you to do that. It allows you to also distribute it publicly. Now, what it also allows to do, and that's what we're really hoping, because that's the, let's say, Woodland Mystery is the product that we're launching on the system as you know, it's a railway system. And this is the first product we've kind of tossing on it because, again, area full of white space, it's a good way to break into the market. But what we're saying is, okay, on one hand you can have the $100 million business of Woodland Mysterie's does really well. And now, the kids are growing out of it, make your new IP. Right? Make another one for kids five to eight. Make another one so kids grow up. It's great. We will be delighted. That's like having your own proprietary tool that gives you that advantage. The other thing you touched on, that's the multibillion dollar business. Right? And it's something that we're optimizing for, which is the minute you put it out, there are tool, doesn't only solve the communication problem, it's also it's a pipeline tool that comes from, again, thinking of animation. Our founding team comes from, I come from television. My CEO and CTO both come from a long, long history of video game development, on both engineering and the technical art side. And that's where we really combine our thinking with. Like this is how Hollywood handles things and this is how video games handle things. Just as a side note, video game, the video game industry has been so far ahead on so many technologies. And I think now the tech world is starting to catch up to it because they're going like, "Oh, my God, why is this so successful? How are they doing these things?" In terms of R&D, they are so far ahead, you have no idea. Like, I encourage you to look more and more into the video game industry. Because a lot of the tech companies right now that are considered disruptive really seem to them like primitive, at this point. Right? So, when you look at all of these pipelines, we're essentially saying, and this is an interesting piece of information regardless, but when you look at an animation show, like a show like on Cartoon Network on Adult Swim, it takes the network about anywhere between 500 to $700,000 per episode to produce. And it takes a very long time. You think of the length of a season on Netflix, it's like eight episodes per season. The traditional format is more like 11 minutes, 20 episodes per season. And it takes years from when you actually start pre-production to when you edit. And even the production of an episode itself takes months. We essentially built a tool that allows us to distribute the same length like a half hour, fully interactive, fully immersive piece of content in episode with a team of like five to six people in two weeks. So, going back to what this model does, if we put it out there and it gets very quickly validated, our hope is someone like a Disney, like a Cartoon Network, which we have worked with before, looks at this and goes, "Wait a minute, you've done what?" "Can I use that?" Can I essentially use my own intellectual property to communicate my message? It could be purely entertainment, it could be education, but I want to do this. There you go. Here's our API, Here are our developer tools. And here's all the documentation. Now, you have the power to do the same thing. And that's what we're really hoping for and that's what we're optimizing the entire business around. But, you know, it's a journey. Amit, wonderful. And you know, beyond everything, beyond the technology and animation industry, I think that the fact that what you're working on really at the end of the day, it's in the wellness space. And the positive impact it's going to have the butterfly effect that it's going to have is just tremendous. That's what really I'm excited about from the sidelines. But it's a really amazing job. And it's really, really inspiring to get to know these new industries and these new passions. And watching somebody growing up with a certain passion and following it through, both relocating and moving through different journeys, but now working on PopBase for quite some time now and being so passionate about it, honestly, that's one of the most inspiring things here. Before we leave, I have to ask you for the most important question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. Okay. I would say determined, I would say a direct, I would say loud. And you can interpret that in any way you want. I love all of those. Amit, thank you so, so much. Best of luck with PopBase. And I can't wait to see where this thing is going. Thank you. Thank you.
