159
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,600
Irina Meyer, thank you so much

160
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,560
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

161
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,360
Thank you. Thank you very much

162
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,240
for having me. I love your show.

163
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:27,880
Thank you.

164
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,080
You have such a non-linear path

165
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,560
that I can't wait to dive deep

166
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,920
and understand how your values

167
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,600
are progressing you through your

168
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,680
different life decisions.

169
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,480
But, you know, as a brief intro,

170
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,000
which will do no service

171
00:05:41,005 --> 00:05:42,360
to the incredible things you've done.

172
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,640
First of all, you're an Emmy Award winner.

173
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,880
Let's put that out there.

174
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,440
I can't wait to hear what that's about.

175
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,720
But you actually started,

176
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,720
or you didn't start

177
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,840
you progressed through,

178
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,120
financial institutions

179
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,080
like Bank of America.

180
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,040
You're a huge investor in

181
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,600
I think, international investor

182
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,640
because you speak six languages.

183
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,360
I have to understand what that's about.

184
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,200
Irina, talk to me.

185
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,360
Who are you?

186
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,080
How do you do all this stuff?

187
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,120
I don't know.

188
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,480
I just do things which the most normal,

189
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,120
the most natural for me.

190
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,960
Which means

191
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,040
I always do the thing that

192
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,440
I feel is the right thing.

193
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,640
I walk away from the people

194
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,680
who are wrong people,

195
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,920
and I think that's very important.

196
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,360
And I follow the passion that I have.

197
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,080
And I always, at any point in time,

198
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,000
make sure that I give back.

199
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,480
So any time I fail and

200
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,440
or I'm a bad situation,

201
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,400
I push forward.

202
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,040
Any time I win, I have to pause

203
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,320
and make sure that

204
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,520
I share my success with other people

205
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,200
who also need a break.

206
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,200
So that's kind of how I roll.

207
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,440
And also, I learn all the time.

208
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,960
I never stop learning.

209
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,720
I love it. I just love it. Okay.

210
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,480
So, talk to me, how do you start

211
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,160
from a place like Bank of America

212
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,640
and then move on to a place like ABC?

213
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,520
Motion pictures? Win an Emmy?

214
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,840
What's it about?

215
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,800
So, I was working

216
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,240
and indeed in the technology group,

217
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,520
I was at the Bank of America

218
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,280
and it's actually in the beginning

219
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,000
was countrywide.

220
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,320
And I was working doing the

221
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,120
technical risk assessments

222
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,600
for their central group

223
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,080
which means for their headquarters.

224
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,800
All their projects of the value

225
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,240
above $20 million of business impact

226
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,560
will go for me.

227
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,920
Then when 2008 happened,

228
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,400
and I just was seeing what was

229
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,200
unfolding with the countrywide

230
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,320
that no matter how good

231
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,480
the two hundred people

232
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,640
around me were,

233
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,360
that the company was deeply corrupt

234
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,320
and created such an incredibly

235
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,160
devastating trickle effect

236
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,280
of contributing to it in the country.

237
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,840
And even though I just was promoted

238
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,160
four months prior to AVP,

239
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,360
I walked away

240
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,680
because I never wanted,

241
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,920
and I didn't have another job lined up,

242
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,040
because they just

243
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,360
I knew that was not right.

244
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,600
And that was me walking away

245
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,720
from the wrong people,

246
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,200
and I didn't want to create

247
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,720
any kind of explanation for myself

248
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,080
why I should stay.

249
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,240
So Irina on that note.

250
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,020
So, you mentioned right at the offset

251
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,280
that you're guided by your values

252
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,000
and that guides your non traditional

253
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,200
non-linear path.

254
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,160
What are these core values

255
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,560
that you are addressing here?

256
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,640
Absolutely.

257
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,160
So, you need to make sure that your work

258
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,600
being contributed to something good.

259
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,440
Greater good.

260
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,760
You do not give away your work

261
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,120
for something which is meaningless

262
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,720
or have some kind of short term

263
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,520
pragmatic effect.

264
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,200
It's just not for me.

265
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,680
Whenever I work,

266
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,280
it's really need to be

267
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,520
to make better the social environment.

268
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,960
It needs to be towards the creativity.

269
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,080
It needs to be for the better

270
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,560
of the of the people.

271
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,800
If it does not go there,

272
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,680
it just, it stops for me.

273
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,800
And I know that I have quite

274
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,240
significant success,

275
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,760
and I have my personal capital fund

276
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,240
that I run and it's international,

277
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,000
but I never followed what will be my

278
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,720
short term or even

279
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,760
mid-term financial gain

280
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
because money is gonna follow you

281
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,600
when you're doing the right thing

282
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,680
and you'll work with the right people.

283
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,680
And it doesn't have to be immediate.

284
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,080
But it always will.

285
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,520
That's my experience.

286
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,600
Inspiring. Okay.

287
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,120
So, moving on to digital media

288
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,920
and television.

289
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,360
What is this industry that I,

290
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,640
I don't know anything about it.

291
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,960
So, you go.

292
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,760
What does it mean even digital media

293
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,960
and making those innovations over there?

294
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,640
Of course. So, digital media progresses.

295
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,560
So what is it today in 2020

296
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,560
is very different when what it was in 2010

297
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,040
So, when I was there, digital media

298
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,120
it is the way to for the people

299
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,400
to connect with whatever they love.

300
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,400
So it doesn't have to be

301
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,400
for the network television.

302
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,400
I was working for ABC,

303
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,600
but only digital media.

304
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,160
That's me.

305
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,080
That whenever there were Oscars,

306
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,640
and I was running Oscar's production

307
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,640
for there three years,

308
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,840
is to bring the experience to the people.

309
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,560
Not make it,

310
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,360
not live it as an elite.

311
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,240
You know, you just there

312
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,560
in on some kind of magazine cover

313
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,880
Angelina Jolie and you have no relation.

314
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,880
You create those bridges.

315
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,400
You connect it via your laptop,

316
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,200
your computer,

317
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,840
and many of the IOS devices,

318
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,640
Androids.

319
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,080
So you bring that to people.

320
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,800
How to make that relevant to you?

321
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,760
And every time and every day

322
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,800
of working in digital media,

323
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,240
that's what we were doing.

324
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,800
... about Oscars.

325
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,280
Make sure you are there.

326
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,120
That means that the cameras

327
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,520
that I would supervise

328
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,040
to put in, they ...

329
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,160
every person from millions

330
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,460
connecting to the livestream.

331
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,280
They had an impression that

332
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,280
they can move it at any point.

333
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,720
And they can be there

334
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,400
and watch what people do

335
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,440
during their stars,

336
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,120
during the commercial breaks.

337
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,840
And bring it home.

338
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,760
And that is really fascinating

339
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,280
because that's what we want.

340
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,240
We do not want to just

341
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,560
be on the outskirts.

342
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,080
We want to be part of this show.

343
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,840
And that's what the digital will do.

344
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,360
So, what are some of the challenges

345
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,040
that you faced as you were trying

346
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,360
to innovate this concept?

347
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,560
So, what does that even mean

348
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,080
for me to sit at home

349
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,720
and be present at the Oscars?

350
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:06,600
For example, you are invited.

351
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,960
That's the thing.

352
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,760
You receive the golden envelope.

353
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,680
You're invited.

354
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,800
You can choose to go and see

355
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,120
where the stars take champagne.

356
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,600
You can decide what dress a trophy girl,

357
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,400
I am not being obnoxious

358
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:22,960
it's ... usual name

359
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,480
called trophy girl.

360
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,680
The girl who brings the

361
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
who brings the Oscar.

362
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,160
That's the position.

363
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,120
What will she be wearing?

364
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,800
And that will be competition

365
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,680
among 10 different upcoming

366
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,680
totally unknown designers.
- Unbelievable

367
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,560
And people can be present

368
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,560
at the catwalk which will be

369
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,040
done before.

370
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,600
And the winner will be announced

371
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,160
during this time.

372
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,280
That means that on the red carpet,

373
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,520
there will be ... digital media hosts.

374
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,360
By the way, we had our booth

375
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,720
right next to Oprah's.

376
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,400
And then where we will be talking

377
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,160
for our fans, for our viewers

378
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,720
from home.

379
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,120
Not necessarily just bringing

380
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,920
more people to the ABC channel

381
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,840
so that the ABC channel

382
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,080
will sell more ads.

383
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,680
It's for the people who can just

384
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,160
log on their phone and

385
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,200
or on their tablet

386
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,320
and just be there.

387
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,320
And their questions will be answered.

388
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,080
Amazing. But that's radically different

389
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,040
from being an investor.

390
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,320
You're investing in early stage startups

391
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,840
yet here you are being a creative.

392
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,000
You're running creativity to how

393
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,000
to integrate the at home experience

394
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,640
with something as amazing as the Oscars.

395
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,360
And by the way, you got the Emmy in 2011,

396
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,480
and what was that for?

397
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,040
For innovation and digital media?

398
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,760
Yes, it was outstanding achievement

399
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,040
in interactive media.

400
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,240
And that was, the product was

401
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,080
Oscars digital experience.

402
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,840
So, that's the whole package that we did

403
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,960
and that we were unfolding

404
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,640
for the five months prior to the show.

405
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,280
We recorded,

406
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,240
we created for television shows,

407
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,480
for web presence. We did

408
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,120
meetings with the stars.

409
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,840
With the nominated stars.

410
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,880
There were designer contests.

411
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,280
There was sweepstakes.

412
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,680
There were many things prior to the event.

413
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,400
So, the whole package of it

414
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,240
was Oscars digital experience.

415
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:35,520
And we rolled it out on IOS only

416
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,280
it was barely eight months

417
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,720
after iPod was out.

418
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,400
And it took I believe three years

419
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,680
until something similar

420
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,640
were rolled out by somebody else

421
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,440
which was MTV later on.

422
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,840
So, yeah, it was actually a big deal

423
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,260
from technological perspective.

424
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,120
I worked with over 20 different

425
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,800
contractors in addition to over 15

426
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,640
of different internal groups for ABC

427
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,840
and the infrastructure groups at Disney

428
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,840
which is a parent company of ABC.

429
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,600
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

430
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,000
Okay. Let's move on

431
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,360
to your two investments.

432
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,760
You're running an early stage fund.

433
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,440
You're investing internationally,

434
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,720
which is unique in its own way

435
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,000
because most venture capital funds,

436
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,000
especially early stage, they're focused

437
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,760
on a certain geographical region.

438
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,840
Yet you're branching out.

439
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,440
And is that because

440
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,640
you speak six languages?

441
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,840
Is that a part of it?

442
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,400
No, I'm not sure

443
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,760
because I learn languages

444
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,400
for years before they eventually

445
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,840
become useful.

446
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,240
Because it is.

447
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,400
So, it helps when it comes.

448
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,120
But I am once again,

449
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,480
I avoid this pragmatic effect.

450
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,080
Why don't I learn German

451
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,160
so I can invest in Switzerland?

452
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,960
It happens in a similar way.

453
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,040
Or why do I learn Mandarin Chinese

454
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,800
for the last 10 years

455
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,040
and it's only a year ago when I became

456
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,920
a board member for a company

457
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,920
which is doing development in China.

458
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,560
So it comes eventually together

459
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,320
but it's not because of that.

460
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,440
And I agree with you

461
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,880
this is not conventional.

462
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,960
I'm the only person in my company.

463
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,880
The fund is my personal.

464
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,760
I don't have any LPs.

465
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,440
And for an individual,

466
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,600
a one woman operation to say,

467
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,400
you know US is not enough.

468
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,760
I made only last year

469
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,800
six investments in Israel.

470
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,760
And I invested in a Swiss company

471
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,200
and I'm planning to do more.

472
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
I'm a member of two groups

473
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,800
in Zurich and in Zug.

474
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,920
And yeah, it is,

475
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,640
but there is a method to the madness.

476
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,160
I am not just being

477
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,200
trying to overextend myself.

478
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,880
I plan specifically.

479
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,960
Let's say when I go to Israel.

480
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,080
I have a plan.

481
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:07,840
What is it?

482
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,720
What type of company interests me?

483
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,400
What type of innovation?

484
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,160
What groups I need to work?

485
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,640
I know what proportion of my portfolio

486
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,920
I want to be dedicated

487
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,600
to this specific area

488
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,160
which is med device

489
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,000
life science in Israel

490
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,680
which I find absolutely extraordinary.

491
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,800
And that I wanted to be

492
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,240
within about 25 to 30 to 33%

493
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,880
of my portfolio.

494
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,280
And I just work diligently

495
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,640
for a very long time

496
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,080
before I trigger my investments,

497
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,600
but whenever they are ready,

498
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,560
I'm very decisive

499
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,280
and I'm just going

500
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,360
and I'm executing it.

501
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,760
Same thing that I would do

502
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,560
in Switzerland.

503
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,640
And recently I invested even

504
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,520
in a company out of

505
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,480
Sofia, Bulgaria.

506
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,000
My very first east

507
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,960
European company.

508
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,280
How did you even find these companies

509
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
because the deal flow is its own struggle.

510
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,880
There's so many early stage VCs

511
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,280
around the world now.

512
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,480
I don't know how many there are

513
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,240
in Eastern Europe,

514
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,280
but around the world and Israel

515
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,120
and the US of course, there is a lot.

516
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,320
So how do you go and find those deals

517
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,000
so that when you want to be decisive

518
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,160
and execute, you actually have

519
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,800
access to the best deals?

520
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,880
So that is an absolutely

521
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,840
wonderful question.

522
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,080
And that is the biggest issue

523
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,160
I think that exists with private investors

524
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,760
is the access to the deal flow

525
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,720
and be able to see through it correctly.

526
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,960
And I've been very fortunate in the fact

527
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,680
that I've been able to create

528
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,640
an extraordinary network.

529
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,760
And because I'm never afraid

530
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,800
to walk away from something

531
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,120
that doesn't work or

532
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,800
being very outspoken

533
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,440
when something is subpar,

534
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,320
that I have really wonderful collaborators.

535
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,120
And I spend huge amount of my time,

536
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,720
perhaps over 80% of my time,

537
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,880
doing pro bono work

538
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,000
for other investors.

539
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,920
When I do that,

540
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,000
and I do not ask for any,

541
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,200
and that goes back to my core values.

542
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,320
And I do not ask for shares

543
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,720
or payment of any kind.

544
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,320
I will get back the most interesting deals

545
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,080
these people will be working on.

546
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,600
And they will be sharing it with me

547
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,040
that they might be even reluctant

548
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,360
to do with somebody else.

549
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,840
And it's not only with private individuals.

550
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,760
VCs, like partners in VC Firms,

551
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,440
will reach out to me and say,

552
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
"Hey Irina, I came across that.

553
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,600
Our fund is investing and

554
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,400
would you like to have

555
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,840
some space in the round?"

556
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,200
And that I think is -

557
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,000
It's all about relationships.

558
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,580
- greater for me versus many other

559
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,940
private investors in the space.

560
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,570
I'm very lucky in this way.

561
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,440
So it's all about the relationships

562
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,400
and it sounds like, again,

563
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,200
the pro bono work that you're doing,

564
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,720
and all these different experiences,

565
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,880
and the values that you're exuding

566
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,840
they're not about getting

567
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,800
something in the short term.

568
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,160
You think, you're saying I'm

569
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,800
operating my life in the long term,

570
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,960
and if I'm kind

571
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,440
and if I'm helpful to others now,

572
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,200
I'm not expecting anything in return.

573
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,200
But you know,

574
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,360
accumulatively over years,

575
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,720
these relationships go both ways.

576
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,800
And it's not just that they're helping me,

577
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,920
they want me to be in a partnership

578
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,520
with them because they know

579
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,920
that my values are true and honest.

580
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,000
Yeah. And oftentimes

581
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,120
it doesn't come through,

582
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,840
and I'm completely okay with that.

583
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,640
Sometimes people just consume

584
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,720
the piece of work I've done

585
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,000
and then that's it.

586
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,920
And you know what?

587
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,080
I never have hard feelings about it

588
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,840
because I know that I'm

589
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,040
doing the right thing.

590
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,080
And that is it.

591
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,960
And the access to the most interesting,

592
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,920
innovative company,

593
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,360
to the COOs who need mentorship.

594
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,160
Who need help.

595
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,600
Who need introduction.

596
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,600
And it's everything

597
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,840
that I do is collaborative.

598
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,360
Every single thing.

599
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,440
I never just find a gem and says,

600
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,720
"Okay. That is just for me.

601
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,480
I hope nobody hears about it.

602
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,880
I don't want to do any work

603
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,720
for them because it would be free."

604
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,560
No, I will tell about it and I will help.

605
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,960
Sometimes I do work for the C

606
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,780
for the company,

607
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,760
employees, CEO, for years

608
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,560
without even being an official adviser

609
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,840
because that is how I can help

610
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,680
my companies to gain value and to come

611
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,560
to the next level of financing.

612
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,120
Reaching the new audience that

613
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,840
I am not a passive investor.

614
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,600
And I think it's also,

615
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,600
it helps me to get much better results

616
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,600
than probably on average in the space.

617
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,200
Amazing.

618
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,520
Irina, what is it about languages

619
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,760
that you love so much?

620
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,640
How do you get to learn six languages?

621
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,440
And what are those six, by the way?

622
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,600
Well, my mother language,

623
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,400
my mother tongue is Russian.

624
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,360
And then obviously it's English.

625
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,640
French. I was in Paris for a year,

626
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,400
and I learned French literature

627
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,840
and French language in Paris.

628
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:11,000
And then I speak German.

629
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,640
And that is my most recent language.

630
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,760
I started learning Chinese

631
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,280
back in 2006 or so.

632
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,160
I am quite fluent in Mandarin.

633
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,440
I speak Spanish fluently,

634
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,440
which definitely helps.

635
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,080
And I don't know, maybe I missed

636
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,640
something but -

637
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,400
Well next one needs to be Hebrew

638
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,000
of course.

639
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,320
Of course.

640
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,800
But I love it

641
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,280
because it breaks the barriers

642
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,080
between me and other people

643
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,200
and other cultures,

644
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,520
and it makes my life richer

645
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,880
because I can read,

646
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,160
I can watch TV in whatever language,

647
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,880
I can travel and I can talk to people

648
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,520
and I am very people oriented.

649
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,880
And I feel like my world is brighter

650
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,640
and bigger and happier

651
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,200
and than it would be otherwise.

652
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:05,880
I love it.

653
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,000
Irina, what is the one thing

654
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
you're most passionate about?

655
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,720
What gets you so excited

656
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,400
every single morning when you

657
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,160
wake up about the work that you do?

658
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,640
About the work that I do?

659
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:20,120
Yes, it is I feel like an individual

660
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,040
have an opportunity to make a

661
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,720
huge effect on the society at large,

662
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,800
and I'm not talking about

663
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,320
one country's society.

664
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,760
It is we, I feel like I can

665
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,400
I am making a difference.

666
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,600
Whether it is from my volunteering work

667
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,120
for the Amy Foundation.

668
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,600
Or whether it is by mentoring somebody

669
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:48,200
who brings a new way of popularizing

670
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,800
something that was used to be

671
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,280
available only to elite.

672
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,280
Who bring in the medication,

673
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,720
the new molecules

674
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,440
that is gonna save lives

675
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,960
and prevent suffering.

676
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,840
From women suffering

677
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,920
from breast cancers,

678
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,800
from early diagnosis of the oral cancers.

679
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,200
And it also make difference for the life

680
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,080
of individual entrepreneurs who strive

681
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,720
with their dreams or

682
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,760
in their creative side,

683
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,960
well everything is creative,

684
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,880
but in the television arts

685
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,240
for the young people

686
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,920
out of Alabama

687
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,040
Mississippi

688
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,120
who want to be producers in Hollywood.

689
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,280
You want to give them that chance.

690
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,960
And when you can,

691
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,960
by finding for them an internship

692
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,160
in with one of the studios,

693
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,480
you feel like that day was a good day.

694
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,120
And it's just for them.

695
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,600
It's all been nothing for me.

696
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,320
But it feels more than anything else

697
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,080
that I can receive in the form

698
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,920
of payments, talk or something else.

699
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,320
Irina, inspiring, inspiring.

700
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,520
Right before we leave,

701
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,640
I can't believe 20 minutes are already up.

702
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,160
I need three words that best describe you.

703
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,920
And I want to thank you for really

704
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,720
the generous time,

705
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,280
that you've given me here.

706
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,440
So, that is a good question.

707
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,520
So, number one will be decisive.

708
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,440
So, I am capable of making decisions.

709
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,640
So, that would be definitely.

710
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:12,650
Passionate.

711
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,040
Passionate will be the second one

712
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,040
cause if I'm not passionate,

713
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,360
I just don't do it.

714
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,280
And the third would be

715
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,600
I don't know why, but that's what people

716
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,200
seem to differentiate me from others.

717
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,320
I know no fear.

718
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,800
So I'm absolutely fearless.

719
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,880
There is no such a thing

720
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,960
that somebody can scare me.

721
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,440
It just doesn't work.

722
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,680
Decisive. Passionate. Fearless.

723
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,880
Irina, toda raba.

724
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,920
Thank you very, very much.

725
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,840
We didn't even talk about J-Ventures

726
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,000
and how I love collaborating there

727
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,960
but we'll leave that for another time.

728
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Thank you for everything.

729
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,760
Really inspiring. Just thank you.

730
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,320
Thank you. Thank you very, very much.

731
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,120
And I hope to collaborate sometime

732
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,680
soon with perhaps my own venture.

733
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,440
Would love to. Please think of me

734
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,800
when you're building something new.

735
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,280
Thank you. Take care.

736
00:25:59,480 --> 00:25:59,920
Bye bye.
