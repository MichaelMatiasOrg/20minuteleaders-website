1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,120
So, I think as a woman

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:01,680
in the workplace,

3
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,560
as a young woman,

4
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,880
I had to almost like pretend

5
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,840
to not be a woman

6
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,800
and not be feminine

7
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,040
and just ignore that identity.

8
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,640
And so, all of a sudden,

9
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,040
I was like at a concert

10
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,200
and I just like had somatic experiences.

11
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,200
I was like, oh, I'm feeling

12
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,160
the music in my body.

13
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,480
I was like, there's information here,

14
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,437
there's a gut feeling.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,040
Carine Carmy,

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,320
welcome to 20 Minute Leaders.

17
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,040
How are you today?

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,280
Amazing.

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,200
Thank you so much for having me.

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,320
It's a pleasure.

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,840
No, no, the honor is mine

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,040
and the pleasure is mine,

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,640
because I'm always excited

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,320
to dive into a whole new industry

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,280
and a whole new market

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,480
that I know absolutely nothing about

27
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,440
but I want to know more about.

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,453
Before we dive into

29
00:01:04,454 --> 00:01:05,760
what you're doing with Origin,

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,880
I'd love to go back a little bit

31
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,880
through UPenn researcher,

32
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,400
and you're getting

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,840
your bachelor's degree there.

34
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,680
And you go on to do all sorts

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,560
of interesting stuff,

36
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,560
whether it's with 3D printing

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,880
or being a VP at Shapeways,

38
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,400
instructor at General Assembly,

39
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,680
VP Sales at Amino,

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,320
all sorts of different weird things.

41
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,160
Take me a little bit through

42
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,320
your journey up until origin.

43
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,840
Yeah. I'm happy too.

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,320
And you know, I think

45
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,560
the common thread is just like

46
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,680
follow your curiosity, right,

47
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,800
because you never know where

48
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,960
the world is going to take you.

49
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,200
I grew up in LA

50
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,320
and I went to school

51
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,720
on the East Coast at Penn undergrad.

52
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,040
And it was a really actually,

53
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,560
amazing experience.

54
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,240
I loved it there.

55
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,080
And I thought I was going

56
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,800
to be a journalist.

57
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,080
And then after a lot of pressure

58
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,320
from family and also

59
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,640
you know, kind of seeing

60
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,120
the business side,

61
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,600
I was like, okay,

62
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,040
this is actually very compelling.

63
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,360
So, started the econ

64
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,618
and I graduated actually

65
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,560
into the 2008 recession.

66
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,120
So, that was something special.

67
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,200
And I definitely feel for everyone

68
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,960
who's graduating this year.

69
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,751
And with covid,

70
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,440
I know it's crazy, crazy times.

71
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,920
But I was lucky enough

72
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,000
to be able to get a job

73
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,360
in management consulting.

74
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,440
And this was 2008.

75
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,920
Like the week before I joined

76
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,508
they let us know that

77
00:02:17,509 --> 00:02:19,480
they had let go 20% of the firm.

78
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,520
So, I'm kind of like holding on

79
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,440
to my chair, like,

80
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,080
what is this world going to be.

81
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,360
And it was just an amazing boot camp.

82
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,840
You know, I think there's various ways

83
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,800
you can start your career.

84
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
I just feel really grateful

85
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
to be in a position

86
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,680
where my job literally, everyday,

87
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,120
was learn as much as I can

88
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,280
as quickly as possible

89
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,760
and provide the best advice

90
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,480
we can using data and analytics.

91
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,000
And it was a good boot camp.

92
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,480
But about a few years in,

93
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,720
I started really developing my passion

94
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,320
for technology and digital media.

95
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,000
And I actually remember

96
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,640
I saw this one video

97
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,240
that came out of the MIT Media Lab

98
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,560
and it was called The Sixth Sense,

99
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,520
and it was the early days of AR/VR.

100
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,040
And I was like,

101
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,920
this is the coolest thing

102
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,440
I've ever seen.

103
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,800
I have to work in tech.

104
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,880
And I don't have any skills

105
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,840
but I got to work in this industry.

106
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,255
And we had a digital media

107
00:03:07,256 --> 00:03:09,320
kind of consulting arm of monitor

108
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,360
called Marketspace,

109
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,520
and they were actually spinning out

110
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,875
the practice into its all

111
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:15,120
like kinds of digital consulting studio.

112
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,160
And so, I kind of just knocked

113
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,800
on their doors.

114
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,440
It was three partners.

115
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:17,960
I was like, you've got

116
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,640
to take me with you. I'm coming.

117
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,040
So, we started

118
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,080
a boutique digital media firm

119
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,360
called MarketspaceNext for few years.

120
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
And it was amazing.

121
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,000
So, I went from like 50,000 feet

122
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,680
to 10,000 feet and we did everything

123
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,360
from go to market strategies

124
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
and UX design,

125
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,480
and you just kind of

126
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,520
make it up as we go along.

127
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,960
But it was a great learning experience.

128
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,200
And both of my parents

129
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,080
are small business owners.

130
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,053
So, I always thought about

131
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:44,640
kind of doing the startup thing.

132
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,280
And New York at the time,

133
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,960
like the New York tech scene,

134
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,560
was maybe 10,000 people,

135
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,880
it was really small in 2009.

136
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,360
The tech meet up was like

137
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,320
the literal event

138
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,840
that everyone would go to.

139
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,600
And so, I just started applying to jobs.

140
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,520
And it took me about a year and a half

141
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,320
to actually get someone to believe in me,

142
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,000
that this person who

143
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,920
had no real operational skills.

144
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,920
I basically, this is like the pro tip,

145
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,960
I wrote a blog post about 3D printing

146
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,640
because I thought it was

147
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,000
a really interesting category.

148
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,600
And then I sent it to the CEO

149
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,480
of the company Shapeways,

150
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,000
which is hiring

151
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
for a head of marketing.

152
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,560
And I was like, you know

153
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,000
I know it doesn't look like it on paper,

154
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,120
but like, just take me.

155
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,680
I promise you,

156
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,360
it's not going to be a bad thing.

157
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,170
And it was really

158
00:04:28,171 --> 00:04:29,640
one of the best career moves

159
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,760
I was able to make.

160
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,640
We were really small at the time.

161
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,600
This is when 3D printing

162
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,520
was just taking off.

163
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,200
And I got to join

164
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,440
the team really early days

165
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,760
and help hope like,

166
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,960
just build this category.

167
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,840
And it was so fun

168
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,040
because 3D printing is much bigger now.

169
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,200
But at the time

170
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,080
it was all of these like,

171
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,416
really passionate designers

172
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:47,682
all around the world

173
00:04:47,683 --> 00:04:49,041
making products in ways that

174
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:50,720
they've never been able to do before.

175
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,600
So, it felt like we were really

176
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,760
democratizing, manufacturing

177
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,000
and creation.

178
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,120
And I learned a lot.

179
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,440
I made a lot of mistakes.

180
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,440
I definitely had my first office cry

181
00:04:59,440 --> 00:04:59,840
where I was like,

182
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,760
I don't know how to do it,

183
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:01,640
you know, what does this mean.

184
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,360
Like, I can't learn all

185
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,840
of this like today.

186
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,720
But it was an amazing experience.

187
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,000
And I got to go from first marketer,

188
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,280
to leading our marketing team,

189
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,800
and that over time building out

190
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,760
our marketing community,

191
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,920
e-commerce teams.

192
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,880
And you know, I felt really lucky

193
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,440
to have people believe in me, too,

194
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,640
because there's hard work.

195
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,520
But you also have to have

196
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,400
the right leadership

197
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,760
to kind of seize them.

198
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,760
So, that was a good boot camp,

199
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,880
made a lot of mistakes,

200
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,720
but it was really fun.

201
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,800
And then, I was thinking

202
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,880
about moving to California,

203
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,000
kind of the pull from home kept pulling.

204
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,200
And I had always been interested

205
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,760
in health care.

206
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,520
And we had done a lot

207
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,240
of health care work

208
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,760
at Monitor and at Marketspace.

209
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,440
And this was when digital health

210
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,353
has kind of started to grow as a category

211
00:05:45,354 --> 00:05:46,840
and we start to see more innovative

212
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,800
direct to consumer

213
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,320
and just innovative models

214
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,120
on how we improve

215
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,520
the health care system.

216
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,400
And I decided to stop being skeptical

217
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,040
and believe that

218
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
you could change healthcare.

219
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,280
And so, I joined an amazing founder,

220
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,600
David Vivero, at a company called Amino,

221
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,440
which is now one of the leading providers

222
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,720
of kind of navigating

223
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,600
the health care system

224
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,720
and financial wellness

225
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,040
around health care.

226
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,840
Because like today, it's still

227
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,840
I mean, you know, this, you know,

228
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,440
with health care in the US,

229
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,600
it's crazy.

230
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,680
Most people can't even afford

231
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,840
a $500 surprise medical bill.

232
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,320
And the difference between walking

233
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,560
to like urgent care in ER

234
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,680
is just insane.

235
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,440
And there's no price transparency.

236
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,720
There's no quality transparency.

237
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,080
So, we're really trying to tackle that.

238
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,840
And go ahead.

239
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,440
We're you going to say something?

240
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,440
I keep going back to this experience.

241
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,880
It was my first week at Stanford.

242
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,720
One of the economics professors

243
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,640
that I had, was talking about

244
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,520
the fact that most Americans can't pay

245
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,920
a $400 bill if their car breaks down

246
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,440
in the middle of the street.

247
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,000
Which to me, it was unbelievable.

248
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,560
It was unfathomable to imagine

249
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,440
that the majority of the of US families

250
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,240
can't afford a $400 emergency.

251
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,680
And what does that mean about

252
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,000
a broken financial system where,

253
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,400
you know, there's

254
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,560
a consumer spending on one hand,

255
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,520
but lack of information and understanding

256
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,680
about rational decision making.

257
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,080
But sorry, that's my digression.

258
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,440
Go ahead.

259
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,400
No.

260
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,000
Look, I'm with you.

261
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,440
And we can have

262
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,200
a whole conversation around equity

263
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,880
in this country.

264
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,320
And I think that's been,

265
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,400
for me, one of the biggest,

266
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,320
kind of pull points,

267
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,280
because at Amino

268
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,240
and even with Shapeways, it's like,

269
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,120
you shouldn't have

270
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,400
this asymmetric either power information

271
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,240
or even financial tools.

272
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,640
And even the same is true

273
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,160
in women's health.

274
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,360
But that reality of just

275
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,600
how deeply uneducated most Americans,

276
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,080
myself included, are about

277
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,040
how health care works,

278
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,440
like what is the deductible.

279
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,840
It's we're kind of hiding

280
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,800
or the system hides behind

281
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,560
these complicated words and systems.

282
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,120
But it truly has

283
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,680
a major impact on the livelihood

284
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,600
of individuals

285
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,080
and that impacts their work.

286
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,960
And you see it now in covid,

287
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,120
so,] many people are afraid

288
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,920
of losing their jobs,

289
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,240
not just because of losing their jobs,

290
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,120
but losing health care.

291
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,040
And so, this whole system

292
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,600
fundamentally needs to change.

293
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,360
But politics aside,

294
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,120
we were able to grow

295
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,840
the team in the business a lot.

296
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,307
And ultimately we pivoted

297
00:08:03,308 --> 00:08:07,320
from a direct consumer company to B2B.

298
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,400
And that's when I helped build out

299
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,160
our sales team

300
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,160
and kind of customer success.

301
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,560
And as you could probably tell

302
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
throughout my career, I was like,

303
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,160
I want to do more.

304
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,920
I want to learn more.

305
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,331
And like, I really love

306
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:18,200
seeing all aspects of the business.

307
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,280
Like I love marketing.

308
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,520
But for me that was just the entry point.

309
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,960
And so, I'll never forget

310
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,160
a few years into Amino,

311
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,960
the founder, David, took me to lunch.

312
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,720
And he's like, "Carine, have you ever

313
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,080
thought about being a CEO?"

314
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,447
And I was like, "Honestly, no."

315
00:08:30,448 --> 00:08:32,280
Like I'd never put that on my radar.

316
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,040
And just like that conversation

317
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,480
opened up this possibility for me.

318
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,440
And so, I'm eternally grateful to David.

319
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,720
He's honestly the best person

320
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,360
I've worked with in my career.

321
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,920
And it was that moment where

322
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,640
as we started moving into B2B,

323
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,680
I am not the best

324
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,520
enterprise sales leader

325
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,560
in the country, like the team

326
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,920
and the company needed someone else.

327
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,640
I was living between two cities

328
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,040
and just we all decided it was best

329
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,360
if I transitioned out.

330
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,960
So, I took some time off.

331
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,280
Which was the most terrifying thing

332
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,880
I'd ever done.

333
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,640
But I highly recommend it

334
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,108
to anyone in their kind of like

335
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:02,960
early mid career,

336
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,520
if you don't know.

337
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,200
It's really helpful to get that clarity.

338
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,120
And I started working with a coach

339
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,000
and just did like a lot

340
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,920
of that personal exploration

341
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,040
that I had never stopped to do.

342
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,280
Graduating at 21.

343
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
I was like, go, go, go.

344
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,160
And I was like, wait, who am I.

345
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,360
What do I want to actually

346
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,040
do with my life.

347
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,600
And I think on a personal note,

348
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,520
I felt this like,

349
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,560
Go ahead.

350
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,520
I really want to pause at that break

351
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,760
and defining the time, because

352
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,080
I'm both feeling in myself

353
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,880
that this rush

354
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,080
and this need to embrace

355
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,160
every opportunity possible.

356
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,360
Especially given that if we come

357
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,880
with a place where we do have a privilege

358
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,920
to have those opportunities,

359
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,200
it's very hard for me to sleep

360
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,600
an extra hour if I know that

361
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,480
I could be meeting somebody like you

362
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,960
and have a show like this.

363
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,141
But talk to me a little bit about

364
00:09:50,142 --> 00:09:51,840
this decision to take some time off,

365
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,720
work with the coach,

366
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,120
understand a little bit about yourself.

367
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,880
How old were you?

368
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,520
And what was actually going

369
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,440
on during that time?

370
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,400
Yeah. So, it was 2018.

371
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,280
I'm 34 now.

372
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,080
So, a couple of years ago,

373
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,312
I was like 32 or 31 at the time.

374
00:10:07,313 --> 00:10:09,200
32. Yeah.

375
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,840
I can't do math.

376
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,200
Whatever.

377
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,261
Anyways, early 30's.

378
00:10:14,262 --> 00:10:16,320
And it was terrifying, honestly.

379
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,920
So, I got married.

380
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,760
My husband was in LA,

381
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,400
I was living in San Francisco.

382
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,960
I flew back after the wedding

383
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,240
and I had a breakdown

384
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,640
in shavasana and yoga.

385
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,520
And I was like,

386
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,320
"What the hell am I doing?

387
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,720
What is my life right now?"

388
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,520
You know, and I'm like crying

389
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,560
although, like on the yoga mat,

390
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,760
and the woman's like, "Are you okay?"

391
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,800
I'm like, "I'm fine."

392
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,720
"Can I just go right now?"

393
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,960
And I loved the team at Amino so much.

394
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,160
And I like you orient

395
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,480
your life around companies

396
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,600
when you're in the startup world.

397
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,560
And I think that's amazing.

398
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,720
And I don't regret it.

399
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,520
But I also, I wasn't at that point

400
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,400
the right fit for that role anymore.

401
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,072
And I was like,

402
00:10:54,073 --> 00:10:55,160
"Okay. So, now what?"

403
00:10:55,161 --> 00:10:57,360
And so, I had this moment where I said,

404
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,396
I can either go jump into a new job

405
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:01,080
and like the moneymaking person in me

406
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,920
is like, okay, let's go do that.

407
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,080
But I know that if I had gotten

408
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,040
to that point where I was so misaligned

409
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,560
with myself and my goals,

410
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,880
like whatever I was going to do next,

411
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,200
I was just going to be in the same place

412
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,920
a few years later.

413
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,560
And so, I actually,

414
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,640
I called it like, I needed

415
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,480
a spiritual chiropractor.

416
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,560
I think I just need to just get back

417
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,920
into alignment and figure out who am I

418
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,880
and what do I value

419
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,560
and how do I get my life

420
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,520
to reflect that and not just get

421
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,520
stuck on this pull.

422
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,960
Because I think, especially

423
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,680
in Silicon Valley or these big cities

424
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,360
where there's a lot

425
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,520
of very prominent models of success,

426
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,240
you could just think that

427
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,000
that's what it's supposed

428
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,360
to look like for you.

429
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,440
And I think for a lot of people,

430
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:39,880
it's great.

431
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,720
But let's write our own train.

432
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,840
You know, we don't need to get pulled

433
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,760
by the examples that

434
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,480
have been pulled before us.

435
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,040
So, I spent a lot of money on a coach.

436
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,240
It was like terrifying.

437
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
It was like I'm unemployed

438
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,400
and I'm like spending thousands

439
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,200
of dollars on working

440
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,280
with this person.

441
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,240
Best decision I made in my life.

442
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,400
Like I actually met with her

443
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,440
a couple of weeks ago

444
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,200
around my birthday.

445
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,760
And I was like, can you imagine

446
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,560
like, we were sitting there

447
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,640
with a whiteboard and I was like,

448
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,360
I have no idea.

449
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,760
And now, I'm managing

450
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,960
a 28 person team

451
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,560
like venture funded this whole thing.

452
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,320
I'm like, this is crazy.

453
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,160
And in a space

454
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,400
that's so important to me

455
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,560
but was like not even present

456
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,760
at the time.

457
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:18,600
So, it took a lot of work.

458
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:20,640
And I think for me

459
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,600
it was obviously very much around

460
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,200
like what do I value

461
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,000
and how do I think about

462
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,560
my criteria for what's next.

463
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,200
But it was also about,

464
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,240
actually like the mental health

465
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,000
side of things.

466
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,920
I think what was ultimately happening

467
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,160
was I associated productivity

468
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,800
and doing with success.

469
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,040
And obviously you need to do

470
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,800
to be successful.

471
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,160
But that's not the end state.

472
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,840
And I had to unlearn that in a big way.

473
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,160
So, lots of personal growth.

474
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,360
And I think on also

475
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
a really personal note,

476
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,000
I don't know if this

477
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,360
is particularly true to women,

478
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,200
but it's been a theme on

479
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,680
a lot of conversations I've had

480
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,320
is I was really disassociated

481
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,480
from my body.

482
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,840
I had worked so hard.

483
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,040
Also, I think as a woman

484
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,600
in the workplace,

485
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,480
as a young woman,

486
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,800
I had to almost like pretend

487
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,760
to not be a woman

488
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,720
and not be feminine

489
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,960
and just ignore that identity.

490
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,520
And so, all of a sudden,

491
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,960
I was like at a concert

492
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,080
and I just like had somatic experiences.

493
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,120
I was like, oh, I'm feeling

494
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,080
the music in my body.

495
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,400
I was like, there's information here.

496
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,760
There's a gut feeling.

497
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,320
And I really reconnected

498
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,000
with intuition and gut feeling

499
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,200
and what that meant

500
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,680
from a physical component,

501
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,920
which then kind of,

502
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,160
it was both very personal,

503
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,720
but then got me

504
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,560
so much more connected

505
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
to what I'm doing today

506
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,840
and realizing how many women,

507
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,680
because of external pressures,

508
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,280
have been taught

509
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,480
to normalize pain

510
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,640
or to normalize discomfort.

511
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,680
And so, I was back in LA

512
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,840
and I connected with a friend of mine

513
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,120
from high school

514
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,440
who had just had a baby.

515
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,840
And she was telling me everything

516
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,040
she was going on in her body.

517
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,600
And this happens to everyone.

518
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,080
But like her abs were separated,

519
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,520
her neck and shoulder were killing her.

520
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,320
She was leaking,

521
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
she can't control her bladder.

522
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,680
She's having painful sex.

523
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,920
And this is a woman of privilege

524
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,280
who has some

525
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,200
of the best insurance in the country.

526
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,600
And that was her reality.

527
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,520
And so, we started talking.

528
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,560
She's a friend from high school,

529
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,480
now, my co-founder.

530
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,280
And she basically

531
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,760
googled around desperation

532
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,560
and found a physical therapist

533
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,920
and was dramatically healed.

534
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,960
And we started just talking

535
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,080
and we're like, wait,

536
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,640
this is a standard of care in France.

537
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,720
Like you get PT

538
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,720
when you break your pinky

539
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,760
but not when you deliver

540
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,840
a child through your vagina

541
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,612
or through an invasive C-section.

542
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:22,040
Like ,what's wrong here

543
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,960
and why hasn't this taken off.

544
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,560
And that really kicked off now

545
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,640
the journey that is Origin.

546
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,240
Huh. So, you're discovering

547
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,160
this whole opportunity through

548
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,920
sort of a self discovery experience.

549
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,080
And it starts with connecting

550
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,120
the mind and body,

551
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,520
but it's discovering that

552
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,560
there is this whole,

553
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,360
I don't know if it's a taboo subject

554
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,840
or if it's just, you know,

555
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,440
it's an industry.

556
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,080
How do you identify that

557
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,720
the people aren't working on this?

558
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,800
Because you mentioned,

559
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,000
now that you mention it,

560
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,600
it seems so ridiculous

561
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
that people are getting

562
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,400
physical therapy when anything,

563
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,920
at the slightest discomfort,

564
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,160
but something like childbirth,

565
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,040
which obviously, as a man,

566
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,320
I'll never understand the pain,

567
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,480
but going something

568
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,920
as traumatic to the body as it is,

569
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,400
you don't really get that treatment.

570
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,880
How do you explain that people

571
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,000
aren't trying to solve it

572
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,480
other than perhaps Origin?

573
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,160
You know, I think there's a few things.

574
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,880
So one, there's obviously

575
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,040
a lot of gender bias in medicine.

576
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,280
It's systemic in this country.

577
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,120
So, like until the 90s,

578
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,353
we were using men's bodies to study

579
00:15:25,354 --> 00:15:27,319
issues that only impacted women

580
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,120
or primarily impacted women.

581
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,480
So, you can actually do research

582
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,200
on ovarian cancer in men.

583
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,520
Right?

584
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,200
So, like this is 90s, like 1990s.

585
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,280
So, we have just

586
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,760
this deep systemic gender bias

587
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,920
in medicine that's well documented.

588
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,400
And it extends everything.

589
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,800
It's women are less likely

590
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,400
to have their pain taken seriously.

591
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,160
They're more likely

592
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,920
to have heart attacks being misdiagnosed.

593
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,480
Just end to end, women have had

594
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,720
to become bigger advocates

595
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,400
for their own care.

596
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,120
So, that's just messed up.

597
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,320
But that's the fundamental reality.

598
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,640
I think we also have

599
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,360
what was historically probably stigma

600
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,960
or taboo subjects around

601
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,440
pelvic health or vaginas.

602
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,160
Or like we would just associate

603
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,960
anything pelvic oriented around.

604
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,120
either fertility or sex,

605
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,600
which are things

606
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,760
that are not often talked about

607
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,960
in public discourse,

608
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,360
although that's changing.

609
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,440
And then I think

610
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,880
there's just structural reasons

611
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,920
that hasn't happened before.

612
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,680
So, we're one of the only,

613
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,360
and I can tell you a little bit

614
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,280
of what we do, but,

615
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,600
Please.

616
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,433
Most of the people who do

617
00:16:22,434 --> 00:16:24,320
what we do don't take insurance.

618
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,360
And so, you think

619
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,292
about mainstream access

620
00:16:27,293 --> 00:16:28,840
really has to be affordable

621
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,280
for this to take off.

622
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,400
And at our core,

623
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,160
just to kind of level set.

624
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,480
So, Origin is providing physical therapy

625
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,520
for women and mothers.

626
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,240
And we are treating

627
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,600
these incredibly common

628
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,800
but often overlooked issues

629
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,840
that impact women, often around

630
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,960
pregnancy and postpartum,

631
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,920
but like throughout our lives.

632
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,680
So, whether that's painful sex

633
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,640
or you're an athlete

634
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,720
and you're doing crossfit

635
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,840
and you can't control your bladder,

636
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,480
all the way through menopause

637
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,520
and you're having, you know,

638
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,480
your muscles are weakening

639
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,760
and you need more support.

640
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,865
And PT is actually

641
00:16:56,866 --> 00:16:58,400
the first line treatment

642
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,600
for all of these issues

643
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
that women experience.

644
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,120
But, as we said,

645
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,920
there's some supply side issues,

646
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,200
there's some payor problems

647
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,600
and just the cultural norms.

648
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,480
And I think

649
00:17:09,481 --> 00:17:10,960
what was really interesting for us

650
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,840
is as we started digging

651
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,480
into this early days,

652
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,120
the investors weren't there yet to.

653
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,240
So, investors used to say,

654
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,840
fertility is women's health.

655
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,450
And then we'd be like, okay,

656
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:23,000
but what about everything after fertility.

657
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,621
Like, you know,

658
00:17:23,622 --> 00:17:25,400
you have 50% of the population

659
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,640
experiencing these issues.

660
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,600
And because all of the best companies

661
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,400
at the time were in the fertility space,

662
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,000
that's what the market associated

663
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,160
with women's health.

664
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,520
And that was, you know,

665
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,000
even just two years ago.

666
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,800
Today, I just I can't even tell you,

667
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,560
it's like an explosion of creativity

668
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,680
in women's health right now.

669
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,400
Everything from CPG

670
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,120
and menopause and pregnancy,

671
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,000
it's very different.

672
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,320
But a few years ago,

673
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,640
that wasn't the case.

674
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,440
And it's probably because

675
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,399
there weren't as many women VCs

676
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,131
frankly, who were,

677
00:17:51,132 --> 00:17:53,440
we were pitching to mainly men.

678
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,680
Yeah.

679
00:17:54,681 --> 00:17:55,760
That's interesting.

680
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,960
So, talk to me a little bit more

681
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,680
about how this boom

682
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,600
that you're experiencing.

683
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,080
Because until now it sounded like,

684
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,600
you know, you almost stumbled upon

685
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,480
this new marketing opportunity

686
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,560
that's obviously making

687
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,040
a huge impact on women's lives.

688
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,080
And really, really an important space.

689
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,240
But you're also talking about the fact

690
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,520
that there is an explosion,

691
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
not just that you're working on,

692
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,960
but there's a lot of creativity

693
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,520
in the space

694
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,920
and you're attributing a lot of it

695
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,840
to female in VC positions

696
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,200
where they're also interested

697
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,480
in seeing these types of products.

698
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,800
But is that

699
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,720
the main reason you think?

700
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,320
I don't know if it's the main reason.

701
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,320
But I think it's just like

702
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,560
a perfect storm

703
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,960
that was kind of putting

704
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,520
the blinders on.

705
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,400
And then you also just have

706
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,040
to think about

707
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,880
this cultural cycle that we were in.

708
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,640
So, let's say you gave birth.

709
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,080
And then your body is a wreck.

710
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,560
And then you go

711
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,920
to your doctor six weeks later

712
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,080
as the only touchpoint you have

713
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,720
and then you don't see

714
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,880
your doctor for another year after that.

715
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,720
No one is helping you feel better.

716
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,640
And so, that normalizes pain.

717
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:53,960
Right?

718
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,480
And so, every woman

719
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,520
who's been through that cycle before

720
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,280
is just taught that

721
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,720
that's just the way it is.

722
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,280
There's no real solution.

723
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,800
Like, I'm going to have to pee my pants

724
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,680
for the rest of my life,

725
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,960
or sex is always going to hurt.

726
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,640
This is bullshit. Right?

727
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,280
So, but like, if that's the psychology,

728
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,160
then it's really hard to see and say, oh,

729
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,320
like, there's actually a real solution

730
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,241
without either saying

731
00:19:15,242 --> 00:19:16,320
something was wrong with me

732
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,160
for not finding it

733
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,040
or like what's wrong

734
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,560
with the medical system.

735
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,760
I think people are waking up

736
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,600
to that in a big way.

737
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,800
So, I don't think it's

738
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,920
just VCs, you have Me Too.

739
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,280
You have like so many trends

740
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,000
that have shifted the conversation.

741
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,800
And I think even culturally now,

742
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,920
people are just far more open

743
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,480
on Instagram about

744
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,680
these issues themselves.

745
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,240
So, you're just saying a lot of people

746
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,640
it's almost like an awakening, like,

747
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,560
no, I'm not going to live

748
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,440
with this anymore.

749
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,440
And we have so many patients

750
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,440
who are coming in

751
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,000
and it's just really intergenerational.

752
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,200
Like, someone is coming in,

753
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,080
maybe postpartum

754
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,680
and they're bringing

755
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,800
their younger sister,

756
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,680
this is truly happening,

757
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,680
they're bringing their younger sister

758
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,720
who's an athlete, and their mom

759
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,640
who's going through menopause.

760
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,640
It's like, no, none of us

761
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,200
are going to go through

762
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,093
this shit anymore.

763
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,999
Because like, why would we.

764
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,520
I love that. I love that.

765
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,200
It's a revolution.

766
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,040
Yeah.

767
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,040
It really sounds like that.

768
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,160
What are some tips that you can think of

769
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,840
in retrospect about identifying

770
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,520
interesting market opportunities

771
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,200
in, you know, these hidden markets

772
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,440
that perhaps that today

773
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,960
we are not comfortable talking about

774
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,240
or they're just underserved in general?

775
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,440
Yeah.

776
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,520
You know, I wish there was like,

777
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,400
here's the formula

778
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,120
for finding new markets.

779
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,320
I think it does require, obviously,

780
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,160
just having some

781
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,920
of your own intuition expertise.

782
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,120
But I think, you know,

783
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,840
part of it is

784
00:20:35,841 --> 00:20:37,400
I always think about this framework.

785
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,080
There's a lot of people

786
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,560
talk about product market fit,

787
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,880
but I think a lot about

788
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,480
product market capital fit.

789
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,280
So, you have to have both like,

790
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,120
the product that's serving

791
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,760
the right people,

792
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,160
but then also a way to fund that.

793
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,960
And you see a lot of companies

794
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,720
who are like, let's say,

795
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,040
trying to go get VC capital

796
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,712
that are not necessarily

797
00:20:51,713 --> 00:20:52,760
going to scale in that way.

798
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,920
Or, you know,

799
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,840
just the conversation around

800
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,200
how those three have come together,

801
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,960
I think have been missing the mark.

802
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,000
But I would just say

803
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
there's some early signals on

804
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,240
how industries are changing.

805
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,640
So, let's say,

806
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,080
just looking at health care.

807
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,960
Health care 1.0 around digital health

808
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,680
was like, let's do

809
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,000
what was happening in person

810
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,240
and make it like better and digital.

811
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,680
And that was on medical

812
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,960
and all these other companies

813
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,080
who just like brought it up

814
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,160
to the consumer age.

815
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,160
And now it's like,

816
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,360
what is the real product,

817
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,680
digital first solution that's going

818
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,200
to actually be a game changer

819
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,240
for the patient.

820
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,040
And so, I think

821
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,600
you'll probably see similar cycles

822
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,240
in other industries where,

823
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,280
first is just about like,

824
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,480
let's just make it better.

825
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,560
And now it's actually let's make

826
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,400
it new and far more effective

827
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,440
than we could have ever imagined.

828
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,000
I love that.

829
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,520
Carine, thank you so much

830
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,600
for taking the time to do this.

831
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,280
This was inspiring and so interesting.

832
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,520
And it sounds like what you're doing

833
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,080
is really a hugely impactful

834
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,800
and has a positive impact

835
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,560
on so many women.

836
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,320
And I can't wait to see

837
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,560
where Origin Physical Therapy grows

838
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,480
and takes you.

839
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,880
Before we end this,

840
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,280
I want to ask you

841
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,440
the most difficult question,

842
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,360
which is three words

843
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,720
that you would use to describe yourself.

844
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,200
It's always the hard one.

845
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,960
You gave me a little hint

846
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,760
that this is going to happen.

847
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,240
So, I had a minute to think about it.

848
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,440
But I think the three words

849
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,280
would be creative, curious

850
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,040
and unstoppable.

851
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,640
I love that. Yes.

852
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,320
Okay. Finally, I think this was,

853
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,760
this is the first episode

854
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
in about 200 episodes

855
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,880
where somebody said unstoppable.

856
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,800
And I love that word.

857
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,040
I love it.

858
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,160
Yeah. We're just going to go.

859
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,520
I'm so grateful.

860
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,360
Thank you so, so much.

861
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,080
Stay safe. Stay healthy.

862
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,560
And I can't wait

863
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,400
to share this with the world.

864
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:29,800
Thank you.
