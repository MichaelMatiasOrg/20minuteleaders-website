1
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
All right.

2
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,560
Ariel Tseitlin, good morning.

3
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,360
Good morning.

4
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,920
How are you doing?

5
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,880
I'm doing well. How are you today?

6
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,000
Good. It's an interesting time.

7
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,720
I feel like everybody's almost adjusted

8
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,960
to this new normal, right?

9
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,920
Yeah. I mean, I don't know,

10
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
if you want to call it normal,

11
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,600
but it certainly is a new way

12
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,200
of experiencing life.

13
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,040
Definitely. I mean after, what it's been,

14
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,000
like twelve weeks already,

15
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,800
waking up and just opening the computer

16
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,200
and getting ready for the first meeting.

17
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,800
Not even thinking about

18
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,320
which office I have to go to.

19
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,960
I mean, that's unfortunately for me,

20
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,560
already becoming a new norm.

21
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,240
But we can only be helpful.

22
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,080
Ariel, such an impressive background.

23
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,960
And I can't wait to talk to you

24
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,640
about scaling and about cyber security.

25
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,200
And your different experiences

26
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,640
from an MBA at Wharton

27
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,760
to being an executive within Netflix,

28
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,920
and really overseeing

29
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,120
some incredible incredible scale,

30
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,040
and different challenges there

31
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,200
that I'd love to hear about.

32
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,760
And now, going to be a partner

33
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,360
at Scale Venture Partners.

34
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,680
And sitting on the boards

35
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,840
of some incredible companies

36
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,680
like Honeycomb and PerimeterX,

37
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,560
whom I admire.

38
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,320
Ariel, who are you?

39
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,360
Give me a little bit of a rundown,

40
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,160
and then I have some some deep dives

41
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,400
that I want to do with you.

42
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,280
Sure. So first, I'll give you

43
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,000
the geographical history.

44
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,680
So, originally from Georgia

45
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,920
in the former Soviet Union,

46
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,960
the country, not the state,

47
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,560
which is something I would like

48
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,320
to preface or [--] with.

49
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,120
Moved at a young age to Israel.

50
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,720
Spent about seven years there

51
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,000
growing up as a kid.

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,520
And then, my dad got a job here

53
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,920
in the Bay Area and moved here,

54
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,760
about the end of middle school.

55
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,240
And lived in the Bay Area ever since.

56
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,800
From a career standpoint,

57
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,400
I really followed my father's footsteps.

58
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,880
He was a software engineer back when

59
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,840
they weren't called software engineers.

60
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,000
And he just really taught me

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,280
the ins and outs of programming.

62
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:25,960
And I enjoyed that

63
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,480
from just a very young age.

64
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,080
When did you start programming?

65
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,440
Say again?

66
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,600
When did you start programming?

67
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,120
I started programming back in Israel.

68
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,280
Gosh, I think I was,

69
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,280
so, I left Israel when I was 10.

70
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,520
And this was a couple of years

71
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,120
before I left.

72
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,000
So, probably, seven or eight.

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,040
My mom signed me up for some

74
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,880
basic programming class for teenagers.

75
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,680
But she had some a connection there.

76
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,840
They were able to get me on early

77
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,560
because I was just very interested in it.

78
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,720
I mean, today with Code Monkey

79
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,080
and all these different softwares,

80
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,000
if you're seven and eight

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,080
and you're not coding yet,

82
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,320
you're a little bit out of the game.

83
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,000
But in your time,

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,200
so, going to programming

85
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,760
at seven or eight,

86
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,400
that's pretty unheard of.

87
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,280
Yeah, it was fine.

88
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,080
I got my first Commodore 64,

89
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,000
which was the first computer

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,960
I played around with

91
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,320
and had just incredible

92
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,360
amount of fun with it.

93
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,320
So, when I came to the states

94
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,160
I knew what my career path was

95
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,760
without thinking about it too much.

96
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,960
So, I went and got computer science degree

97
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,280
from UC Berkeley.

98
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,080
And started out as a software engineer.

99
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,960
Had an incredible fulfilling time

100
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,640
doing it for a number of years.

101
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,000
And then, got a little a little bored

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,280
with just the coding side of it.

103
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,920
And I was at Siebel Systems at the time.

104
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
And the company

105
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,200
was just growing like crazy.

106
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,440
This was back in the late '90s.

107
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,840
And I got the opportunity

108
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,960
to manage a team.

109
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,240
So, I said, "Hey, why not?"

110
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,040
"This looks interesting."

111
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,560
And the different challenge

112
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,880
that I don't understand anything about.

113
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,160
So, what could possibly go wrong?

114
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,320
And so, I started managing a team

115
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,640
and really went into

116
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,480
engineering management from there.

117
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,840
What was it like doing that transition

118
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,400
from an engineer to managing

119
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,240
a team of engineers?

120
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,560
I made that transition early in the IDF

121
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,160
and it was a little bit different

122
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,360
from what I expected it to be.

123
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,440
Yeah. I really enjoyed it.

124
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,680
Particularly back then,

125
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,480
as a first time manager,

126
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,440
I think, these days too,

127
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,000
of the first my manager, I mean,

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,440
you're really going to bridging the gap

129
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,600
between being one of the experts,

130
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,160
from the expert from the technical side,

131
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,840
which is, what got you successful

132
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,760
and got you the opportunity

133
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,640
to become a manager.

134
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,520
To learning how to handle the human side

135
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,000
of it and the interpersonal side of it,

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,440
and the team and dynamics of it.

137
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,760
And so, this is I think, a common thread

138
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,400
that goes through my selection process

139
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,400
when I think about opportunities.

140
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,520
And both on the job side

141
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,280
as well as project side is.

142
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,880
If I don't feel like I am learning

143
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,360
more than I am teaching,

144
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,520
then I just get a little bit bored

145
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,040
in a particular role that I'm in.

146
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,160
So, for that, it was like,

147
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,560
this is a whole new world.

148
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,160
I don't understand very much about it.

149
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,640
It sounds really interesting.

150
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,200
And so, I went, I took Siebel at the time,

151
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,360
had a bunch of internal classes

152
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,840
that I took around situational leadership.

153
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,880
And you know, the usual slate, right?

154
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,840
And I did try to get up to speed

155
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,880
on being a first line manager.

156
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,840
And I loved all that.

157
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,160
And so, it was a very different

158
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,760
set of muscles that you have to build.

159
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,560
You have to know how to talk

160
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,400
and understand people rather than code,

161
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,600
which is very different.

162
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,560
Code is much more predictable,

163
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,320
I would say.

164
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,600
But I enjoyed it.

165
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,280
And so, that got me started

166
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,240
down that path.

167
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,640
And then, I got promoted fairly quickly

168
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,680
into different bigger and bigger teams.

169
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,040
And then, Siebel got acquired by Oracle

170
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,000
back in, it was in 2006.

171
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,040
And so, that was a time for me

172
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
to say, "Pause."

173
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,840
And say, "Okay, what's next?"

174
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,400
Oracle. I don't want to disparage

175
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,280
the company in any way.

176
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,040
But it was never on my list of,

177
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,040
hey, this is the company

178
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,920
that I wanted to go work for.

179
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,040
It was a relatively large organization.

180
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,640
And that wasn't

181
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,760
what really appealed to me.

182
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,400
I really like the small team, and at the

183
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,400
startup entrepreneurial side of things.

184
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,560
So, I decided to stay at Oracle

185
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,520
post the acquisition, but go back

186
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,160
and fulfill an earlier part of my desire

187
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,680
in my career,

188
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,880
which was get a better understanding

189
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,840
of the other side of the business.

190
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,640
I went I did my computer science

191
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,280
undergrad at Cal.

192
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,720
I also, my plan was to do

193
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,760
a double major in business.

194
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,760
And as many plans, that one's didn't come

195
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,600
into complete fruition.

196
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,400
So, you settled for an MBA at Wharton?

197
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,440
Say again?

198
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,160
So, you settled for an MBA at Wharton?

199
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,360
Yes, that's right. That's right.

200
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,960
So, I decided to do the MBA work.

201
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,960
It was actually a funny story

202
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,680
because I made the decision,

203
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,520
it was one of those things that,

204
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,160
you think about it for years,

205
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,000
but then you make the decision on a dime.

206
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,360
And so,  I made a decision,

207
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,040
I think, within like a couple of weeks

208
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,760
of the application due date.

209
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,800
I remember my family and I

210
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,160
were going to Tahoe over the holiday break

211
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,400
in December. And that was when

212
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,920
the applications were due.

213
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,600
And so, I was busy writing

214
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,160
my entrance essay

215
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,360
for why they should take me,

216
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,000
as my friends and family

217
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,440
were skiing on the slopes.

218
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,880
But anyway,

219
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,280
Wharton was a great experience.

220
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,720
Particularly coming from such

221
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,880
a heavy tech background,

222
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,360
I had a really hard time understanding

223
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,400
what the other side of the business did.

224
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,760
I was, looked at like sales and marketing

225
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,600
as overhead.

226
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,640
So, what are those guys doing?

227
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,840
We're doing all the hard stuff.

228
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,400
We're building everything.

229
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,040
They're out there trying to have drinks

230
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,160
and dinner with customers.

231
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,360
And living life

232
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,280
while we're paying their bills,

233
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,920
while we're also

234
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,880
working hard building, right?

235
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,800
We meet in the engineers of the company.

236
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,600
So, I figure, there's something there

237
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,040
that I wanted

238
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,080
to understand better ourselves.

239
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,800
So, Wharton gave me, I think,

240
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,520
a great perspective on that.

241
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,520
It was a really rewarding experience.

242
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,760
I would do it again in a heartbeat

243
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,240
if I had the chance.

244
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,120
Part of the appeal to me was,

245
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,720
again, I just loved learning so much.

246
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,360
That this was just

247
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,640
an intensive period of learning.

248
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,840
Where I was spending

249
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,280
20 hours a week, probably,

250
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,280
while working at Oracle

251
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,200
and doing classes and meetings

252
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,840
and all that.

253
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,000
And I just had a tremendous amount of fun.

254
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,080
I love that.

255
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,160
Ariel, when did you get excited

256
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,240
about scaling?

257
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,480
The word scale.

258
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,120
Well, I mean, it was almost,

259
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,240
it's funny you say that.

260
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,760
Because it was never really

261
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,760
something I pursued.

262
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,680
It was something in the background

263
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,440
that had to be done, right?

264
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,360
It's almost like good design.

265
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,720
It's not really something you,

266
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,000
at least for me, it wasn't something

267
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,600
I got passionate about.

268
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,360
But, as I went through

269
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,800
these different experiences,

270
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,920
it was something that I started developing,

271
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,400
more and more experience.

272
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,880
And whether it's starting

273
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,280
from smaller companies and building them

274
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,440
into larger teams and companies,

275
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,360
or it was the technical side of scaling

276
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,520
and starting out with a handful of users

277
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,600
that are mostly are friends and family

278
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,920
and going to thousands

279
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,160
and millions of users.

280
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,520
That was almost something

281
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,520
that had to be done.

282
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,520
That you think about your success

283
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,480
and pre-plan for your success early on,

284
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,480
rather than a path that I followed.

285
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,440
So, Netflix I think Netflix was the time

286
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,400
when that understanding of scaling

287
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,800
and how to build scalable

288
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,000
and distributed systems

289
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,200
really emerged for me.

290
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,240
[--]

291
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,560
Yeah.

292
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,400
You're the director

293
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,360
of Cloud Solutions at Netflix.

294
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,280
One of the most heavy consumers

295
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,040
of any cloud infrastructure

296
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,400
you can imagine.

297
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,600
I mean, that must be a crazy experience

298
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,400
in terms of scale,

299
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,080
in terms of responsibility. To understand

300
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,800
how to operate at scale, right?

301
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,440
I mean, this is unprecedented scale.

302
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,720
Yeah. I mean, in Netflix, I had the luxury

303
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,520
of actually working at a place like Netflix.

304
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,640
And Netflix, and I got to tell you,

305
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,440
if you don't already know,

306
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
just an incredible company.

307
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,880
The management culture there, and just

308
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,000
the kind of people that the company

309
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,520
is able to attract is just incredible.

310
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,040
I've never been in any other organization

311
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,600
where I felt the team was,

312
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,560
well, I take that back,

313
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,160
there were maybe one other time

314
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,800
when we had a group of 10 people

315
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,600
that were the most the highest,

316
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,040
best tech people in the company

317
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,760
who put together for a small project.

318
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,200
But outside of that, in any kind of scale,

319
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,800
a thousand engineers, I think,

320
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,280
was roughly the size of the organization

321
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,240
when I was there on Netflix and working.

322
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,040
Everyone you go to is just,

323
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,160
knows what they're doing. Expert.

324
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,080
And not just that, but also,

325
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,120
like a mature individual.

326
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,320
Not somebody that has to be a manager.

327
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,640
We read for one of my classes at Stanford,

328
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,360
we read there,

329
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,480
seven of your 100 page slide.

330
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,565
The Culture Deck. Yeah.

331
00:13:49,565 --> 00:13:51,280
The Culture Deck. Unbelievable.

332
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,440
I mean, that was just incredible to see.

333
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,240
Yeah. I mean, I'll tell you a funny one

334
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,560
if you want stories.

335
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,960
I'll tell you a funny story.

336
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,600
Before Netflix, I was at a company

337
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,080
called Sungevity,

338
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,760
which was also pretty cool company.

339
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,120
They were doing residential solar.

340
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,160
And my team was responsible

341
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,200
for technology, which was

342
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,720
the first time in the industry

343
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,080
that allowed homeowners

344
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,800
to get a solar system design

345
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
for their roofs,

346
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,320
without ever having the contractor

347
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,160
come after their homes

348
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,840
and measured it, right?

349
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,720
So, we use aerial satellite imagery

350
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,280
in order to create

351
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,680
three dimensional models and design.

352
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,280
And then have a remote solar to design it,

353
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,960
but, it's less relevant.

354
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,240
I was on the management team there.

355
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,400
I was running the technology part

356
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,640
of the business. And the last

357
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,280
executive management team meeting

358
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,600
that I was in the company,

359
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,640
was all of us sitting down

360
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,400
and reviewing the Netflix culture slides

361
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,280
as a management team, and saying,

362
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,560
"This is a great set of cultures slides."

363
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,840
"As inpirationally, what can we pick

364
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,600
from these things

365
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,120
to incorporate into our organization?"

366
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,880
Amazing.

367
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,280
And then, a month or two later,

368
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,000
I think, I was at the company of Netflix.

369
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,840
So, that was serendipitous.

370
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,920
And funny enough,

371
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,800
it wasn't even planned.

372
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,360
So, I didn't actually go and apply there.

373
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,080
I connected to somebody

374
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,600
at a social gathering

375
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,760
who was working there

376
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,120
and he got me introduced.

377
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,560
So, Netflix, the picture of scaling there

378
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,000
was just incredible. And I'd say,

379
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,120
not just from the technical side,

380
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,040
also, organizationally.

381
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,720
Like the way that they were able to scale

382
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,440
this freedom

383
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,680
and responsibility culture there,

384
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,120
which I still, to this day quote and love,

385
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,520
is one that I just,

386
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,400
I haven't seen effective anywhere else.

387
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,000
And that just empowers individuals

388
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,520
to do just amazing things.

389
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,840
Wow. That's incredible.

390
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,720
So, I want to move on

391
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,360
to Scale Venture Partners.

392
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
Because I think, the work

393
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:45,880
that you're doing there

394
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,000
is really incredible.

395
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,480
And your expertise side on the industries

396
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,120
you're focused on.

397
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,880
And I'd love you to tell me

398
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,720
a little bit more, what does it mean.

399
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,960
What is Scale Venture Partners?

400
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,960
And what is it about

401
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,800
cloud infrastructure, cyber security,

402
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,760
the companies you invest in?

403
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,840
And why are you so excited about that?

404
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,800
Because you're also coming

405
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,600
from a very management background.

406
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,000
And not too many people who go

407
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,680
also the management route have that passion

408
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,600
for cybersecurity and infrastructure.

409
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,280
Yet you seem to have that interesting

410
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,720
junction of the both of them.

411
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,080
Yeah.

412
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,280
As with most things, some was by design.

413
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,520
And in some, was just the path

414
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,600
that ended up being taken.

415
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,920
So, first, I'll give you

416
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,520
a blurb about scale.

417
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,680
Scale, it's been around

418
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,760
for a few decades now.

419
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,560
I joined, thankfully, a team

420
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,840
that was fully formed

421
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,360
and extremely successful.

422
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,960
So, that was a wonderful

423
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,880
organization to join.

424
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,480
That it was already successful

425
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,800
and doing great things.

426
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,560
So, I joined in 2013.

427
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,080
And I was doing fund for the firm.

428
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,400
And we're now currently on fund six,

429
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,840
and will at some point

430
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,800
be raising fund seven.

431
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,920
The mission of the firm

432
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,320
is really to help companies

433
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,120
once they build a product

434
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,760
and have some initial market validation

435
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,880
to take those early revenues.

436
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,240
And scale and build it

437
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,160
into the business, right?

438
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,040
So, the term "scale", that refers to

439
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,880
scaling organizations, scaling revenues,

440
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,480
scaling businesses.

441
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,920
So, what we don't invest in is

442
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,520
typically the seed stage. When it's,

443
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,360
the folks coming out of university

444
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,800
and they have an idea,

445
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,680
or out of industry and they have an idea

446
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,280
and they want the capital

447
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,800
in order to build that.

448
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,720
That's the part of the market

449
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,360
that we don't address

450
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,560
from a capital standpoint.

451
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,360
But once they expand,

452
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,360
they're six, 12, 18 months, whatever.

453
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,720
Building it,

454
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,440
getting some initial design partners,

455
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,560
getting some market validation

456
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,680
and some early revenues,

457
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,520
that's where we get involved.

458
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
Typically series As, series Bs, series Cs.

459
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,840
Different stages in that scaling phase

460
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,800
and help them build those revenues.

461
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,760
And a lot of what the firm's resources

462
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,640
are oriented around, is, how do you avoid

463
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,680
some of the common scaling mistakes.

464
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,520
When do you hire.

465
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,520
When's the right time to hire.

466
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,720
And what are some of these

467
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,080
biggest mistakes in business?

468
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,120
I was just gonna say, most often the time,

469
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,880
the answer is,

470
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,280
when you think it's the time to hire,

471
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,480
it means probably it's too late.

472
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,600
You should've started six months ago

473
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,640
or 12 months ago.

474
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,880
I've been hearing that so much.

475
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,960
Yeah. When do you start building

476
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,560
some of these processes in place

477
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,440
around understanding conversion,

478
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,840
around understanding

479
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,920
your pipeline generation.

480
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,040
All of this go to market side

481
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,920
of the business,

482
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,440
which is usually the set up systems

483
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,080
that you have to build

484
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,160
after you've got the product

485
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,240
and you've been successful

486
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,400
getting your product to market.

487
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,920
So, that's the idea of scale.

488
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,600
And we've had the, I guess,

489
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,980
the, I'd say part luck.

490
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:39,560
Part, our own picking,

491
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,400
selected some great companies

492
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,840
to be part of the portfolio,

493
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,280
and some great successes in the past.

494
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,280
Something I'm particularly proud of,

495
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,920
in terms of my own.

496
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,600
When you do join a company,

497
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,680
and you join their journey

498
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,800
as they're about to scale, so,

499
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,560
let's say they're raising their series A,

500
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,840
they have some paying customers,

501
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,960
they have had a market validation,

502
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,280
and they're ready to scale their product

503
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,320
and to grow it,

504
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,120
What role do you take

505
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,400
in helping them do that?

506
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,160
Are you more of, sort of a bystander

507
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,200
who is just over looking and giving them

508
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,360
a Yea or Nay?

509
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,720
Are you very active

510
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,080
in looking at their plan

511
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,480
and talking to their customers,

512
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,760
and understanding whether

513
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,560
they actually have market validation

514
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,560
or, if they're just

515
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,000
under the false assumption?

516
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,960
Where do you fit in there?

517
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah, we talked to a lot of customers

518
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,680
before we make the investment.

519
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,400
So, that's typically

520
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,560
part of our diligence process

521
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,000
is to understand,

522
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,280
Is there really a fit there.

523
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,880
Is their product market fit there.

524
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,320
And so, we do, we'll talk to

525
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,200
a couple dozen different customers.

526
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,440
Both customers, as well as prospects,

527
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,000
as well as folks in our own network

528
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,720
who would be typical buyers

529
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,720
and to validate that there's

530
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,960
a product market fit there.

531
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,160
So, that typically happens

532
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,400
before we make the investment.

533
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:49,960
And so, we get

534
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,360
to that level of conviction.

535
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,360
And by the way, is that easier

536
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,040
as you're more concentrated

537
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,120
on a specific industry?

538
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,320
So, if you're concentrated on

539
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,265
cloud infrastructure and cybersecurity,

540
00:19:58,265 --> 00:19:59,440
Yeah. Absolutely.

541
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,160
Because it's all the same players

542
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,560
come up quite often, right?

543
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,720
Well, that's one.

544
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,960
And then the other is,

545
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,360
you just have a much better ability

546
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,600
to determine the quality

547
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,280
of the answers you're getting, right?

548
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,560
So, you can put people in the bucket

549
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,120
of these folks understand it,

550
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,040
because they understand

551
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,280
the complexities of the world.

552
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,440
And when it comes to infrastructure,

553
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,840
and it might be early adopters,

554
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,160
and early signals,

555
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,280
or these folks are just going to do

556
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,120
what they read about

557
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,880
in the technical press.

558
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,440
And then, that gives you

559
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,320
a different type of data point.

560
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,200
So, I certainly think

561
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,520
having that experience,

562
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,680
I think let's you understand

563
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,600
where the market is going,

564
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,440
maybe a few months, a few quarters earlier

565
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,720
than when it would be otherwise obvious.

566
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,800
So, back to your question around

567
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,160
how involved do we get,

568
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,920
I mean, the answer is, fairly involved.

569
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,080
And this is something that

570
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,000
I personally find extremely satisfying

571
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,640
and rewarding about this role is,

572
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,280
I don't want to be there sitting

573
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,520
once a quarter, or saying:

574
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,200
Yea or Nay,

575
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,680
Do this. Don't do this.

576
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:08,280
Because I don't think that's effective.

577
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,640
In the areas where I feel I can add value,

578
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,040
I get fairly involved in those.

579
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,920
Those fall into

580
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,880
a couple of different buckets,

581
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,960
One is, well,

582
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,800
what's the expertise of the firm.

583
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,720
That's certainly something

584
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,800
that we have a lot of resources

585
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,720
and personal experience with.

586
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,680
And that's around,

587
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,720
how do you scale revenues,

588
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,600
and how do you build

589
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,040
some of these systems I mentioned.

590
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,120
And then the other side is around

591
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,360
just the product

592
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,200
and the technical side of it.

593
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,280
And that's something that I think,

594
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,600
I bring uniquely from my own background.

595
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,800
In understanding how to build

596
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,600
engineering teams,

597
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,240
understanding how to build products

598
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,760
and even some of the technical

599
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,880
and scaling side of it.

600
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,800
One of the first things I did

601
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,560
when I started scale,

602
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,880
before I could really add any value

603
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,320
on the venture side,

604
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,240
because I was completely new to venture

605
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,160
when I first joined, is,

606
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,160
I went round to different

607
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,120
portfolio companies

608
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,240
and essentially gave them my talk

609
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,640
that I used to give it Netflix, around,

610
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,760
Hey, how do you build large,

611
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,920
scalable, distributed systems

612
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,200
that are fault tolerant and resilient?

613
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,280
And that was something

614
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,480
that was very valuable

615
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,560
to those engineering teams.

616
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,080
But also because you got to experience

617
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,400
the portfolio companies potentially

618
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,040
at a deeper way

619
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,480
than a lot of other partners did.

620
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,560
Because from understanding also,

621
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,760
not every partner is involved

622
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,360
with every company.

623
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,080
And you got to understand

624
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,120
the portfolio a little bit better.

625
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,160
Ariel, the last minute that we have,

626
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,120
are there specific places

627
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,120
that the market is going to

628
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,920
that you're especially excited about that?

629
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,200
That young people coming out

630
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,920
of 8200 or Stanford could be thinking up

631
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,560
in the realms of cloud infrastructure,

632
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,680
cyber security.

633
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,280
The world has changed dramatically

634
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,480
over the past few months.

635
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,120
What are some of the the key places

636
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,920
that you think bright minds

637
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,440
should put their effort?

638
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,640
You know, that's a really good question.

639
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,240
And I can give you an answer

640
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,080
to that question.

641
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,000
But my first reaction to that would be,

642
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,400
don't listen to anything

643
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,440
that a venture capitalist

644
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,200
or investor tells you.

645
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,560
It should be the area

646
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,280
that you're focusing on.

647
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,800
Because honestly, even I come from

648
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
a fairly technical background,

649
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,000
but it's now seven years

650
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,440
since I've been an operator.

651
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,240
And my information is,

652
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,160
it's gotten fairly fast, okay, right?

653
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,600
And so, whatever I think it is,

654
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,360
it's probably things

655
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,720
that I've heard from others.

656
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,080
And, what I would encourage folks to do

657
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,960
is understand,

658
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,400
from their own vantage point

659
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,320
where are gaps in the market

660
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,520
and then build to that.

661
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,560
Because, it's those folks

662
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,680
that are in the trenches,

663
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,320
that are building it,

664
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,000
that are understanding

665
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,680
where those challenges lie.

666
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,160
That I think, is the best position.

667
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,600
We figure it out later

668
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,560
after it's been built,

669
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,320
and after the customers already tell us

670
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,840
that this is something.

671
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,440
So, my initial answer,

672
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,040
in terms of specific areas,

673
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,200
I think the cloud infrastructure

674
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,280
side of things is just

675
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,880
extremely nascent at this point.

676
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,720
We're in the very very early days

677
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,280
of having, we've just released DMs, right?

678
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,160
As a technology, when it comes to

679
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,920
fast forward to the equivalent

680
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,880
and the infrastructure.

681
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,440
So, every company that's doing anything

682
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,240
at a reasonable scale

683
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,360
from an engineering standpoint,

684
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,680
needs to build its own platform

685
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,040
from the ground up.

686
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,680
And usually constructed

687
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,520
in different pieces.

688
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,680
So, I'm still waiting to see

689
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,840
who will solve this problem,

690
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,600
who is going to come up with a way

691
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,480
of building cloud native applications

692
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,240
where you don't have to custom built

693
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,760
to AWS and GCP and USHER,

694
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,400
and you don't have to worry

695
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,560
about scaling up.

696
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,680
You see two instances.

697
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,440
You don't have to worry about setting up

698
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,840
security groups and ELBs and so on.

699
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,160
So, like that piece of it,

700
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,560
I think is still missing.

701
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,600
So, that's one that I'm always

702
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,640
on the lookout for

703
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,480
on the infrastructure side.

704
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,600
The other side of it,

705
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,560
I think there's also around various parts

706
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,440
in the development lifecycle.

707
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,000
I hear that a lot. Yeah.

708
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,120
Yeah. As the infrastructure changes,

709
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,600
the management and orchestration

710
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,320
and workflow piece of it

711
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,200
has to change as well.

712
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,840
So, whether it's in software or quality

713
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,600
or in deployment,

714
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,960
each one of those pieces is,

715
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,920
every time there's a shift

716
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,880
in the underlying infrastructure,

717
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,360
the management side of it has to solve.

718
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,240
As a software engineer myself,

719
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,320
going through these processes

720
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,440
and working on a variety of projects,

721
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,680
both professionally, academically,

722
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,360
I definitely see that as a huge potential

723
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,960
and a place that I'm personally

724
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,120
very excited about.

725
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,080
Ariel, before we leave,

726
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,120
I have to ask you the hardest question

727
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,760
putting you on the spot one last time,

728
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,800
three words that you would use

729
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,640
to describe yourself,

730
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,000
or that any of your partners

731
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,400
at Scale Venture Partners,

732
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,840
would describe you as.

733
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,920
I don't want to answer that question.

734
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,200
I hate talking about myself.

735
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:47,040
And certainly is not something I enjoy.

736
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,720
That's definitely, I think,

737
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,000
a valuable answer.

738
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,440
Maybe, I say Curious.

739
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,920
I'll take curious.

740
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,360
Curious is good enough for all three.

741
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,840
And I appreciate the response.

742
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,440
And I think, that's also something

743
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,080
that is, I think, quite interesting

744
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,680
with people who are really excited

745
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,960
about helping others accomplish things

746
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,480
and watching a lot of great people

747
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,520
around them succeed.

748
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,240
And I truly truly appreciate it.

749
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,200
Ariel, thank you for your time.

750
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,240
Toda raba.

751
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,360
Absolutely. I mean,

752
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,800
I'll leave your listeners

753
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,080
with one last talk, which is,

754
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,440
I think everybody

755
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,200
who is your peer right now

756
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,640
has an incredible place in life

757
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,760
that you don't get to experience

758
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,520
very often. You're the world.

759
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,480
The world is the opportunity right now.

760
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,840
And so, don't listen to everybody

761
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,480
that says, "No.",

762
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,720
for every one of your ideas.

763
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,400
Because you're gonna get 100 Nos

764
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,800
for Every every you Yes you get.

765
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,280
So, have the passion.

766
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,600
Have the conviction to do

767
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,360
what you believe in.

768
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,800
And I think you'll have

769
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,320
an incredible time in your life.

770
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,120
100%.

771
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,160
