1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,080
As we come out of this,

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,240
our expectation is that

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,520
there's going to be

4
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,960
good real estate out there,

5
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,120
unfortunately, because some restaurants

6
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,640
aren't going to survive this.

7
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,360
And the restaurants

8
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,000
that we're able to weather the storm

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,360
are going to be

10
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,570
in a good position to grow.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,472
Chuck Imerson,

12
00:00:45,473 --> 00:00:47,240
thank you for joining me.

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,880
Asian Box, I love it.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,160
Thank you.

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,560
Oh, we love our raving fans.

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,160
That's for sure.

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,080
Chuck, thank you, first of all,

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,120
for all the amazing work

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,400
that you're doing with Asian Box.

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,680
I've had a lot of people

21
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,640
on this show so far.

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,000
You're probably my favorite one,

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,240
I have to say, because you brought

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,640
so much happiness to me

25
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,720
in my time in Palo Alto.

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,800
And that when I return to Palo Alto,

27
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,720
I'll continue having that great time.

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,560
But you bring such happiness

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,720
to so many different people

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,720
across the chains of Asian box.

31
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,560
That it's a really

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,440
an honor to meet you.

33
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,600
Because I think Asian Box

34
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,120
is a different type of restaurant

35
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,840
than a lot of others.

36
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,600
And I'll let you expand on that.

37
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,000
But, Chuck, before we get into that,

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,280
talk to me a little bit about yourself.

39
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,880
And how do you get to become

40
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,640
the chief executive officer

41
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,640
of a restaurant chain?

42
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,160
Well, you know,

43
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,320
I've been in the business

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,640
since I got out of school.

45
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,920
And I spent a lot of time

46
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,360
with Marie Callender's restaurant,

47
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,960
which is a well-known chain.

48
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,360
And then I moved over to start ups.

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,600
I actually did LYFE Kitchen,

50
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,000
which was also in Palo Alto.

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,440
And that meeting

52
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,480
with the founders of Asian Box,

53
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,920
and we had a good connection.

54
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,840
And in 2014, I came over

55
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,360
and joined the team

56
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,680
to head of operations,

57
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,080
and you know, with their work.

58
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,400
And then over time,

59
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,520
the founder moved on.

60
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,160
And I have an opportunity to move up.

61
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,680
And I got to take over

62
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,520
just before covid entered our lives.

63
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,920
So, it's been an exciting

64
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,120
and challenging time for sure.

65
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,280
Right.

66
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,680
I actually bumped into you, I remember,

67
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,200
in one of the Palo Alto restaurants.

68
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,680
And I remember sitting there

69
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,920
and somehow, I came to realize

70
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,480
that the CEO of Asian Box

71
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,040
is going to come.

72
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,800
And I just thought to myself,

73
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,207
"Oh, my God".

74
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,880
You know, I've met a bunch of CEOs

75
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,880
from the tech scene,

76
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,360
but they're not nearly as exciting

77
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,640
as the CEO of Asian Box,

78
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,960
where I eat almost every single day.

79
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,000
So, it was a very funny coincidence.

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,920
Chuck, give me a little bit

81
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,200
of insight into what Asian box is.

82
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,400
And why is that a bit

83
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,600
of a different restaurant

84
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,120
than the average restaurant

85
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,800
we would see on the street?

86
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,240
Well, you know,

87
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,720
we are Vietnamese street food.

88
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,720
A couple of things

89
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,680
I think may make us different

90
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,080
is that we're 100% gluten free.

91
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,760
You know, just naturally,

92
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,200
about with the ingredients we use.

93
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,000
So, anybody who's looking for that

94
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,720
can feel comfortable and safe.

95
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,720
Vietnamese food is your everyday food.

96
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,880
And with our ingredients,

97
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,240
we have top quality ingredients,

98
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,560
which I think separates us

99
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,600
from some of the competition.

100
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,640
And the food travels well.

101
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,160
We have good portions.

102
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,320
We were founded on "build your own",

103
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,480
which people really enjoy being

104
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,760
having that flexibility

105
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,200
of being able to you know,

106
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,760
create their flavor profile

107
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,560
that they want,

108
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,920
the box that they want.

109
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,280
In addition, now we've added

110
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,080
about a dozen signature boxes as well,

111
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,640
so, to make it easier for people

112
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,120
that just want to come in and

113
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,280
pick something with the chef together.

114
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,600
Right.

115
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,840
So, when you walk in,

116
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,520
you get the workout,

117
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,640
you get those types of things.

118
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,280
But you can also create your own box.

119
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,680
And I have to say

120
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,280
that one of the things

121
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,840
that really impressed me

122
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,320
when I got introduced to Asian Box,

123
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,840
I believe it was 2013, early 2014,

124
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,000
I was just running

125
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,200
a high school startup.

126
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,560
And I remember

127
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,600
we would always walk

128
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,080
to Town & Country to eat at Asian Box.

129
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,080
And I remember that, you know,

130
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,640
that everything just seemed so natural.

131
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,800
All the way from the plate

132
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:15,840
to the utensils.

133
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,920
The actual food seemed so fresh.

134
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,000
How do you get that?

135
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,200
How do you bring that feeling

136
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,920
to the customer?

137
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,400
Well, you know,

138
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,520
you give a lot of credit to

139
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,400
you know, the founders

140
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,680
that put it together.

141
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,840
Gracie Nguyen who is the chef,

142
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,880
it's her family recipes.

143
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,640
Chad and Frank

144
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,080
or the other two founders,

145
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,840
really put together everything

146
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,440
from the compostable container

147
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,680
to the sourcing,

148
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,840
working locally where possible

149
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,240
and you know, again,

150
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,880
the freshest quality ingredients.

151
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,520
And the good news is, you know,

152
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,960
that particular location,

153
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,040
that's our flagship store

154
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,320
that I know you've been a regular

155
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,080
for quite some time.

156
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,080
And we feed Stanford,

157
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,120
we feed the hospital,

158
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,480
we feed the high school.

159
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,560
And we've been very fortunate.

160
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,320
We have a big following there

161
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,760
in addition to the catering,

162
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,200
which, again, with our food,

163
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,960
the way it holds, the way it travels,

164
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,640
we built up, well, prior to covid,

165
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,040
built a strong catering business as well.

166
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,560
So, I think all of that

167
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
kind of comes together.

168
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,920
You know, the biggest thing is,

169
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,120
is the team, you know.

170
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,840
The manager that we've had,

171
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,800
the mangers we've had.

172
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,440
The one now who's been in charge

173
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,720
of that store,

174
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,640
Wendy, for several years,

175
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,800
it's all about she's the leader.

176
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
She sets the pace, training the staff,

177
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,120
developing the staff.

178
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,360
And all of them are, you know,

179
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,680
live around the community.

180
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,480
They all are passionate about the food,

181
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,400
what we're trying to do

182
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,600
as far as the lifestyle

183
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,640
and just taking care

184
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,000
of customers, you know,

185
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,840
with the smile.

186
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,680
Right.

187
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,640
You're giving a lot of

188
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,520
autonomy and credibility

189
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,720
to the restaurant manager,

190
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,560
Wendy, from Town & Country.

191
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,200
So, first of all, thank you, Wendy.

192
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,800
But Chuck, you're the CEO of the chain.

193
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,560
What is your responsibility then

194
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,800
as the CEO once you have

195
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,600
a really amazing people

196
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,720
running the local businesses?

197
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,680
Well, you know, I think,

198
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,320
again, it starts with the people

199
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,760
I mean, I've been fortunate,

200
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,400
we have eight stores now.

201
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,680
And we have eight

202
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,160
great managers that care.

203
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,200
That if I was going

204
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
to start another company,

205
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,120
I would happily bring

206
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,400
any of them over.

207
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,760
And to me, that's kind of

208
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,520
the barometer that I want to use

209
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,280
that these people all,

210
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,160
to your point, they have autonomy,

211
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,360
they feel a sense of ownership,

212
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,400
they go that extra mile.

213
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:40,960
All of our cashiers are empowered

214
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,640
to take care of any issue.

215
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,880
It's not know, you know,

216
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,640
they all have a level of ownership.

217
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,880
Or if there's a problem,

218
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,000
we're going to take care of it.

219
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,920
And it's not going to be

220
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,800
through a process,

221
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,640
it's just going to be right now.

222
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,120
And, you know, getting those teams,

223
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,040
building them

224
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,520
and then helping them build

225
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,760
their branches

226
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,280
and keeping them focused

227
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,800
on what's important. Right now,

228
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,000
obviously, we can't stress safety enough

229
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,520
with everything going on in the world.

230
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,880
So, we spent a lot of time talking about

231
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,520
that and what does that mean

232
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,040
and what's the perception of the consumer,

233
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,800
and being very ahead of

234
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,480
what the guest expects.

235
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,720
That makes a lot of sense.

236
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,720
And how do you think more critically

237
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,960
about what the guest expects?

238
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,160
Because as the CEO,

239
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,960
I'm imagining that

240
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,000
you're setting the tone

241
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
for the expectation

242
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,200
across all the chains.

243
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,680
Right?

244
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,760
Aligning the vision,

245
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,000
aligning the strategy that at the end,

246
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,880
the great people

247
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,920
that are working there,

248
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,560
they should aspire to.

249
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,960
So, how do you adjust to that role?

250
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,600
And what are some

251
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,400
of the thinking process

252
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,320
that goes on behind that?

253
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,520
Well, you know, it's kind of two part

254
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,800
when it's the business

255
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,960
of where are we going,

256
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,920
you know, long term.

257
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,640
Whether that's the marketing,

258
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,760
whether that's new menu items,

259
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,360
whether that's different promotions

260
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,360
or whatever we're offering.

261
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,000
But I think what's more important is

262
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,880
keeping it very simple for the managers.

263
00:08:09,881 --> 00:08:11,920
It's you know, the restaurant business

264
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,000
is really a lot of common sense

265
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,800
and hospitality.

266
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,680
And if everybody understands

267
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,520
that we're here

268
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,600
to make the guest happy,

269
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,800
then that's our barometer

270
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,240
to making our decisions.

271
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,080
Then it simplifies it.

272
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,520
And the guests want the food

273
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,640
to come out fast, at a high quality,

274
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,840
obviously fresh, and made properly.

275
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,760
So, our procedures need to be

276
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,200
in place and validated.

277
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,520
We use where a third party service

278
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,080
that comes in

279
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,920
and acts as the health department,

280
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,480
in addition to the health department

281
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,280
and grades all the restaurants.

282
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,000
And we have a culinary person

283
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,920
who goes around

284
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,440
and works with the culinary teams

285
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,280
and teaching them new techniques

286
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,560
or just keeping them on track.

287
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,488
We do obviously,

288
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:02,720
all the safety procedures

289
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,160
you would expect any restaurant to do,

290
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,760
temperature checks

291
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,480
and all those throughout the day.

292
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:09,640
But the biggest thing is,

293
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,280
is the employees caring, you know.

294
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,960
And if they care,

295
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,320
they're going to take care of it.

296
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,440
And if they look at it as, okay,

297
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,720
I want the experience,

298
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,800
I'm going to deliver the experience

299
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,280
I want to have.

300
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,480
And we talk about that,

301
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,480
pre-shift meetings as far as

302
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,880
you know, we want to go fast,

303
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,680
but we don't want to rush.

304
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,800
So, the boxes need

305
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,360
to come out perfect every time.

306
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,640
And being that it's customizable,

307
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,880
there's a lot of different

308
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,720
variations of modifiers,

309
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,680
in addition to the fact

310
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,800
that there's a lot of sensitivity.

311
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,920
Some people are certainly,

312
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,760
obviously gluten free,

313
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,480
we don't to worry about

314
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,720
because we're 100% gluten free.

315
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,280
But we have peanuts

316
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,400
and other allergens that are there.

317
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,280
And educating our team

318
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,840
to be able to give the guests

319
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,360
what they want,

320
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,760
consistently, is a big deal.

321
00:10:00,761 --> 00:10:03,240
And consistency

322
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,640
is the biggest factor, I think.

323
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,160
When I teach managers

324
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,320
and teach the employees

325
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,120
and from my leadership,

326
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,920
consistency is that number one word.

327
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,680
Because people can trust that.

328
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,520
If you're consistent,

329
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,920
we have a lot of regulars like yourself.

330
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,840
I know we have a gentleman

331
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,880
at Palo Alto that comes in,

332
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
I think five days a week

333
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,040
and get the workout.

334
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,240
And obviously, he wants that workout

335
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,760
and he wants it that way.

336
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,200
Right.

337
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,640
And we have other examples of that.

338
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,640
And, you know, we're very transparent.

339
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,960
I get a lot of feedback from the guests

340
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,080
and I answer as many as I can.

341
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,320
And they care too, you know.

342
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,840
They understand that being gluten free

343
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,880
and being a fast casual,

344
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,720
especially right now,

345
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,560
they're very supportive.

346
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,040
That makes a lot of sense.

347
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,640
So, give me a little bit of context

348
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,240
as to how many restaurants are there.

349
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,000
What is sort of the circulation

350
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,920
of obviously just the parameters

351
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,520
that you can share?

352
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,200
Yeah, you know,

353
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,800
we opened the first store in early 2012,

354
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,440
and then we opened two more

355
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,400
in the following couple of years,

356
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,960
late 2012, actually, 2013.

357
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,320
I came on in 2014.

358
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,560
You know, we went through

359
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,640
a period where we didn't grow.

360
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,360
And then we opened

361
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,840
seven stores pretty quickly

362
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,360
in 2016 through 2018.

363
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,920
And we peaked at four

364
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,000
in Southern California

365
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and six in Northern California at ten.

366
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,080
Unfortunately, when the pandemic hit,

367
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,960
we made the tough decision

368
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,320
to let two stores go

369
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,400
in Southern California.

370
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,160
And then we have another store

371
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,080
in downtown LA that's temporarily closed

372
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,520
in part because of the pandemic,

373
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,240
but in part the

374
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,760
landlord's remodeling the center.

375
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,560
So, it was just coincidental timing.

376
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,040
So, we have seven stores operating today.

377
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,840
One in Irvine

378
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,200
and six in Northern California.

379
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,680
And we're throughout the peninsula

380
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,025
from down from San Jose

381
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:10,200
up to the Marina Chestnut store,

382
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,320
Burlingame, Mountain view.

383
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,140
And so, that's kind of

384
00:12:15,141 --> 00:12:16,880
where we're at today.

385
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,560
We are raising money right now.

386
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,880
We have a series-F open.

387
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,480
We feel like this is

388
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,040
the opportunity to grow right now,

389
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,600
even though these

390
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,840
are very challenging times.

391
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,920
We've weathered the storm to date.

392
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,640
And we feel like

393
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,040
we're going to come out stronger.

394
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,920
We've been forced

395
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,880
like a lot of our peers,

396
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,680
to make tough cuts,

397
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,160
to really look at our business

398
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,920
and so to speak,

399
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,520
trim the fat, so to speak.

400
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,640
Being very efficient with our labor cost,

401
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,280
with our food cost.

402
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,520
And looking at every expense

403
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,840
from our POS system

404
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,520
to everything you could imagine,

405
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,920
insurances.

406
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,480
And we feel like we've been

407
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,560
very efficient at the necessity.

408
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,560
We thought we were efficient.

409
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,600
We spent a lot of 2019

410
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,680
really kind of becoming

411
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,960
a more efficient company,

412
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,160
a more profitable company,

413
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,440
getting what we call

414
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,600
our prime costs down,

415
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,320
which is the term

416
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,360
in combination of food and labor,

417
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,400
a term in the restaurant industry.

418
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,240
And we really got that down

419
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,320
to where we could grow

420
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
and potentially start franchising,

421
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
but then covid hit.

422
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,040
So, we looked even deeper

423
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,960
and made some tough decisions.

424
00:13:30,961 --> 00:13:33,000
So, as we come out of this,

425
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,120
our expectation is that

426
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,480
there's going to be

427
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,880
good real estate out there,

428
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,040
unfortunately, because some restaurants

429
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,560
are not going to survive this.

430
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,360
And the restaurants that

431
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,920
were able to weather the storm

432
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,280
are going to be

433
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,240
in a good position to grow.

434
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,480
That's a very interesting way

435
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,200
of looking at it.

436
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,040
Yeah. And our thought process

437
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,480
is that as we get into next year,

438
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,000
right now, where we're as

439
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,080
is we basically lost

440
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,320
our catering business.

441
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,680
And I know we're not alone in that.

442
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,000
And that's 20% of our business.

443
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,400
And that hopefully will come back

444
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,440
when people feel comfortable

445
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,880
going back into the offices

446
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,000
and getting a comfort level.

447
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,760
And that might not be

448
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,040
till 2022 realistically.

449
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,560
And we understand that.

450
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,000
But our other business, our partners

451
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,800
with people like DoorDash and Grab Hub

452
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,200
and Uber Eats has helped us survive

453
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,520
in addition to, you know,

454
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,640
we partnered with SpotOn,

455
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,640
which is an up and coming POS system.

456
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,760
And they have the ability

457
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,200
for online ordering and app,

458
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,600
and all those things.

459
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,800
So, we flex great into that.

460
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,120
And it was kind of already in process,

461
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,960
but we really flex hard into that

462
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,440
to maximize the guests being able

463
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,800
to order easily and comfortably,

464
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,520
safely, whether they want

465
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,400
the food delivered

466
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,880
or pick up with non-contact.

467
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,080
We have all that happening.

468
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,120
And so, we built the trust back.

469
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,360
And over time we built

470
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,320
our business back up

471
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,680
to where, really the only thing

472
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,680
we're missing from last year is catering.

473
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,880
And like I said, I expect that

474
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,880
to come back eventually.

475
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,080
So, in a way, even though

476
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,760
we've gone through

477
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,200
a very challenging situation,

478
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
we're in a good position to grow.

479
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,040
And our hope is to raise some capital

480
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,080
and sign a couple of leases next year.

481
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,240
I have to say that I'm really inspired

482
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,640
by your take on the positioning

483
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,760
that you're saying,

484
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,840
we've entered this pandemic,

485
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,560
we had to make some very tough decisions,

486
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,120
we closed two restaurants,

487
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,240
we've pretty much lost

488
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,120
the catering business

489
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,800
because there really is no catering

490
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,280
in 2020 and likely 2021.

491
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,480
Yet we realize that

492
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,960
there are opportunities

493
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,280
for those that are able to

494
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,320
climb over the hill,

495
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,040
even if they're wounded.

496
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,520
But there are going to be opportunities

497
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,840
to grow into a relatively emptier market,

498
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,400
whether it's in real estate

499
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,640
or whether it's in customer acquisition.

500
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,880
And I'm sure that

501
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,040
you're thinking about that.

502
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,040
But I have to say that,

503
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,520
as a young entrepreneur

504
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,240
and not coming

505
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,400
from the restaurant scene,

506
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,000
I really love that entrepreneurial way

507
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,920
of thinking of going strong and saying,

508
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,800
okay, what is going to happen in the year

509
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,360
and how can we come out stronger.

510
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,520
Chuck, paint me a picture.

511
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,560
When covid hits,

512
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,360
what are the first steps

513
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,320
that the CEO makes

514
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,800
in the restaurant business?

515
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,720
Or what did you have to do immediately

516
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,200
as covid hits in order to adapt

517
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,640
and sort of align everybody

518
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,640
to this new reality that nobody knows

519
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,280
what's going to happen?

520
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,040
Yeah. You know,

521
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,640
I think like a lot of people,

522
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,040
you know, I can look at our financials

523
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,560
in March 17th, the day after

524
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,080
it was truly really announced

525
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,200
on a national level that,

526
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,680
hey, we need to lock down

527
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,840
and start buying toilet paper.

528
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,800
We really, at that point,

529
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,440
had a look at everything.

530
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,880
And we made some tough decisions,

531
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,520
like close four stores immediately

532
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,120
that I knew were going to be either

533
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,400
high traffic like the mall location,

534
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,160
the downtown location.

535
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,040
That I knew the offices

536
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,200
weren't going to be there.

537
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,280
And so, we paused

538
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,040
and we kind of evaluated

539
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,120
what the true impact was going to be.

540
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,200
And we took a hit pretty immediate,

541
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,200
like a lot of people.

542
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,600
And then we started getting strategic

543
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,160
and thinking about, okay,

544
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,080
what do we need to do.

545
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,280
We went to our partners,

546
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,640
as I mentioned earlier,

547
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,440
the third party delivery services

548
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,200
that we use.

549
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,932
We went to our POS system and said,

550
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,560
"Okay, how do we make this easier

551
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,400
for the guest?"

552
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,200
And we pivoted to that pretty quickly.

553
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,680
And we've seen some of our competitors.

554
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,920
You take, like [--],

555
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,440
they did make shift drive-thrus

556
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,840
in their parking lot because

557
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,320
they knew they had to compete

558
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,440
with the burger places

559
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,880
that have drive thru.

560
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,920
So, we knew that we needed

561
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,600
to make it as easy as possible

562
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,440
for the guests, you know,

563
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,040
where possible to offer curbside.

564
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,040
And we had some inherent challenges,

565
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,960
but we worked through those.

566
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,160
And, you know, and I think just

567
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,320
telling the teams,

568
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,840
the general managers like,

569
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,360
"Hey, communicate with your team,

570
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,800
let them know what's going on,

571
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,920
let's help them take care of themselves."

572
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,440
We have to obviously cut back

573
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,600
a lot of hours, help them figure out

574
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,120
how to get themselves taken care of,

575
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,560
whether it was

576
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,760
how to get on employment

577
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,960
or whatever the case may be.

578
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,720
Because we're all in this together.

579
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,440
And we had

580
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,440
to furlough some people immediately

581
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,480
and have a communication with them.

582
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,920
Because at the end of the day,

583
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,200
the hope was everybody

584
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,440
was going to come back.

585
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,840
And we wanted to make sure

586
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,560
that they were all still there.

587
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,440
And so we're still fighting that.

588
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,520
I have three people

589
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,000
on furlough right now,

590
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,400
still in that the catering department

591
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,800
and the downtown LA store

592
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,600
that I mentioned earlier,

593
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,400
that's temporarily closed.

594
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,440
But I've talked to those three people

595
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,360
every other week.

596
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,080
And they're ready to come back

597
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,600
and they're anxious.

598
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,440
And they've all taken part time jobs

599
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,760
because they've had to.

600
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,040
But they know

601
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,240
that I'm committed to them.

602
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,800
And as soon as we can get them back,

603
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,080
we will.

604
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,040
I think that one of the hardest things

605
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,600
to deal with as a leader

606
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,520
in any situation,

607
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,600
and especially in this situation,

608
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,840
is this uncertainty in communicating

609
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,880
through that uncertainty.

610
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,960
And one of the things that I've been

611
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,080
hearing a lot is this effort

612
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,280
to over communicate

613
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,920
and under communicate.

614
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,960
Especially in the time like covid-19.

615
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,200
And I think that when you're mentioning

616
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,840
that you're maintaining this

617
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,440
the responsibility towards them

618
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,760
and maintaining that communication,

619
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,680
then I think that

620
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,000
that's exactly the inspiration

621
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,960
that I'm looking at

622
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,000
as I'm talking to a lot of others.

623
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,280
Chuck, before we leave,

624
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,280
I want to thank you

625
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,040
for being so generous

626
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,080
with your time,

627
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,600
both here and with Asian Box.

628
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,360
Very funny coincidence that a guest

629
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,640
that is on the show as well,

630
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,640
Aliza Peleg, she's also

631
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,280
a board member of Asian Box,

632
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,280
which just blew my mind.

633
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,240
But it makes perfect sense.

634
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,400
She's a very close friend

635
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,720
and very, very impressive.

636
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,280
And I really want to thank you

637
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,840
for sharing those insights

638
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,640
and that personal experience,

639
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,960
the CEO of a great chain

640
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,760
that is just growing.

641
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,480
And I can't wait to see

642
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,640
where Asian box will continue to grow.

643
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,400
But before we leave,

644
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,600
I have to ask for the most important

645
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,960
and difficult question,

646
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,640
which is three words that you would use

647
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,520
to describe yourself.

648
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,360
Good question.

649
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,680
I think consistent. You know,

650
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,440
whenever you make decisions,

651
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,440
you've got to be consistent.

652
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,400
Just like we want the food

653
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,600
to come out consistently,

654
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,400
that way people know

655
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,280
where they stand

656
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,400
and know what's coming.

657
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,920
I think, you know, right now

658
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,440
evolving and I don't know

659
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,520
if that's the best word,

660
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,920
but we're evolving each day

661
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,560
as to what happens in this industry

662
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,400
and in the world.

663
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,280
And we've got to be able

664
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,760
to change with that

665
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,600
and be open minded that

666
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,640
what you did yesterday

667
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,680
may not be as successful tomorrow

668
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,720
if you're not open to change.

669
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,520
And then,

670
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,520
I don't know, I think communication

671
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,440
once again is a key word.

672
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,160
I don't know if that describes me,

673
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,640
that's more like doing something.

674
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,840
But, you know, I'm very big on communication.

675
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,000
I think It's perfect description.

676
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,720
Yeah. And all the managers

677
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,400
and a lot of our employees,

678
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,720
all the employees have my number.

679
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,920
A lot of them will text

680
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,560
just different ideas,

681
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,880
and that's how we get better.

682
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,160
And that's important.

683
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,280
I appreciate you taking the time

684
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,320
and being a big fan of our company.

685
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:42,840
Wonderful.

686
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,520
Chuck, thank you very, very much.

687
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,680
This is great.

688
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,880
Stay safe and stay healthy.

689
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,600
And I'm looking forward

690
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,560
to seeing you again

691
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,400
around the restaurants.

692
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,680
Likewise. Thanks.
