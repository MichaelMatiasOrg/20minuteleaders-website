Wonderful. Okay. Fatima Zaidi, thank you so much for being on my show. How are you? I'm doing well. Thank you for having me. Of course. Where are you calling from right now? I am currently based out of Toronto. As soon as the pandemic happened, I came back home. Because, well, we have free health care. Very well info now. And some good leadership behind us. So, yeah, we're in good shape down here. Wonderful. But you actually have a long history with Toronto, with the various startups that you've worked with, right? So, have you been on the line between the United States and Toronto often? I would say I was born and raised in the Middle East and I moved to North America when I was just turning 17. And I definitely have spent a large part of my career in Canada. And then this last company that I've started, which is called Quill, it's a one stop shop marketplace for podcasters. So, if you're an indie podcaster, or a company looking to start a show or even outsource elements of your show, we work with companies on indie podcasters to scale through their podcasts. So, right after this, you're going to help me learn how to scale my own podcasts, obviously. I was going to make a joke right at the beginning being like, "Oh, you're recording on a zoom." "I don't want to be too critical here." But no, it's great. I love that you're in university and I love that you're starting a podcast. You're definitely ahead of the hype curve. But just due to the nature of this business, we are more US focused. So, I would say most of the brands that we're working with and we own a conference out in LA. So, I would say that I have been spending the majority of my time the last couple of years based out of different parts of the US. Whether it be Chicago or LA where our event is. But as soon as the pandemic happened, I was on the first flight home. And I'm staying right here until the foreseeable future. I love it. I love it. Okay. Definitely. Definitely. So, what I was saying is that I'd love for you to take me a little bit about back to your journey. You're both named, No, we're fine. You were both named the top 30 marketers by marketing magazine. You share the stage with Richard Branson and places like the Web Summit and other conferences as part of the National Speakers Bureau. So, talk to me a little bit about this dynamic. You were both in marketing. VP business development in various startups. One of them appeared on the Dragon's Den. The Canada version of Shark Tank. So, who are you Fatima? And what drives you to these different endeavors? Yeah, it's a great question. I would say first and foremost, I'm definitely a sales person. So, when I moved to Canada, I didn't really have a dime to my name. But I knew that I wanted to build a life for myself here. It was one of the few countries in the world that I thought could provide you opportunities based on merit and hard work, regardless of the color of your skin and your gender. And so, I'm really glad that I made the decision to move. I worked corporate gigs, while at first I had to put myself to university. So, I did part time at jobs. Got three jobs through school. And eventually graduated debt free and joined the corporate world. And I've always been in sales. And so, the corporate world taught me a lot of the structured processes behind sales. But then, eventually, I moved into the entrepreneurship and startup space where I would help companies scale. And I would say I'm definitely good at marketing because I've worked with tech marketing agencies to scale their companies. But I'm definitely not a marketing expert. I would call myself 100% a sales person. And that is why I started my own company, because I wanted to work on my own bottom line and pipeline rather than somebody else's. So, give me a few of the insights that you've learned about sales over these years. What are some of the key foundational things that excite you about this industry that as a young entrepreneur, I might not even be aware of? Well, being in sales is an emotional rollercoaster. Some days you're, very similar to entry into the startup and entrepreneurship world where some days you feel like you're on the top of the world and some days it's rock bottom. And I think that good sales people realized that they shouldn't be taking these rejections personally. It takes a lot more work getting your ducks in a row than simply managing and to line up and say, I'm hiring for my sales team. I'm always looking for people who are extremely resilient. People who don't feel rejection and people who have the ability to keep putting themselves. Being a salesperson has really trained me to becoming a really great entrepreneur. And essentially it's the same DNA that's required. Right. So, now talk to me a little bit about this latest experience with Quill. What are you trying to do and how are you bringing those sales insights into this new endeavor? So, I was running an agency for a few years where we used to do marketing for a lot of corporate clients. And my job was primarily bringing in the revenue. And I eventually saw a gap in the market where I started seeing a lot of brands were moving into the podcasting space. And so, I decided to productize our services. I sold the agency and launched Quill, which is the world's first marketplace for podcasters. We still have an agency umbrella to the business because a lot of those corporate companies came back and said, "Well, it's great that you have a marketplace and a product. But what we also need is a full service team around us." So, we have both. We have the scalable online technology platform similar to Fiverr and UpWork for podcasting. And then we also have our in-house service team where we do podcasts for big brands along with our conference. And so, that's really the reason that I impetus of why I decided to launch. And we've been working on this company for almost a year now and we launched right before the pandemic. So, that was an interesting experience as well. Launching a company right through the pandemic and then actually scaling during the pandemic was a very interesting experience. So, talk to me a little bit about this world of podcasting. And I've just discovered this in the recent months since covid started. Because I used to go and meet a lot of people that I speak with. I used to meet them for coffee or for walks or go to their offices. All of a sudden covid hits. And I'm like, okay, now I have to do Zoom. Well, actually, when I'm visiting them in the office, it's really weird to just bring a video and then station and then shoot. But if we're on Zoom hitting record, we almost forget that we're recording this right now. We're actually recording an episode right now. It feels much more of a just like a genuine informal conversation. What is happening to podcasts? And how do you see this trajectory? Because it sounds like you build this company right at a beautiful time period where all these Web conferences are taking off and this sharing of information is happening in this medium now. Absolutely. It is definitely the future. And we're really very well positioned in all time. from a launch perspective. Podcasting is definitely on an exponential growth curve where brands are realizing that a lot of their marketing spend and tactics on things like events are no longer applicable. And so, they're looking for additional tactics to spend their money on. And podcasting is definitely, now we're at a million podcasts. 20% of them are active. Actually 200 to 300,000 of those were only added in the last 60 days. So, there's about 4,000 new shows that are popping up every day. So, the growth curve is huge. And we have definitely seen that as soon as we launched, we had brands knocking on our door, asking to be create podcast and create shows. And it's been really interesting because oftentimes, I get asked all the time like, "Is it a saturated community?" "Are there a lot of podcasts out there?" And I always say, "Well, let's compare it to other forms of content. There's six hundred plus million blogs. There's 30 million YouTube channels. There's 1.5 billion websites. When we're looking at podcasting, there's only one million podcasts. And only 20% of those podcasts are active. So, really, there's only 200,000 active podcasts. So, I always say, brands and indeed podcasters who are in this space today are definitely ahead of the hype curve. And very similar to how in the 1980's companies had a phone number for their business and then they had a website and they had social media. Similar to that. I think that in the next five to 10 years, every company and every person will either have a podcast or be advertising on one. Fascinating. Okay, two questions that I have to know the answer to that are now jumping in. First of all, why is it difficult for brands to create podcasts? And why does a brand like Gap need to come to an agency and say, "Hey, can you please help me create this thing with high quality?" That's the first question. The second question is, what are some tangible things the average student like myself that wants to start a podcast, what are some critical things that I need to take in mind, whether it's the technology, the reaching out to people, the sharing of the content? So, those two things I'm just completely fascinated by right now. Yeah, for sure. So, I would say with brands, it's definitely not that hard to create a podcast. I think any brand can do it. But if you're looking for a high production, high quality show that matches the value of your brand, then definitely you can't necessarily, you have to have a lot of different layers of a show. So, you need someone who's good at pre-production. You need someone who's good at content. The technical side, which is the sound engineering, the editing, the recording. And there's the distribution. Then there's the marketing. So, there's just, and guess sourcing. There's just so many different layers to creating a really good show. It's going to be very hard for you to find that in one hire or two hire. So, that is why I think oftentimes if you're on a low budget and you're an indie podcaster, for sure you hire a freelancer to help you. But if you're a brand, oftentimes you're looking for high quality production. You're going to need a team around you. What are the costs that are generally associated with like an indie podcast? So, let's say a friend of mine wants to start a podcast, thinking strategically, what are the associated costs with that? Well, so I would say for an indie podcast, like if you are starting one right now for university, the things to consider is recording platforms. I never recommend that people use Zoom. Because Zoom is a conference line. Not a podcast audio platform. I know we're using it right now and I'm totally turning a blind eye to it. But for example, a platform like Zencastr, which is, I think it's free during covid, otherwise it's $20 a month, it is optimized for sound quality. So, it is actually devised for people who are podcasting. And so, the sound quality is much higher. So that is my first tip as an indie podcaster. Or if you're recording yourself and you don't have budget to spend, record on a platform like Zencastr  or Cleanfeed. Don't use platforms like Anchor, your phone or Skype or Zoom. Because the audio is usually very low in it. Like retention rate would be low. I have to ask, though, because the way that I was approaching this program as well as I'm seeing you, you're seeing me the person is going to view this show, especially on our Facebook page, they're going to have the ability to see us interact on video. And it's almost like watching a TV show. Now, this podcast that we're recording is also going to be on Spotify and Apple podcasts. But I'm seeing the value of the video that in 2020 is something that is increasingly important. Because while I imagine, the audiobooks have been around for a pretty long time, and I've foresee podcast to run for a long time, I know my friends and I, we're looking for the video content that we can see through our phone and through our touch screens. So, do you see that as being an upcoming medium? Or do you still think that the audio part of it is still the most crucial piece? Yeah, so actually, most of our clients, I would say, would like a video component. Because they have YouTube channels that they upload their content on. And so, typically what we do is we record on Zencastr and we have Zoom on mute in the background. So, you're still getting the video, but your audio quality is much higher. So, we actually do a lot of video podcasts as well. The other thing, I'm readying this done for me for the next episode. The other thing I would also, so, yeah, just use Zoom as your video component and just use Zencastr as the audio. The other thing I would say is, Zencastr is coming out with a video component by the end of the summer. I'm actually on the wait list for it. So, it's going to be a watch all in one component. Because they recognize that people do really want the video. And I agree. It's better engagement. We're getting to know each other in a very organic way. And it's hard to bring that to life as much as quickly in an audio consumption format. Okay. So, Fatima, I have to ask because this is the second part of the conversation that I was very excited about. This whole notion of raising capital. How covid has impacted the diversity of founders. Whether it's the gender, or whether it's of color or race. Talk to me a little bit about your insights in regarding to this scene. What has happened before covid in terms of the entrepreneurship scene? And then, how has this been accelerated through covid? So, two things on that. I would say, for starters, I think covid has had a very uneven effect on women because for the most part, a lot of women are on the front line in the service industries right in the heart of the pandemic. And secondly, I think the brunt of unpaid work falls on the majority of women. Whether that's household chores, taking care of your children, taking care of the elderly, which is in itself so difficult when services are closed, schools and daycares are shut. So, I would say if you're a female entrepreneur, I can't even imagine raising or running your company and not only having to reimagine your products and services in the immediate short term and pivot during this pandemic, but also taking care of your children full time, which in itself is a full time job. So, that would be my first thing. I would say that the pre-existing barriers that female founders face before the pandemic are further compounded with things like access to finance, access to mentors and networks and gendered priorities. The second thing I would say is, in reality, there is no pipeline problem when it comes to raising capital. There are a ton of female founders. And in fact, I was reading an article by Business Insider and they said that black female founders, specifically, are the fastest growing population of entrepreneurs. So, investors that are claiming that there are not enough minority female founders to invest in are clearly not looking hard enough. And I think the clog in the pipeline is basically resulting in founders like myself or founders of color, or just female founders in general, not falling into the investors preconceived notion of what a successful entrepreneur constitutes up and what they should look like resulting in two things. Either they become a part of some diversity quota and some minimal charity fund, or we lose the opportunity to somebody who looks more the part. And so, myself included, I was in the process of closing out my seed round right before the pandemic, right up to term sheets. And because of the pandemic, a lot of investors had to pull out and actually ended up being really good for us because we quadrupled our revenue and now don't need investment. But we had to get really creative in the short term to bootstrap our services so that we could stay afloat. And I think a lot of founders in my position who are women are now looking at ways to run their companies without acquiring outside capital. Wow. And is this different than the founders that are male and perhaps, that are not in the minority race? Is that specifically to the group that you're referring to, that you are seeing this behavior? Yeah, I would definitely agree. I mean, I would say that the stats speak for themselves. Like the average deal size for men last year was 12 million. And the average deal size for women was five million. If you look at the average deal size, men have more than double. But like the numbers aren't correlating with the amount of female entrepreneurs in the industry. And that I understand. Right. Like everyone has their personal and conscious and unconscious biases. You essentially want to invest in people that look more like you. And at the top level of investments, it's mostly white males. And so, I think part of the problem is that investing companies, angels and VCs need to start making sure that their partners map that of the general demographic. And if they don't, then they need to put in selection blinds to remove their biases. But, yeah, I mean, in the meantime, I think definitely women are going to have a really tough time bouncing back from this experience that we're going through. Wow. Well, I'm definitely going to remain optimistic in the end. And hopefully, it's not as dire. But it sounds incredible that you were about to close the seed round after the term sheets, covid hits, and now you've quadrupled revenues. And not just the fact that your valuation is probably much higher than it was. But now you're saying that you're profitable and you don't need to raise the next investments. Talk to me a little bit about this National Speakers Bureau. Why public speaking? Why getting on stages and sharing information, sharing stories? Why do you do that? I was approached by BNN Bloomberg to start doing segments and contribution columns on topics that were really extremely important to me. And actually, diversity and inclusion is one of the main topics that I talk about. Especially within the tech sector. And so, I've just always been really passionate about moving the dial. Like moving to North America in itself was moving the dial for me. Because I grew up in a very Middle Eastern culture, which is very different from what I've experienced here. And so, I really wanted to share not only my experience, but how we can continue moving forward from a diversity and inclusive efforts and what companies need to be doing to support entrepreneurs. And so, I would say, that's more my area of expertise, along with tech and media trends for sure. But I really enjoy public speaking. I mean, obviously, things have been put on a halt right now with conferences and events being on hold. But I've always really enjoyed speaking to people. Really sharing a lot of insights, and it's more so 360s than feedback has always been very mutual. And I would say, public speaking is definitely not for everyone. But I just been one of the lucky. I think I'm an extrovert. So, it's worked really well for me. But it's just one of those tactics that I chose to build my personal brand. And it worked really well for me. First of all, I want to thank you again for being so generous with your time. It's been really inspiring to hear both about your insights about the tech ecosystem and the financial side of it and the raising capital, but also in the podcasting side. And I definitely took some notes for myself on how to improve for the next 200 episodes of the series. But before we leave, I have to put you on the spot one time and ask you a personal question. And I'd love to know three words that you would use to describe yourself or that any of your colleagues would use to describe you or anybody listening to you on stage, how would they describe you. Yeah. So, a good and bad, I want to try to be as objective as possible. I would say I am definitely, I have a lot of hustle. I think it's the DNA of all entrepreneurs. We know it's 95% perspiration and 5% inspiration. So, definitely hustle is something that I would say. A little bit insane. Crazy or insane would definitely be a word that I would use to describe myself. It's a combination of just like, having a very crystallized dream and focus in life and just working tirelessly towards it. And so, sometimes I think that that can translate into a type of intensity that maybe doesn't resonate with everyone. And I'm okay with that. And I would say, the third one is, oh, my goodness, I'm like, it's so hard to narrow down the third one. I hate talking about myself in that way. That's why it's the hardest question. Yeah. It is a really hard question. You've got me there. You've stumped me. I would probably say the last one would be resilience. Yeah. I would say that I'm just somebody that like, because I don't know if it's because I've been in sales or where I've come from, but just keep getting knocked down, keep getting back up. So, I don't take no for an answer. Don't ask, don't get policy. So, yeah, I would say hustle, resilience and a little bit of crazy. Which I think every needs. One of the main things that a lot of VCs on this show have been telling me is that, one of the skills they consider most important as you're starting your entrepreneurial career, is actually to boost sales. And to understand what it's like to get rejected ten times, to only get one client. And getting back up and being able to deliver a message clearly and concisely so that it also impacts the other person and not just yourself. With this note, I need to send you off to your next meeting [--] But thank you very very much for the time. This was fantastic. And I'll definitely get back to you on the new technologies that I'm going to use. I've already wrote them down for me. Sounds good. Let me know. Happy podcasting, Michael. Thank you. Thank you very much. Take care. Bye.
