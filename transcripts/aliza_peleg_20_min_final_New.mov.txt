1 Getting ready to have a shower to go for my morning meeting and I open the suitcase and I say, "Holy shit, whose?" And you see a clown suit. And I see, I'm the idiot. I always wondered who are the idiots that take someone else's suitcase? Then I would said, "Shit, it's me." Aliza Peleg, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Good morning. Hi, good morning. Great to be with you. It's fantastic to have you here. First off, so we know each other for many, many years. We were recently reintroduced through J-Ventures. But the very first thing that I saw about you is that you are a board member of Asian Box, which, like I mentioned to you, is one of my favorite restaurants of all time, based in California. So, thank you for making it happen and for allowing me to have such a great meal. Obviously, it's just one of many, many things that you're doing. I can't wait to talk about your career and some of the insights that you've gained. Give me a second, just give a brief introduction as to some of the incredible things you've done and then I'll let you take it from there. But starting out as a developer relations for the Mac platform all the way back in '91 with Apple, to being a managing director at SAP, to head of Global Planning and Operations at Better Place, one of the most revolutionary and innovative companies that spun out of Israel with this great support of Shimon Peres. Chief operating officer of PlanetSoho, GM at NICE, chief operating officer at Reali, and now board members of both Ayehu Software and Asian Box. Aliza, incredible, incredible career. But before we get into that, you mentioned you have a fun story to share with me. Well, first of all, thank you for that great introduction. And it just shows you how many years I go back. And I have to thank you for being a loyal customer of Asian Box. It's been tough during the covid season and trying to keep the service going and feeding our amazing customers with this very fresh and organic and gluten free food is indeed a challenge. But we've been rewarded by the phenomenal support of our customers. And keep it up and spread the word. And we love your support. So, thanks a million. And that's really probably the only thing that I've done in my career, which is not tech or software related. So, it's an interesting, it's a wonderful phenomena. As for an interesting story, I'm sure that there are tons. The one that comes to my mind is that I actually had a breakfast meeting with a CFO of a Fortune 500 with my pajamas. How does that happen? How does that happen? So, one of those 5am flights, that means you leave your house at 2:00 in the morning and you pack a suitcase, and I fly quite often, so, I fly what I call in my pajamas. Which is just the worst sweats, the most comfortable T-shirt and sneakers, and just to be able to sleep in the flight. And this is pre business class where they give you pajamas. This is sitting in coach with my own T-shirt and sweats. And I fly for a meeting in the morning with the CFO. And I land at the airport, and I didn't believe this would ever happen to me, I took someone else's suitcase. Wow. Which looks exactly like mine. I travel an hour to the hotel getting ready to have a shower, to go for my morning meeting. And I open the suitcase and I say, "Holy shit, whose?" And you see a clown suit. And I see, I'm the idiot. I always wondered who are the idiots that take someone else's suitcase? And I would said, "Shit, it's me." And it was horrific. Aliza, I always wonder who is that person? Who is the idiot that didn't check? It was exactly the same color, the exact same size. The good news is, it had a phone number. I called the guy and I said, "Joe, I have your stuff. Don't freak out." He obviously left my suitcase at the airport. I immediately called the cab. It cost me one hundred euros each direction to just to drop the other suitcase and come back with mine. But there was no time for the meeting. And I just went in my pajamas, with my sneakers, with this crappy old T-shirt, and I walked into this beautiful, immaculate office. The guy was wearing a white starred shirt with a beautifully tied tie. And I said, "I'm sorry. I'm in pajamas." That's my story. Wonderful. Wonderful. And I amazingly we're into the phenomenal career that you've had. Most interestingly, if I'm looking at this amazing list, I'm seeing a lot of vision. And we talked about this very briefly before we started. I'm seeing companies that are really revolutionizing whatever industry they're in. And one of the things that I'm learning to appreciate both through Stanford and J-Ventures, is that most companies, especially in tech, are not necessarily visionary or revolutionary. A lot of them are nice. They're great. They're building upon predecessors. But here I'm seeing a good cohort of companies that are really trying to break the mold and do something else. Talk to me a little bit about why you're attracted to these visionary companies. Yeah. That's great. It's true. My career does span across very small companies and very big companies, startups and innovative and not so startup and innovators. So, it's true that I have been around, but I am really attracted to the visionaries. And I think what led me to it was sort of one thing to the other. I'm not a visionary as myself. I think that my strengths have always been around execution and operation and progress and sort of connecting the organization and grounding the organization to the founders vision. So, I think I found myself teaming up with entrepreneurs that have a phenomenal vision, but don't necessarily know how to connect that vision into day to day execution by a team that's focused, that's functioning, and that allows them to really and truly realize their vision. And I think being in that environment of entrepreneurship and when we really, really fighting for existence on a daily basis, yet we can't just stay in the clouds. And vision without execution is actually not going to be a great way to succeed. It takes a lot of honesty and courage and maturity to come and say, I don't see myself as somebody that's visionary, but I know that my strengths are connecting the dots when you take somebody with a vision and what needs to happen in order to get to that vision. And I really, it inspires me because I think that, especially growing around the community that mean that you sort of expect every young entrepreneur to be visionary and all do it yourself and you can do everything. And having that honesty and the courage to say these are things that I'm good at, these are things that I'm not good at and I want to capitalize on what I'm really good at. And for you, that's the role of the chief operating officer. I haven't had the pleasure of having too many COOs on the show, not nearly, especially with the background that you have here. What is the role of the operating officer within both a small startup and the larger organization? That's great. And I also want to, before I go into the details, I'll also explain and maybe that's a fun fact, too, it wasn't only that I necessarily chose that or understood that quickly early on, I think I might have demonstrated early on and entrepreneurs discovered that in me and pulled me into it more than I said, "This is what I do well." I did work with an entrepreneur without mentioning names who started the second company and wanted me to join and I said, "You know what? I need a little bit of time off between, I'll wait a while and I'll join you later." And his answer to me, "No worries. I'm going to start now. You can join whenever you want. I just want to make sure that the later you start, the more you'll have to clean up." And then I said, "Okay. I'll see you Monday morning." And that was the end of my time off. Because I think he coined it better than I. That's beautiful. So, not so nice way to describe it, is to clean up the founders or the entrepreneurs or the visionaries shit. That's one part of the job. One way of describing it. A nice way of describing it is really to try and get the machinery going, really to try and get a rhythm, right? That there's a rhythm of planning and executing and measuring, learning from it, moving on, planning again, executing, measuring and learning. So, it's something to keep the organization accountable to we know what we're doing, we're doing it. And we said we would do it, we're doing it. And we said we did it. And then we move on. And have the ability to sort of get that into some kind of a spirit without being too bureaucratic, without being too slow. But if you don't measure and if you don't really understand and if you don't learn, you can get off track really, really quickly and sort of forget where you started. And sometimes the vision is so far out. And this vector, you have to sort of be quite sure on the vector and now, it's okay to pivot, it's okay to change, it's okay to go in a zigzag. But I believe in conscious zigzag. And in understanding and proactive zigzag versus reactive. I love that. So, do you see a very big difference between the chief operating officer of a startup and that of a large company? Because I'm sure it's two different worlds, right? On one hand, you're talking about potentially cleaning after that visionary's mess. And obviously, it's not because they're messy, but it's because part of the role requires that they do run quickly and they try different things, they break things. And you need to have that figure that comes and says, okay, let's put some order here and make sure that we're aligning to our vision. So, what are the sort of the distinctions between the two? Well, first there are distinctions. And I just hope, for the sake of clarity, I wasn't the COO in large companies, in larger companies, I was more a GM or a managing director of a big unit. So, that was more of an overall business leadership role, either a line of business. You know, NICE, I managed the 200 million dollar line of business. Or let's say, I was the head of, I was the managing director of SAP Labs in the US, which was the largest lab outside of Germany. And I also led the lab network, which was seven labs outside of Germany. So, that was a different kind of an operating. So, that's an operating role. But it's not the COO. In the startup world, I think it really depends. It's not appropriate for a startup with seven people in the garage. Right? And you're just figuring out your product and you don't really have product market fit, and you're still breaking things, that's not really when you have a COO. But when you've developed a product, and we'll talk about Better Place separately. Because that was really from day one, we were three people in the company. Really? It started in my living room. We ran the company for six months out of my house. That's a different. We'll talk about that. But if we talk about the general level of startups, you know, if you have been mainly in the software world, so, if you're six, five or six people developing a small or a huge product, but it's just the beginning and you're breaking and you're not sure. But once you start, and when you say the word scaling, it's scary because you can scale it hundreds of millions. You can also scale from five people to 15 people. But if you understand that you're lacking some huge capabilities around people management, process management, go to market management. So, this is becoming a little bit more functions that are beyond the development, the COO is not the only guy who's doing the sales. Right. And either the CEO or the founding team, take this upon themselves. They really understand. We need to start thinking about our go-to-market. We need to think about hiring. We need to think about culture. We need to think about processes. If they have that kind of talent, then there's no need for a COO at early stages. But when you need when you feel, you know, one guy is really the architect and the other guy is the head of the development, then one guy can sort of talk to investors and everything else is falling apart in the process, in the machinery, in the hiring, in the HR, in finance, then you start thinking about, is there a person who can aggregate all the sort of stuff together and run it. And then if you start going to customer success and you have support, then you have got to, so, the more functions you go, depends very much on the composition and the talent of the founders. That's fascinating. Aliza, I have to hear the founding of Better Help out of your living room. I can't imagine anybody listening to this who doesn't know what Better Help is. Better Place, sorry. Better Place. Alon Matas from Palo Alto is a great friend and I've been talking to him a lot. And Better Help is also a fantastic company, also a phenomenal company. But better place is remarkable because it really is innovation through necessity. A revolutionary story within Israel, of course, with the late Shimon Peres as a huge supporter. And I remember growing up, I think I was maybe 13, 14 when it was, when I started seeing it roll out in the big headlines. And really what people were excited about was how revolutionary it was. And here you have some really courageous people with a very courageous leader in the government that are running together to really change the way we think about consuming fuel and how cars run on the road and moving to a green planet. Talk to me a little bit about Better Place. First of all, it's amazing that you know so much about it. And you were a young boy and it's great that you spoke so beautifully about the company. You should have been part of our team, probably even when you were 12 or 13 years old. So, that's great. It was absolutely a phenomenal experience. Unfortunately, it crashed badly. And there's a whole session. And I actually ran a small case study at Stanford for 5 years. Yes. I run an annual case about the rise and fall of Better Place. Wow. But an incredible, incredible leader and a phenomenal visionary. And we can all talk about the billion dollar crash. I wanted for a second, put a plug in there. I think that Shai Agassi, the founder, the visionary and the leader, I would say, probably, single handedly, pushed the industry to a point that that's why we see so many EVs around the world. The system didn't work. The change didn't work, we made a lot of mistakes or the vision wasn't 100% right. But if I can give credit to him, the single largest credit that I can give him is that I think that he single handedly pushed the industry in his confidence, in his arrogance in his lack of humility, he walked into the heads of all the auto makers and said, "If you don't do EVs, you're going to die." In 2007, we went to the Frankfurt Auto Show and there wasn't one EV on the floor or even a prototype or even a demo car or nothing. By 2010 or 11, there wasn't a manufacturer in the entire world that didn't have an EV story or an EV platform or an EV strategy or something. And then I think, Shai himself and Better Place as his wing, I think really, really moved that. Even Elon Musk at that time, who was already close to delivering the Roadster and delivered the Roadster, even at that time, didn't publicly say, I don't want to take away from his vision at all, that entire world should move to EV. He was demonstrating that if you were a Porche lover, you can do that with an EV. And EV is not a golf cart. And you can have the best and fastest and greatest car. But mass consumption, mass scale, no one spoke about. And Shai really believe that that could happen. The reason in Better Place, there was a head of operations from day one because that was a huge undertaking. It was obvious that Shai would be outbound. Government's, financing regulations, big outbound activities, would have zero attention and also less capability, but mainly zero attention into the company. So, the entire processes of starting to build the team from scratch. And wasn't [--] so many dimensions. Because not only the product was complicated from software and hardware and batteries and all the physics and all the capabilities of hardware, go-to-market, the global expansion, the regulations, managing the finance, managing the people, making the legalities right that we knew would be incredibly difficult from day one. So, we started with that structure that we would move forward with. I think that's remarkable. And I think sometimes we tend to forget that everybody has 24 hours in a day. I remember that a few months ago, somebody mentioned to me, we were talking about the presidency of the United States and we're talking about how busy they must be and the different things they get done. And then he said, "You know, the president also has 24 hours in the day. They also need to sleep for at least five or six of them. And so we're not very different." I think it's sometimes, it's easy to forget that you can't have one person who just does it all who is both a visionary, outbound, inbound. And you need to have those different processes in place and be very honest about them. Be very intentional about them. You used the word intentionality and the zigzagging in the operations in the beginning of this discussion. And I love that word. And I take it to heart and I'm very excited as I go on my entrepreneurial journey to remind myself to continuously be intentional about what I'm doing, who I'm doing it with and why I'm doing it. But Aliza, tell me a little bit about being a part of this team that is really educating the market, educating governments and really going against the grain at a time where no other manufacturing company in Frankfurt is showing any interest in it. What is that like? Well, it was great, it was tough, it was excruciating, difficult, but and it was also rewarding. But it also had its challenges, which eventually led to, I believe, our demise. Because when the gap between your vision and execution is widening instead of closing, and also between the story that you tell others and the story that you tell yourself. So, at some point, I will get to it a little bit later, but, it was huge. Because we raised a lot of money and because they were true phenomenal believers behind it, we could tell a real great story. And you need a story in order to drag people, governments, countries. So, you need a phenomenal story. And we had that. We had the money and we had good storytellers. And I think that creates a very positive momentum. And sometimes it's really hard when I think of small startups who have a great story and they don't have the money or the bandwidth or the capability to actually tell it. We sort of had, we had the privilege to tell a huge story and the means to tell it loudly, loudly and beautifully. So, at the beginning, you actually, the momentum and the motivation just coming from the success of the stories that there's so many people listening and so many people buying into it. So, it's misleading sometimes. You get carried away. You drink your own Kool-Aid, which is a problem in of itself. But that's how you get going. You sort of really have to create this positive cycle of you tell the story, people buy the story. Then you tell people that you told the story. And we also hired phenomenal people. And our team in Israel, which was led by Kaplinsky, they was amazing. And their execution capability, both in the operation, building out the stations, building out the prototypes, getting the call to work in R&D, an R&D team that I think work more than 24 hours a day, I have to admit. So, I think there was a lot of small successes and progress. I wouldn't call it small, that's not fair. I think they were huge progresses in certain domains that helped us believe that we're making great progress. But actually, with such a company, all the chain is huge. There are many links in the chain and you're only as strong as your weakest link. And the fact that some links were missing doesn't help the story. That takes time to figure out. And unfortunately, at some point, I did feel that I can't contribute anymore. I can't really fulfill my role as I should. And I decided to leave. Very courageous. I can't believe that it's spun out of your living room. And one of the first three people. I remember actually, I was very, I still am a very, very good friends with one of the Shai children, Jonathan. And we spent many, many, many weekends at their house. Shai is also a fantastic poker player. And he taught us a lot about his skills. And we were very passionate about the behavioral economics behind it. And during the games, he would tell us a lot of stories and a lot of inspiration. And when I'm thinking back to, why I'm so excited about technology and why I was so excited as a kid following this journey, I think that was a huge part of it. Seeing also from the background, It's real. It's not just in the headlines, in the papers. And the challenges are really tangible. And at the end, everybody's just a human being. And we try to move the needle. And I'm sure that you have such incredible fulfillment from knowing that you really did move the needle. And it's one of Israel's most courageous innovative stories ever since its founding. I think it's just remarkable. Aliza, I want to thank you for being so generous with your time. 20 minutes go by very, very quickly. But unfortunately, the show is called 20 Minute Leaders. I should have called it an hour minute leaders. But before we leave, I have to ask you the most difficult question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself and feel free to answer however you feel. Well, maybe I can be a little bit generous with the definition of three. Like a good Israeli and negotiate with you. There you go. Yeah, I think. Wow, that's hard. I'll take a stab and I'm sure it's not the real or the only, I'm sure. But it's the ones that come to mind, I think that, not necessarily in order of priority, I think is, in a not self-proclaiming way But I think it's something about, integrity and authenticity would be my first in terms of I really do speak my mind. Sometimes people don't even like it. But I really, really speak my mind and I walk my talk. I try very hard to walk my talk. So, I think the second one which might be related is courage. And the courage is, it's not the same courage as the visionary. It's not the courage of thinking how I'm going to change the world. It's not that kind of courage. But it's definitely the courage of being with people like that, not knowing necessarily a way payroll will come tomorrow. So, dealing with the fears and uncertainties of a startup, that's an easier courage. The courage that I think that I present is I see [--] ramifications of me doing the right thing. My beliefs about doing the right thing, whatever ramifications will bring, I think that's courage. And I wouldn't have known that but I've heard people tell me that. So, I think, that's a kind of courage, you know, knowing that if this will get you into trouble, you may lose your job, you may fall out of favor with someone. But I think there's something. It was wonderful until now. Aliza, the walking the talk, it's I think, not enough people do it. And I think it's that courage of actually executing on your intentions. And we talked about being intentional a lot. And I loved when you brought up the walk the talk with that first word with integrity, because its own world in itself. And I think that, knowing somebody that you can trust, that you can trust that person, and that you can really believe that they'll do whatever they say they'll do, not necessarily that they'll do it right or 100%, but that they'll actually be intentional in doing it, to me, that's what trust is about. That's what partnership is about. So, if it's okay with you, I'll take that as the third word. Oh, great. I actually wanted to add a different one, but I'm happy to. It's a derivative, but that's perfect. That's perfect. I love it. Aliza, thank you very, very much. This was inspiring and thoughtful and a lot more. So, thank you for giving me the time. And I look forward to keeping in touch. Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity. It's been a lot of fun. And now you owe me a cup of coffee.
