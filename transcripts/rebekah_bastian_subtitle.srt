00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,600
Rebekah Bastian,

2
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
thank you for being on my show.

3
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
How are you?

4
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,160
I'm good. Thanks for having me.

5
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,880
You're calling from Seattle, right?

6
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,920
That's right.

7
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,720
Oh, wonderful. Wonderful.

8
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,560
So, I can't wait to hear

9
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,320
about your journey

10
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,720
all the way from your college years,

11
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,760
to becoming a VP at Zillow

12
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,320
after 15 years of being there,

13
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,560
both of product and community.

14
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,680
And I'd love to understand

15
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,800
how the two things are turned to one,

16
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,520
because both of them

17
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,840
seem so crucial today.

18
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,440
Especially as community people,

19
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,000
we have been talking

20
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,040
about building a community

21
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,600
within culture, within companies

22
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,800
for so long.

23
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,600
So, I'd love to hear about this journey

24
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,720
all the way to writing a book,

25
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,520
Blaze Your Own Trail,

26
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,760
and to founding a company.

27
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,400
Way too much to go over in 20 minutes,

28
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,960
but we'll try.

29
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,720
Rebekah, take me back

30
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,400
to your college days.

31
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,080
Because you actually have

32
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,480
a pretty interesting story

33
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,800
starting from your college days.

34
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,120
So, I think I went to five colleges total.

35
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,600
Wow.

36
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,400
Yeah. The first one was

37
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,120
a small liberal arts school in high school,

38
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,960
and I actually failed out of that.

39
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,920
And I went for music.

40
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,880
And just wasn't feeling it at the time.

41
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,040
I guess, I couldn't get my act together.

42
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,560
And then after that,

43
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,640
I moved up to Seattle with an ex-boyfriend

44
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,880
and after working for the year,

45
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,640
ended up enrolling

46
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,560
in the community college.

47
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,800
I change a couple of different colleges here

48
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,600
and then transferred into

49
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,560
University of Washington for undergrad.

50
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,800
I did mechanical engineering

51
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,520
and then ultimately ended up

52
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,680
also getting my masters

53
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,720
in mechanical engineering

54
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,960
from UC Berkeley.

55
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,320
So, a lot of educational transfers.

56
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,000
Right. So, on one hand you're saying

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,320
an entrepreneur and a published author,

58
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,360
a VP at Zillow, one of the most

59
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,640
well respected companies in startups

60
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,640
in the United States and the world.

61
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,960
Going to five different colleges

62
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,440
and failing out of the first one.

63
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,880
What was that about?

64
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,040
What happened there?

65
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,080
Well, you know, I think

66
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,760
it's all part of the winding path.

67
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,920
That's something that

68
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,440
I've certainly lived my whole life

69
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,400
and it hasn't been linear.

70
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,160
And it hasn't always been intentional,

71
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,680
even you know where I ended up.

72
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,720
But that's what I think

73
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,920
is important to talk about.

74
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,240
And I think when you dig deeper,

75
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,600
a lot of people that you might think

76
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,880
are in successful places in their lives,

77
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,680
it turns out that it's not always linear.

78
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,720
And I think that

79
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,240
being authentic about that

80
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,920
is like so many times when we're

81
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,440
in one of those rough patches

82
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,440
or screwing something up

83
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,440
or something's not good,

84
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,280
we take a look around and we see

85
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,960
what seems like a bunch of really

86
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,160
polished end results.

87
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,840
We can feel like we're getting it wrong

88
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,040
because of that whining.

89
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,800
So, it's one of the things

90
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,720
I've tried to do

91
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,480
in the conversations I have

92
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,520
and now what we're building with OwnTrail

93
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,080
is really embracing that winding journey.

94
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,880
Because it's not wrong. It leads to

95
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,450
some really interesting places.

96
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,120
Amazing. Okay.

97
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,880
So, before we go on to this winding path,

98
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,000
non-linear career pathways

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,040
and overall mentorship within OwnTrail,

100
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,240
I'd love to talk a little bit

101
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,280
about your experience with Zillow.

102
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,640
Zillow, it's one of my favorite companies.

103
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,560
I mean, I loved the transition

104
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,080
that's happened.

105
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,240
And back at Stanford,

106
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,120
I actually spent quite a meaningful time

107
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,600
with some of the machine learning teams

108
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,680
to understand a little bit better

109
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,560
about this estimate

110
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,680
and what's happening there.

111
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,640
But I'd love to hear

112
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,720
what was it like spending 15 years

113
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,240
at a fast growing company,

114
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,400
going to be a VP of product

115
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,160
and VP of community?

116
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,760
So, talk to me about the whole experience,

117
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,160
but then also these two positions

118
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
that you held.

119
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,120
Yeah, I mean, so the answer is super fun.

120
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,320
I was one of the first employees

121
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,920
as a stealth startup when I started there.

122
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,920
And which is exciting in and of itself,

123
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,680
looking back at that again now

124
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,480
in a different path.

125
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,520
We grew in some really meaningful ways.

126
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,440
Also not totally but we tried somethings.

127
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,040
Made some different turns

128
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,880
in what we were building and how.

129
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,360
But a lot of it was just,

130
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,480
we had guiding in the beginning

131
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,880
in a really meaningful space

132
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,800
to be working in around housing.

133
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,680
And it was really fun

134
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,240
to grow with the company.

135
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,360
And when I started there,

136
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,960
I went as program manager

137
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,400
for a couple of few years before that,

138
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
but I was still pretty junior

139
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,160
in my career.

140
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,400
And so I started as,

141
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,280
pretty junior program manager.

142
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,960
And then kept saying yes to things

143
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,960
and raising my hand and trying new things.

144
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,760
And working on a lot of different areas

145
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,680
of the product.

146
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,200
And starting initiatives and groove

147
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,080
into the VP of product role

148
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,760
and loved that.

149
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,480
It was really fun.

150
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,880
But then, what I ended up doing

151
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,400
after a while and all the time

152
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,480
I started taking on

153
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,760
just a lot of side projects

154
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
that were really aligned

155
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,680
with what I was passionate about.

156
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,360
So, that was really thinking about

157
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,200
how we create social impact

158
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
in the people building

159
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,840
and how we create more diversity

160
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,200
in our tech work.

161
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,760
And how we have this great culture

162
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,000
from the beginning organically.

163
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,120
And how do we foster that

164
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,640
as we really grow into a bigger company.

165
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,880
What are some of the biggest memories

166
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
that you've had?

167
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,440
If you look at those 15 years,

168
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,160
some of those like the big aha moments

169
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,560
or highlights that you've had

170
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,880
within this incredible startup.

171
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,120
Well, I think the biggest thing

172
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,880
is the friendships.

173
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,480
I ended up with just one friends there

174
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,320
and really incredible people

175
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,600
that I have the honor of working with.

176
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,200
The mobile apps are really cool

177
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,320
that we took on as a side project

178
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,640
when the iPhone first came out.

179
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,360
And we worked with some developers

180
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,480
on what would be Zillow's first mobile app

181
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
and we just did it on the side

182
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,360
for about a year.

183
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,560
And It really took off.

184
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,120
And ultimately I ended up

185
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,720
getting to be the first product manager

186
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,560
for our mobile initiatives.

187
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,900
And really leading a lot of that.

188
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,720
And that was really exciting.

189
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,280
And then, yes,

190
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,720
starting the community culture team

191
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,400
was really exciting.

192
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,200
Because that was a brand new team

193
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,280
and a new initiative as well.

194
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,160
That was really all of my passion

195
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,680
into an entire new area of my career.

196
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,520
So, what does entail the role of the VP

197
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,400
of the culture and community?

198
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,320
So, the way that, basically,

199
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,440
I created this vision

200
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,240
for what that team would look like

201
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,680
and was able to hire

202
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,640
[--] around it.

203
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,680
And the vision was really

204
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,280
it had equity and belonging at its core.

205
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,640
So, from the ground up,

206
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,800
it was really about creating

207
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,400
equitable opportunities

208
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,760
and just like as if they belong

209
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,560
in the workplace.

210
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,240
And from there, layering on.

211
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,040
Like the ways that we culturally engage

212
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,600
with each other and in our communities.

213
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,840
From there, really thinking about

214
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,800
how we can be leveraging

215
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,880
people's unique skills and passions

216
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,320
to solve bigger social issues

217
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,720
for our business and products.

218
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,040
So, there's a little bit distractions

219
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,040
based on my background and skills.

220
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,720
But it was really

221
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,120
just incredible learning curve,

222
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,480
incredible opportunity

223
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,760
to make a difference

224
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,960
in the organization.

225
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,240
And I was able to hire an amazing team

226
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,480
that I really learned a lot from.

227
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,000
So, the idea was that

228
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,560
as VP of culture and community,

229
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,200
this was internal within Zillow,

230
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,040
how do you foster

231
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,960
creative collaboration within Zillow.

232
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,600
So, what are some insights

233
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,520
can you share with me as an entrepreneur,

234
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,000
or my friends who are watching this,

235
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,680
about creating a sustainable

236
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,960
and healthy culture

237
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,440
within a diverse community?

238
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,320
And obviously today and throughout 2020,

239
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,680
this whole notion of diversity

240
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,480
and acceptance and culture

241
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,000
has been so monumental

242
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,520
to all of our lives and for everyone here.

243
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,560
So, what are some things that you learned

244
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,360
throughout these years at Zillow

245
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,480
that I can take on with me?

246
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,760
A lot of our philosophy behind

247
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,480
how we build and structure this,

248
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
none of this work is something

249
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,880
that can be carried out

250
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,280
and done by a single team

251
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,120
or by a few people.

252
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,080
It really need to be part

253
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,560
of the company's culture.

254
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,040
And so, we're really focused

255
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,920
on creating pathways

256
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,840
for engagement for employees.

257
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,360
So, it's really saying like,

258
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,720
fortunately we didn't have the problem

259
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,160
and we get people excited about this work.

260
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,120
Enthusiastic employee base

261
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,840
who really wanted to do the right thing.

262
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,160
That was part of our core values

263
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,680
and people really believe that.

264
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,360
And so, it was more about

265
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,920
like in the past, for people to use

266
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,680
their unique skills and their passions.

267
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,800
And get involved in the way

268
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,040
that feels right to them

269
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,400
in order to keep everything

270
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,280
from just everyone learning how to find

271
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,640
the equity lines to the business

272
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,680
that they're doing.

273
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,240
To get involved with

274
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,440
leading our finished works

275
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,760
or culture committees.

276
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,440
Or working on social impact products.

277
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,920
Or all these different pathways

278
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,560
for people to do that.

279
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,640
And I think that's a methodology

280
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,560
that probably applies

281
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,120
to different companies.

282
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,760
But also a lot of

283
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,760
different community efforts.

284
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,680
And any time you have

285
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,320
a group of people that change,

286
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,240
then it's about creating those pathways

287
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,960
to do so in a way

288
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,360
that really brings people together

289
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,880
to create that change.

290
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,720
Wonderful. Okay.

291
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,480
So, you go and you write your own book.

292
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,360
And it's a different type of book, right?

293
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,400
It's not just starting in page one

294
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,680
and finishing on the last page

295
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,080
and reading through the whole thing.

296
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,960
It kind of jump around.

297
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,320
Talk to me a little bit about this book

298
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,240
and how that inspired you to then create

299
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,680
your own venture, own trail.

300
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,000
Yeah. So, the book,

301
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,440
Blaze Your Own Trail,

302
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,560
it's an interactive exploration

303
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,760
of women's life paths.

304
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,100
And so, it uses the

305
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,600
you can choose your own journey format,

306
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,960
which is to choose

307
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,080
your own adventure books.

308
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,160
And which means that you, the reader,

309
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,960
are the person going through the story.

310
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,320
And you make a decision

311
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,240
at the end of each chapter,

312
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,200
and it gets you to the next.

313
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,960
So, essentially the whole table

314
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,160
of contents is the stake decision tree.

315
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,560
And there's all these different pathways,

316
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
there's 19 different endings.

317
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,640
19?

318
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,120
Yeah.

319
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,560
19 different endings to a book?

320
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,640
Yeah.

321
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,520
I have to say that I just finished

322
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,960
writing a book myself

323
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,680
that will be published

324
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,760
hopefully next week or the week after.

325
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,400
And I could barely think of one ending.

326
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,280
So, I can't even imagine

327
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,400
what it's like to think of a 19.

328
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,800
And it's a non-fiction,

329
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,440
so it should have been pretty easy.

330
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,560
Well, congrats on finishing the book.

331
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,000
That's super exciting.

332
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,040
Yeah, I think coming from that,

333
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,880
that product manager happened.

334
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,720
I think, thinking [--]

335
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,280
is kind of natural.

336
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,800
It's great.

337
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
But yeah, it's really fun.

338
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,960
It's really, it's trying to create

339
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,600
the experience

340
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,340
of different decisions we make

341
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,680
[--] as women.

342
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,960
And it leaves a lot of data

343
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,760
into it as well.

344
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,320
So, it is this fictional plot line.

345
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,640
But with data you're really creating

346
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,920
that sense of solidarity,

347
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,360
I think that might feel

348
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,320
like they're less common

349
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:22,960
because they don't

350
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,280
get talked about as much.

351
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,800
But in fact, there's some

352
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,120
really shared experiences in there.

353
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,640
And it create a solidarity of knowing

354
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,160
that we're all going through

355
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,800
a lot of similar things and that,

356
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,880
while oftentimes

357
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,360
the outcomes of our decisions

358
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,840
aren't what we necessarily thought

359
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,680
we wanted, we can be okay.

360
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,320
And we can find our happiness through

361
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,520
all the different twists and turns.

362
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,480
So, how long did this whole process take

363
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,440
from this idea of the

364
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,160
Blaze Your Own Trail,

365
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,040
until the day that it got published?

366
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,760
So, I wrote the first draft

367
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,680
in about five months.

368
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,160
And around the time,

369
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,600
shortly before I was finishing

370
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,120
the first draft,

371
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,440
is when I signed a contract

372
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,160
with my publisher.

373
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,200
And they were amazing.

374
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,480
I had my editor there

375
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,760
and it was really incredible

376
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,840
and the whole team was really incredible.

377
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,440
So, I had a really

378
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,600
positive experience with that.

379
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,560
So, [--] it came out,

380
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,240
was a year.

381
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,160
Now, during that year,

382
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,840
it's for all the different editing

383
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,400
and rewriting stuff.

384
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,520
And then there was a waiting period

385
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,960
and the period basically,

386
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
when OwnTrail is born.

387
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,040
I started thinking about

388
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
how I might create

389
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
what I thought would be

390
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,320
a book launch website.

391
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,300
Maybe something else,

392
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,040
trails that different women have place.

393
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,720
But it ended up really

394
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,120
taking on a life of its own

395
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,040
pretty quickly.

396
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,800
And we really found some important thing

397
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,480
and some big ideas for solving them

398
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,040
around what mentorship

399
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,200
has traditionally looked like.

400
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,520
And what it could look like

401
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,840
if we were able to scale it.

402
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,520
I and countless other women

403
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,320
get asked to go to coffee,

404
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,120
and share what our journey has been

405
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,520
by young women who really want

406
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,560
to hear those experiences and get advice.

407
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,680
And it just it doesn't scale.

408
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,560
We can't say yes to everybody.

409
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,760
And oftentimes we as women,

410
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,680
and especially women who hold

411
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,760
different multiple identities,

412
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,680
don't always have people

413
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,800
in our immediate purview

414
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,200
that look like us.

415
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,800
And that can be really valuable to see.

416
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,040
And so, what we're doing

417
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,320
is really creating a scalable platform

418
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,560
that is an aggregate

419
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,040
of what we call micro acts of mentorship.

420
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,960
Which is women

421
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,280
sharing the trail basically,

422
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,680
as they [--]

423
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,120
milestone's and recombining

424
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,520
all of those trails together

425
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,680
to be both this really

426
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,200
rich content stories, essentially,

427
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,680
but it's also structured by data.

428
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,680
So, we're essentially going to be

429
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,600
building out this huge neural network

430
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,760
of life paths that can be used

431
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,960
to really answer the question.

432
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,520
Provide the guidance and inspiration

433
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,560
that women are looking for

434
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,080
when they say

435
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,520
they either want to mentor

436
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,240
or want to be a mentor.

437
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,120
Wow. Okay.

438
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,560
So, I have to say first,

439
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,040
that reflecting back on this idea

440
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,080
of decision making trees and sometimes,

441
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,800
this fear of making certain decisions

442
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,120
and the different outcomes that can make.

443
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:12,960
And I reflect back,

444
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,280
I'm a huge Broadway fan.

445
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,520
And there was a show that I saw

446
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,640
quite a few times called

447
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,720
If/Then with Idina Menzel.

448
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,000
And the whole show

449
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,760
was about this character who has to make

450
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,840
some lifelong decisions.

451
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,520
And the show kept going

452
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,560
through different realities

453
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,800
and showing what would have happened

454
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,440
had she made those different decisions.

455
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,160
But the bottom line of the story

456
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,600
was that by not making a decision

457
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,560
or by being fearful of making a decision,

458
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,800
then she was making

459
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,440
some of the poorest decisions

460
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,280
by not making them in the first place.

461
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,440
And she was longing for that mentorship

462
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,400
throughout the show.

463
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,560
So, all about this need

464
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,280
that the OwnTrail is trying to solve.

465
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,440
So, I'm understanding that the idea

466
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,240
that you creating this big network

467
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,000
of different pathways

468
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,800
that people have taken.

469
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,640
You're creating this

470
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,960
community of mentorship

471
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,440
where women can seek mentors

472
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,280
or they can offer mentorship to others.

473
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,320
What is the pain point

474
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,640
that you're out there trying to solve

475
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,200
that came as an inspiration

476
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
through Blaze Your Own Trail?

477
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,800
I mean, there's two sides of pain point.

478
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,400
On one side, it's like we were worrying

479
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,520
about our pass through life

480
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,280
worrying about

481
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,920
how we're going to get there.

482
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,520
We needed some people who look like us

483
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,320
in the places we aspire to.

484
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,560
And we don't always have

485
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,480
that access to that. And honestly,

486
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,480
even when you enter a relationship,

487
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,800
you're never going to get

488
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,400
everything you need

489
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,680
from a single person, right?

490
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,320
There's just so many

491
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,680
different facets of our lives

492
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,600
and different situations

493
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,960
that it really aggregates.

494
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,000
And inspiration really

495
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,160
is so much more powerful.

496
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,440
But like that, and then on the flip side

497
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,600
is the fact that we want to be able

498
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,560
the past is coming up behind us.

499
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,040
But the traditional ways of doing that

500
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,840
aren't scalable.

501
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,440
So, I can't say yes to every coffee.

502
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,800
Even when I [--].

503
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,600
And so, what we believe is that

504
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,480
traditionally,

505
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,640
when women say they want a mentor,

506
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,880
they want to be a mentor,

507
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,640
they're really saying,

508
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,240
I want to be able

509
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,080
to solve problems I'm experiencing.

510
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,000
And  75% of women we know

511
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,360
aren't solving these problems.

512
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,400
They aren't getting

513
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,480
the mentorship they want.

514
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,680
So, we at OwnTrails is really reframing

515
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,080
what mentorship can be

516
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,520
in a way that reaches all women,

517
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,240
where they are, when they need it.

518
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,350
And really both provides the [--]

519
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,760
of these different life paths.

520
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,080
But then also provides

521
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,400
the action and the framework

522
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,120
to really navigate your own life

523
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,250
and figure out where are you going

524
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,280
[--]

525
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,480
through the power of community.

526
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,360
What does that mean that 75% of women

527
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,720
don't have the mentorship that they need?

528
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,000
Well, basically from observing them.

529
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,120
Like are you getting as much mentorship

530
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,920
as you wish you were.

531
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,920
Or are you finding as much mentorship.

532
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,680
And 75% say no.

533
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,320
Over 75% say no to this.

534
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,880
And so, what your thesis is that

535
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,000
it's a matter of accessibility that

536
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,600
by building a community

537
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,560
of givers and takers

538
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,520
that are obviously each person

539
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,400
is playing both sides

540
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,400
of the market, right?

541
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,560
You're able to create

542
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,520
this accessibility network

543
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,600
where everybody can get the mentorship

544
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,520
that they're looking for.

545
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,920
Now, are these mentorships

546
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,240
specifically professionally?

547
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,960
So, these are professional decision making

548
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,600
or is this could be anything?

549
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,160
Like I'm thinking

550
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,440
of going on a maternity leave,

551
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,840
but I'm not really sure

552
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,240
how my employer is going to take it.

553
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,120
I mean, the thing is,

554
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,040
like in particularly with women,

555
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,880
I think our personal professional lives

556
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,800
are so inherently intertwined.

557
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,600
And platform systems and discussions

558
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,440
tend to be siloed into like,

559
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,840
this is personal versus this is professional.

560
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,760
And so, we're really trying

561
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,120
to blow that idea open.

562
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,320
And so, yeah, it is [--] shared are.

563
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,440
It's yes, it's different career obstacles

564
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,880
that women have navigated

565
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,680
and accomplishments.

566
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,000
There's [--]

567
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,360
or fertility issues.

568
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,480
There's mental health.

569
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,520
There's grieving.

570
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,080
There is self-doubt.

571
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,920
There's unhealthy relationships.

572
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,280
There's great relationships.

573
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,040
And it's really, it's the culmination

574
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,240
of all those milestones

575
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,920
that really makes up

576
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,280
what our real journey looks like.

577
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,480
And it's not the perfect linear path

578
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,520
that we might have expected.

579
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,080
I love it.

580
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,840
Okay, Rebekah,

581
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,120
so two things before we go.

582
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,040
First, reflecting back

583
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,080
on the incredible experiences you've had

584
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,440
going to five different colleges.

585
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,040
And I'm calling that

586
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,120
an incredible experience

587
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,640
that probably very few people have.

588
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,560
So, and I'm sure that

589
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,520
there's a lot to take from there as well.

590
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,160
All the way to being VP at Zillow

591
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,480
and working there for 15 years

592
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,160
to writing a book to your own company.

593
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,680
What are some really key takeaways

594
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,360
that I could take for myself

595
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,640
or for my friends as we are just starting

596
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,600
on our journey, right?

597
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,080
I mean, I'm just in college now.

598
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,440
So, what are some things

599
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,880
that I should be keeping in mind

600
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,920
that you would recommend for me?

601
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,040
I really like this framework

602
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,280
that I recommend sometimes to people.

603
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,840
It is [--]

604
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,640
in terms of having your eyes

605
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,840
on some faraway vision.

606
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,480
And it's really,

607
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,400
at any point in your life thinking about

608
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,680
what are the things in my life

609
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,200
that are giving me the most energy.

610
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,400
Like where are my passions,

611
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,680
what's fueling me,

612
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,120
and what am I good at.

613
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,440
And that's not necessarily like [--]

614
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,720
or the job you have.

615
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,780
But it's like, what are those inherent,

616
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,240
Sorry.

617
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,280
No worries.

618
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,520
What are those inherent life path

619
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,520
and where you need it.

620
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,280
And sometimes it's as simple

621
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,840
as this job description

622
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,000
and you apply to the job.

623
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,120
And sometimes where you're needed

624
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,600
is a little bit requires

625
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,840
a little more creativity.

626
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,880
And you have to see

627
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,200
that there's problems to be solved

628
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,560
and you're the person to solve it.

629
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,040
But the advice really would be

630
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,560
if you triangulate those three things,

631
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,240
your skills and your passion

632
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,120
and where you're needed

633
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,160
and use that to really guide

634
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,640
what you do and where you go next.

635
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,920
I think that it will open up

636
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,480
some really interesting opportunities

637
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,850
and experiences in your life.

638
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,640
I love it. Rebekah, right before we go,

639
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,160
I want to thank you

640
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,520
for being so generous with your time.

641
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,120
This is really really fantastic.

642
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,640
I need three words that you would use

643
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,640
to describe yourself.

644
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,960
Okay. I would say creative.

645
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,800
Okay.

646
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,080
Excited. I get excited

647
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,760
about a lot of ideas.

648
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:26,760
And, well, a hyphenated word, risk-taker.

649
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,720
Creative, excited, and risk-taker. I love it.

650
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,120
Rebekah, thank you very very much.

651
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,080
OwnTrail and Blaze Your Own Trail.

652
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,840
And you also have a crowdfunding campaign

653
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,800
that's active and I believe

654
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,640
it has a few days left.

655
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,240
Well, by the time that this gets aired,

656
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,280
it will already be over.

657
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,840
But it'll be successfully over.

658
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,600
And I think it's like right there, right?

659
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,000
It's like right there.

660
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,480
Yeah. We're at 95% right now.

661
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,080
95%.

662
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,400
Yeah, I would love for everyone listening

663
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,560
that identifies as a woman

664
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,840
to share your trail at owntrail.com.

665
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,960
And everyone [--]

666
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,960
the woman that you know,

667
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,920
that are inspiring and ask them to do so.

668
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,640
And it's a group effort. So, yeah.

669
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,960
I love it.

670
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,360
Rebekah, thank you very very much.

671
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,800
And stay safe and stay healthy.

672
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,600
Thank you. You too.

673
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,960
Thanks for having me.

674
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:22,720
Thank you.
