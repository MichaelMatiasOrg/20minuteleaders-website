1
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,849
Fantastic.

2
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,760
Itai Sadan, thank you for joining me

3
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,400
on 20 Minute leaders.

4
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,520
Thank you for having me.

5
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,680
So great to have you.

6
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,680
I'm so excited to chat

7
00:03:36,681 --> 00:03:39,380
because you're gonna tell me

8
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,560
one of the most fascinating stories,

9
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,120
I think, that one could tell

10
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,760
in the entrepreneurship space

11
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,920
which is identifying an emerging market

12
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,320
out of a garage in Mountain View

13
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,600
with one of your best friends.

14
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,480
But I'm not gonna give away

15
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,240
the whole story.

16
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,680
Itai, how did Duda come about?

17
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,360
So, it came about in late 2008

18
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,840
and me, and as you mentioned,

19
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,360
a very good friend that I know since

20
00:04:03,361 --> 00:04:06,680
actually since high school,

21
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:08,760
we were both here in Palo Alto

22
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,040
working back then for SAP.

23
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,040
And we were, for a very long time,

24
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,520
we were trying to come up

25
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,000
we always knew

26
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,360
we wanted to do something together,

27
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,840
we just didn't know what it would be.

28
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,280
And we probably had

29
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,680
a thousand different ideas

30
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,400
that we thought about over the years

31
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,280
and shut them all down

32
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,840
for different reasons.

33
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,520
And then walking,

34
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:34,760
the actual idea for Duda

35
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,480
didn't come up in the garage.

36
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,280
It actually came out while walking

37
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,960
around on University Ave in Palo Alto.

38
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,080
I know you live in Palo Alto

39
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,120
so very, very close.

40
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,000
It's the one street that has a bar in it.

41
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,120
So, everybody knows.

42
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,680
So, walking to the Apple store.

43
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,080
Okay.

44
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,040
This is the same Apple store

45
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,000
that Steve Jobs also used to live

46
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,400
right in the neighborhood

47
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,480
and he used to visit that

48
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,400
same store as well.

49
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,000
And looking at that

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,520
first version of the iPhone,

51
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:07,640
the first version of the iPhone

52
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,440
came out in 2007.

53
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:09,760
Right.

54
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,520
And we were playing around in 2008,

55
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,680
and it just dawned on us

56
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,680
for the first time

57
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:17,320
that the entire Internet

58
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,400
was moving into this device.

59
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,400
But who knew?

60
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,000
I mean, iPhones came up.

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,600
They were great.

62
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,280
They were tiny.

63
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,120
The real first,

64
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,120
real good touch interface.

65
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,320
How did you realize that, wow,

66
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
yes, internet is moving to mobile?

67
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:35,000
'cause we were both engineers

68
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,240
and we played with all the technologies.

69
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,800
There were phones before that.

70
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,040
There were Blackberries

71
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,080
and there were Nokias,

72
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,480
and we were programming

73
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,440
with stuff like WAP

74
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,040
and it just was not the experience,

75
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,400
it was a very different experience

76
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,080
than going to your desktop

77
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:52,640
and getting the full experience

78
00:05:52,641 --> 00:05:54,480
of the browser.

79
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,480
And suddenly that same experience

80
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,640
that you would get on a desktop

81
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,600
was for the first time available

82
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:03,160
on a small smartphone.

83
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,560
And we knew that they got it.

84
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,360
They they did something right.

85
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,880
And we were looking back then

86
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,240
at some of the first companies

87
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,640
that took advantage of that phone

88
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,560
and created their dedicated mobile site

89
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,400
like Amazon.

90
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,480
Did m dot amazon.com

91
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,120
and m dot eBay.com and so on.

92
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,560
And you just had a different

93
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,320
They also created

94
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,720
a very dedicated experience

95
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,840
for the mobile phone

96
00:06:27,841 --> 00:06:29,920
for all these mobile users.

97
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
And we're looking around

98
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,720
and we understood.

99
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,680
To build something like Amazon

100
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,880
was able to do for a mobile phone,

101
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,480
you needed resources.

102
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,560
You needed specific skill set.

103
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,560
You needed budgets, know-how.

104
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,200
And it's a whole different

105
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,000
learning experience, right,

106
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,600
like the whole user experience.

107
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,440
I mean the whole adaptation

108
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
you have to make as an engineer.

109
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,480
I know as a web developer myself,

110
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,880
building for the phone is not the same

111
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:54,280
as building for the desktop.

112
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:58,080
Now, okay, Amazon can afford that, right?

113
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,400
And so, can eBay.

114
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,720
But what about the dentist,

115
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:04,720
or the owner of the pizzeria?

116
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:08,560
Or, take all 200 million

117
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,920
small businesses out there.

118
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,280
Clearly they don't have the budget,

119
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,720
the know-how, and the resources to do that.

120
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,320
Right.

121
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,320
That was kind of where the epiphany of,

122
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,120
we're gonna help the little guy

123
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,520
be able to create a store

124
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:23,680
very easily, very simply,

125
00:07:23,681 --> 00:07:25,760
so that they can actually compete

126
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,920
against the bigger guys in the market.

127
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:28,610
Incredible.

128
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:30,400
So, the first product we launched

129
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,200
was called back then,

130
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,160
the company was called

131
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:34,520
based on the first product, Duda mobile.

132
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,960
We were just about converting

133
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:39,760
desktop sites to mobile site.

134
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,480
Wow.

135
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,280
And we started working on that

136
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,320
in very late 2008.

137
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,520
That's just incredible.

138
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,800
So, you were working on that

139
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:48,520
about a year and a half

140
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,920
after the first iPhone comes out

141
00:07:50,921 --> 00:07:51,960
and really the world

142
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,320
gets introduced to mobile

143
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:55,720
and a fun user experience that is actually

144
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:58,320
comparable in the amount of things

145
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,760
you can do to the computer.

146
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,040
I'm gonna give a small spoiler.

147
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,120
10 years later, Duda has over

148
00:08:03,121 --> 00:08:07,120
800,000 websites that it's hosting?

149
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,000
That is correct.

150
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,560
800,000? How do you even,

151
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,680
I mean looking back, in 2008,

152
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,920
you're sitting there in the garage

153
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,840
in Mountain View at this

154
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,600
beautiful, picturesque moment.

155
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,000
Do you even think that you're gonna get

156
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,920
to 800,000 websites built with Duda?

157
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,000
Well, it always sounds like

158
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,120
an overnight success,

159
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,040
but it's an overnight success of 10 years

160
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,480
with a lot of ups and downs in between.

161
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,880
And I remember in 2009,

162
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,720
we built the first prototype

163
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,960
and we were back to that same street

164
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,600
on University Ave kind of knocking

165
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,360
on small business doors and asking them,

166
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,520
"Do you want a mobile site?"

167
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
So really starting one by one

168
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,800
and getting these small,

169
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:51,040
at least to validate the product

170
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,200
and that there was a real need.

171
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:54,760
And it was also, remember

172
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,720
2008, 2009 was a pretty tough time.

173
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,960
Yeah. Who has money for this now, right?

174
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,200
Yeah. We went to investors.

175
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,840
Nobody wanted to invest back then.

176
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,640
Nobody saw the need.

177
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,600
It was really tough

178
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,280
until we had a really great break

179
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,440
in early 2010,

180
00:09:14,441 --> 00:09:19,040
when we did a deal with AT&T,

181
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,280
back then AT&T Interactive, part of AT&T,

182
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,960
that saw the opportunity

183
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,560
and really wanted the technology

184
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,280
in order to sell to their

185
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,720
small business customers.

186
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,640
Wow. Incredible.

187
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:32,520
Duda. What's Duda?

188
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:36,840
So Duda is a, the product involved -

189
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:38,920
Not the product, Itai, the name.

190
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,000
The name Duda? What's Duda?

191
00:09:40,001 --> 00:09:41,500
Ah, the name. Of course.

192
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:45,040
The Dude, The Big Lebowski.

193
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,360
Have you seen the movie?

194
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,800
I have not, but I read your bio

195
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,880
and I know the quote

196
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,400
and tell me the quote anyways.

197
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay. Next time you have to do a prep

198
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,640
before you do a call with me

199
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,760
but yeah.

200
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,080
So, see the movie.

201
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,120
I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

202
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,800
I'm actually, I'll send it to you.

203
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:03,600
So there's a really,

204
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:04,840
many people know it.

205
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,760
It's a cult movie.

206
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,440
The main character is called "The Dude"

207
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,480
played by Jeff Bridges

208
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,960
and both Amir and I, my co-founder,

209
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,720
we're big fans of that movie.

210
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,640
I probably watched it tens of times.

211
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,600
Oh, my God.

212
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,240
10, 20 times.

213
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,440
My girlfriend screams at me

214
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,240
when I watch a movie more than once,

215
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,320
so she would have a heart attack

216
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,200
she's gonna have a heart attack

217
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:29,080
watching this.

218
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,520
Yeah. So, we started watching it

219
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,760
back in college in Israel

220
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,720
and it became part of the culture.

221
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,400
If you're coming to our offices,

222
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,360
you'll see different,

223
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:44,760
all the conference rooms have names

224
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,400
from the movie.

225
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,160
There's the Ringer,

226
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,880
Urban achiever, the Rug Room.

227
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,560
It's a really funny movie.

228
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:53,760
Yeah.

229
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,560
I think you wrote that your favorite quote

230
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,000
from the movie is about a rug

231
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,840
that ties the whole room together.

232
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,200
You have to see the movie. I can't

233
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:03,720
Yeah, but yeah

234
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,560
The whole story starts with

235
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:10,480
the main character's rug gets stolen

236
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,700
I love it.

237
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,560
Itai, you transition,

238
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,240
you're very very successful with Duda

239
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,000
and now you're also very big

240
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,120
in venture capital.

241
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,640
You're a part of the J-Ventures Fund,

242
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,000
which I'm very happy

243
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,760
to be a part of as well.

244
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,320
Part of Tel Aviv partners,

245
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,000
mentor at UpWest Labs.

246
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,840
You invested in TripActions, right?

247
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,240
Pretty early on.

248
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,040
Yeah. Yeah.

249
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,120
In the seed round.

250
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,520
Wow. Okay.

251
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,680
Ilan Twig, the CTO is a very close friend.

252
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,640
I invested in Ilan.

253
00:11:40,641 --> 00:11:41,920
Back then, they said

254
00:11:41,921 --> 00:11:43,560
"Travel company, something."

255
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,240
I said,  "I'm investing in you."

256
00:11:46,241 --> 00:11:50,120
He's a good investment then.

257
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:50,760
Turned out to be

258
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,040
a very successful company.

259
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:55,760
I just had a really great chat with Dovi,

260
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,640
which we released pretty recently.

261
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,280
And one of the things

262
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,080
we were talking about

263
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,280
was impact investing

264
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:02,320
in his whole investment thesis.

265
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,160
And I'd love to know

266
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:04,480
because you're not

267
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,800
a full time investor, right?

268
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,320
You're a part time investor.

269
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,360
You're doing it.

270
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,000
You can see from your background

271
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,080
that you're doing it out of fun.

272
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,760
And you're just as much a mentor

273
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:14,320
as you are an investor.

274
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,280
So, talk to me a little bit

275
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,760
about this strategy of yours

276
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:19,000
and how you cover with companies.

277
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah, it's really,

278
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:23,560
I do it as a side hobby.

279
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,760
I wouldn't consider myself

280
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,800
a real investor.

281
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
It's just when there is

282
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:30,520
an interesting opportunity

283
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,440
and unfortunately I'm so busy

284
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,240
in my day to day work that -

285
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,560
I would hope, you're responsible

286
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,120
for 800,000 websites

287
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,000
so please be busy.

288
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,920
Yeah so, I would say most of my eggs

289
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,280
are in that basket, but once in a while,

290
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,720
if there's something,

291
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,920
someone I believe in,

292
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,880
some opportunity, usually tied to people.

293
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,800
It's really tied to people that I know.

294
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,360
Definitely.

295
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,000
Then, here and there.

296
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,920
I don't do it a lot,

297
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,500
but it is fun when I do.

298
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:02,120
I love it.

299
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:03,000
And it's fun to,

300
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,640
I mainly enjoyed working with them,

301
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:10,680
sharing my experience,

302
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,080
discussing challenges.

303
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,840
And yeah, so I think

304
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,160
that's really the fun part.

305
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,680
Itai, I wanna talk about emerging markets.

306
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,240
It's very rare to meet somebody

307
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,520
who identified an emerging market

308
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,240
was right, rode the wave,

309
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,160
went through the challenges,

310
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,240
raising capital,

311
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,240
in 2009, trying to get customers.

312
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,120
I mean, I didn't do it myself,

313
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,880
but I can see why

314
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,480
it would be very difficult.

315
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,640
I want to be in your position.

316
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,240
I want one day to be able to sit down

317
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,520
and think of a new market

318
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,800
and really ride that wave

319
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,520
and know that, yes,

320
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,080
I was right and I made a dent.

321
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,680
'cause you did.

322
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,240
You made a huge impact

323
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,480
on the Internet world

324
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:54,560
and SMBs presence online.

325
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,240
What are some of your insights

326
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,680
looking back on identifying

327
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,440
emerging markets and riding that wave?

328
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,360
Yeah. I think, the first,

329
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:08,960
it's important to find a real pain point

330
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,560
and where there's enough people

331
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,720
who share that pain point

332
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,200
and where you think you can come up

333
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,720
with a very unique offering

334
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,200
to solve that pain.

335
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,680
And I think we found that

336
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:28,280
in late 2008 and

337
00:14:28,281 --> 00:14:30,000
with the first product.

338
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,800
Right.

339
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,960
I think you always need to come back

340
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,520
to this whole product market fit, right

341
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,800
This is basically what I,

342
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,520
building a product that fits

343
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,080
with a certain pain in the market.

344
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,360
Right.

345
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,440
The fact that you've found it

346
00:14:46,441 --> 00:14:47,520
doesn't guarantee that

347
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,760
it will last forever,

348
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:53,440
and this is where I think over the years,

349
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,320
we had our ups and then we had our downs

350
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,520
and now we're couple of years of another,

351
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,480
like found it again.

352
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,960
I think this is the role

353
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,640
of the entrepreneur, of the founder,

354
00:15:05,641 --> 00:15:07,400
really to make sure that

355
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:12,400
that product market fit is maintained.

356
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,280
But it's very hard

357
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,600
to get product market fit

358
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:16,040
on the get go when you're looking

359
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,200
at an emerging market, right?

360
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,280
Because they don't necessarily understand.

361
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,080
They don't have iPhones yet necessarily.

362
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,380
They don't understand that

363
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,480
this is where things are headed.

364
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,880
So, it's kind of a chicken and the egg.

365
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,360
Right.

366
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,760
Are you letting the market take over first

367
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,640
and then you're gonna go

368
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,600
and try your luck?

369
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,400
Or are you gonna try

370
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,960
and be on top of the wave?

371
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,920
And how do you get

372
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,360
your first customers on board?

373
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:41,120
Yeah. I think, it's the hardest

374
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,840
to educate a market about something

375
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,120
that they don't know they need.

376
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,160
But I think,

377
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,560
when we came out with the idea

378
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:53,600
for mobile websites back then,

379
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,720
we validated the idea.

380
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,520
We put some ads on the Internet

381
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,240
and because if there's a pain,

382
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,440
then people are looking for ways

383
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,640
to resolve it.

384
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,200
They might not know what the solution is,

385
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,200
but we bought some

386
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:10,320
... campaigns around

387
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,280
build mobile website,

388
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,440
create mobile website.

389
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,040
And the first customers,

390
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,720
we actually used our own

391
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,000
the technology was not ready

392
00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:20,280
to hand it over.

393
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,840
We used our own technology to build sites

394
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,320
almost like an an agency, as a professional service.

395
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,160
So, just to validate that the technology

396
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,120
that we built was good enough,

397
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,640
it took probably a year like that

398
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,120
until we got to a place

399
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,600
where we could hand it over

400
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,839
to other people to build website

401
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,160
on behalf of small businesses,

402
00:16:41,161 --> 00:16:43,720
or give it directly to small businesses

403
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,840
to do it themselves.

404
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,240
Right. What were some of the most

405
00:16:46,241 --> 00:16:48,560
unique challenges that you faced

406
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,440
as the CEO?

407
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,760
You're starting out in a garage

408
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,000
with an idea.

409
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:55,000
You're running from door to door

410
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,920
to try and sell this,

411
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,320
and all of a sudden you're growing

412
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,400
and you're scaling and success comes

413
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,280
and investors come.

414
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,080
What do you tell yourself?

415
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,040
Who do you go to?

416
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,920
What are some of the things

417
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,680
that you experience?

418
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,000
Yeah. Yeah.

419
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,800
There's a lot packed in that question.

420
00:17:10,801 --> 00:17:12,550
A lot.

421
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,600
Well, we have five minutes.

422
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,280
So, I'm sure we can get

423
00:17:14,281 --> 00:17:16,270
through everything, right?

424
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,480
Okay, yeah. I think,

425
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,280
what I would say is that,

426
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,240
I think when you're growing

427
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,720
and you're onto something and scaling,

428
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,510
growth solves a lot of problems,

429
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,440
it creates problems,

430
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,310
but it also, when you see growth,

431
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,560
then investors see growth

432
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,510
and they want to invest

433
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,480
and I think that's easier to solve.

434
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,640
It's kind of rich man's problems.

435
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:44,880
There are problems that come with growth,

436
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,590
but those are solvable.

437
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,070
I think the harder challenges is is

438
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,160
when you're not seeing,

439
00:17:54,161 --> 00:17:56,350
when it's not that clear

440
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,510
or when markets change.

441
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,480
And that happened to us.

442
00:17:59,481 --> 00:18:04,160
If I go to 2014.

443
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,440
So we were just doing,

444
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:09,720
think of 2010 to 2013

445
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,520
something like that,

446
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,400
we were just selling mobile sites.

447
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:18,790
We got to a huge amount of customers

448
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,030
buying from us mobile sites.

449
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,920
We had partnerships

450
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,320
with GoDaddy and Google and OpenTable

451
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,590
and all that.

452
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,920
And suddenly, it wasn't as suddenly,

453
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,520
but we identified a risk

454
00:18:31,521 --> 00:18:34,240
because the web was moving

455
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,120
to responsive web design

456
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,790
and we're only on the mobile side.

457
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,560
And we were looking at this

458
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,560
and we're saying,

459
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:43,790
"Wow, we're at a risky place"

460
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,240
because suddenly there's tablets,

461
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,000
and there's mobiles and desktop

462
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,960
and people have browsers

463
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,960
on their watches and in their cars.

464
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,160
Nobody wants to build a site

465
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,680
for every different device.

466
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,120
And kind of responsive web design

467
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,830
rose as the right way to do it.

468
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,510
You build it once, it runs everywhere.

469
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,760
So cutting it short,

470
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:02,360
we understood

471
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,750
we needed to build for that.

472
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,600
We needed to develop our product

473
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:06,480
in that direction.

474
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,080
We built another product.

475
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:12,000
Basically, the product that you see today,

476
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,880
which is our responsive website builder is our second product.

477
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,170
That's the pivoted product

478
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,300
from the risk that you identified.

479
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,830
So we had to pivot to another product.

480
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,120
And luckily that we did it

481
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,040
'cause the decline started happening

482
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,680
to our first product.

483
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,840
And if we hadn't recognized

484
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,440
what the shift in the market,

485
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,000
we basically lost product market fit.

486
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,600
So we had to rebuild

487
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,270
a new product to fit

488
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,680
what the market actually wanted

489
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,480
and I think those were the tough years

490
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,600
of rebuilding that product

491
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,310
and relaunching on another product.

492
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,310
2014 to 2016 were two pretty tough years.

493
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,760
We even went through

494
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,550
a little bit of layoffs back then.

495
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,680
Wow.

496
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,520
And then eventually with

497
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,080
catching the wave again

498
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,080
with the new product,

499
00:19:58,081 --> 00:20:03,350
we're now five, six years later,

500
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,960
obviously

501
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,320
we made the right decision.

502
00:20:08,321 --> 00:20:11,040
And the company has grown significantly

503
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:11,680
since then.

504
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,600
But that was like

505
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:15,720
almost a sudden death moment there where,

506
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:18,560
and you know that

507
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,000
there's quite a few companies

508
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:23,070
over the history that kind of missed that, right

509
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,320
They had the product market fit,

510
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,350
if we're talking about phones

511
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,400
BlackBerry, Nokia.

512
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,790
I was just about to

513
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,000
They were a rubber company

514
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:30,780
did you know that?

515
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,110
No, I didn't know that.

516
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,120
So, they pivoted once

517
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,880
well to phones and to electronics.

518
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,000
They didn't complete the pivot though.

519
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,440
It's hard. It's hard to do,

520
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:43,080
and maybe for our next conversation,

521
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,680
we can talk about what it takes to pivot

522
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,160
and the challenges with that.

523
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,200
It sounds like to me,

524
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,680
it takes a lot of bravery.

525
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,520
And it takes a lot of confidence

526
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,560
in yourself and the team

527
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,280
to be able to say,

528
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,440
"Listen, we might not be doing

529
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,440
the right thing right now.

530
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,680
We did two years ago,

531
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,680
but things are changing.

532
00:20:58,681 --> 00:21:01,360
And we're, again, going to have

533
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,840
to understand our market

534
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,750
and to be better again."

535
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,070
Now, take that.

536
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,200
Think of like at Nokia or BlackBerry

537
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,400
where you have thousands of people

538
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,960
selling product A

539
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,160
and you need to tell these people,

540
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,160
"Well, this product

541
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,720
that you're selling

542
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
that's bringing billions of dollars,

543
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,510
forget about it.

544
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,440
That's history.

545
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,040
You need to be selling product B"

546
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,520
Understand

547
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,070
how difficult it is to transition.

548
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,600
And the problem is that you can't wait

549
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,960
for the product to stop selling.

550
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,160
You have to know ahead of time in advance.

551
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,960
So, while you're starting to decline

552
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,240
to already start working

553
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,840
on the other thing

554
00:21:32,841 --> 00:21:34,040
And that's the hardest thing

555
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,760
because then they're coming

556
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,280
and saying to you,

557
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,040
"What are you talking about?"

558
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,270
We're still selling."

559
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,320
We're making billions of dollars

560
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,520
Which marketer would give you real estate

561
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,880
on like the home page

562
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,320
to put in a new product

563
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,480
when everybody's buying the old product.

564
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,920
But this is the role of the entrepreneur,

565
00:21:49,921 --> 00:21:53,240
the founders, to really understand

566
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,640
the dynamics in the market,

567
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,440
have the vision,

568
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,640
and persuade everybody else to follow that.

569
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,640
Itai, what are you passionate about?

570
00:22:00,641 --> 00:22:04,080
What am I passionate about?

571
00:22:04,081 --> 00:22:06,080
I love working with people,

572
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,360
I love working with the team.

573
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:09,480
I love the challenges.

574
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,160
Every stage in the company,

575
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,600
this is why it always stays interesting

576
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,400
because the challenges to get

577
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,600
to the first million dollars of revenue

578
00:22:19,601 --> 00:22:21,280
is different than the challenges

579
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,000
to get to the 10 million

580
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,440
which is completely different

581
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,830
than the challenges to get to 50 million.

582
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,760
So, I think it just keeps it

583
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,200
very very interesting

584
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,640
and you learn a lot.

585
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,440
It's the best, best education

586
00:22:36,441 --> 00:22:38,000
that you can get is actually

587
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,560
to try to build a business and to scale a business

588
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,840
and I think that's something

589
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,790
that I really enjoy.

590
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,280
I love it.

591
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,560
Itai, right before we leave,

592
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,280
I wanna thank you again

593
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,600
for this great inspiration.

594
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,440
It's such a remarkable story.

595
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,120
I love emerging markets.

596
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,480
I love sitting down and trying to identify

597
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,200
what's happening

598
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,280
and where is the world moving.

599
00:22:54,281 --> 00:22:56,400
Ever since I started

600
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
with J-Ventures as well.

601
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,640
That's I think the biggest gift

602
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,000
that a new young entrepreneur can get

603
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,800
is to really try and understand

604
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,240
what are the dynamics,

605
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
how do markets work,

606
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,200
how do entrepreneurs work.

607
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,040
And, Itai, before we leave,

608
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,720
I need three words that best describe you.

609
00:23:14,721 --> 00:23:20,000
I always manage to keep calm.

610
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,720
To be cool.

611
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,400
Things get thrown at you

612
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,160
from the left and from the right,
- You look very calm and cool.

613
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,800
and I think you need to know

614
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,720
how to cope with it.

615
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,440
So I think people, if you ask

616
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,830
people will tell you that

617
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,520
it doesn't matter

618
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,600
One day it could be good news,

619
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,350
the next day it could be bad news.

620
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,720
You need to plow through it

621
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,310
and continue to move on and improve.

622
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,160
I love it. Itai, toda raba.

623
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,320
I'm definitely reaching back

624
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,040
for some advice

625
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,110
when I have my own startup.

626
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,960
So, look out for that email.

627
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,600
And thank you

628
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,720
for your time and inspiration.

629
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,256
Thank you for having me. It was fun.

630
00:23:57,257 --> 00:23:58,000
Take care.
Bye.
