1
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Erika Gerdes, how are you doing.

2
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,240
Hi, thanks so much for having me.

3
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,240
I'm excited to be here.

4
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,560
It's really wonderful

5
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,680
for you to be here on the show.

6
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,400
I'm really excited

7
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,320
to talk about authenticity,

8
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,960
talking about individuality

9
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,200
through your lenses.

10
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,600
Because you are a former

11
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,200
Google business executive,

12
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,440
spend many years there.

13
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,200
And you've taken a different route now

14
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,720
towards understanding a little bit

15
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,840
of who we are

16
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,240
and what we strive to be

17
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,960
and how to be our authentic selves.

18
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,760
So, I'm excited to hear from you

19
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,080
what that really means to you,

20
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,080
and how you help others achieve that.

21
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,560
Awesome.

22
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm very excited to talk about it.

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,320
It's a topic that is

24
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,000
incredibly close to my heart and certainly

25
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,600
what I have devoted my life to.

26
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Wonderful. So, authenticity.

27
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,480
Talk to me a little bit about

28
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,320
what does authenticity mean?

29
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,880
So, the challenge with authenticity is

30
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,720
it's one of those cliched terms.

31
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,520
And like so many of them

32
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,440
in this industry of self-improvement

33
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,840
or personal development,

34
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,400
that we don't really know

35
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,560
what it actually means.

36
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,760
So, the way I define authenticity is

37
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,200
the practice of letting go

38
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,760
of who we think we need to be

39
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,920
and embracing who we truly are.

40
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,840
Because I really believe that

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,960
when we embrace who we actually are,

42
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,320
we're able to have much greater impact

43
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,960
in our communities, on our families

44
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,680
and on the world around us.

45
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,120
So, just as a young entrepreneur myself,

46
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,000
and I'm always looking

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,560
at different startups

48
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,520
and different products

49
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,680
and I'm thinking of that now

50
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,120
as a product of how to help one

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,520
become more authentic.

52
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,440
And it starts always with a pain point,

53
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,480
what is the problem

54
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,360
that you're trying to solve.

55
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,480
So, I'd love to hear a little bit

56
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,520
about your journey

57
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,840
and how you transitioned

58
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,760
from your work in the workforce

59
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,360
to understanding that there is a problem

60
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,640
that perhaps people are not as authentic

61
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,760
as they could be.

62
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,280
To your point,

63
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,240
I was my biggest pain point.

64
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,320
And I experienced this emptiness

65
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,560
inside of me almost all of my life.

66
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,280
I called it the void.

67
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,000
Some people call it like a black hole

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,640
or just an ingenious

69
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,200
in the pit of their stomach.

70
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,560
And I thought I was alone in that feeling.

71
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,880
And I thought that the best way for me

72
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,520
to overcome that experience

73
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,760
was to do more, achieve more, be more.

74
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,800
And so, it led me to, basically a lifetime

75
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,360
of collecting gold stars

76
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,520
and doing everything I thought

77
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,120
I needed to do in order to be the best.

78
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,520
And in seeking perfection,

79
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,520
I completely lost myself.

80
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,240
And what I really began to realize is that

81
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,560
perfect wasn't even good enough.

82
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,480
I mean, it wasn't just perfect in my job,

83
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,360
it was perfect in all parts of my life.

84
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,520
I needed to be the perfect wife,

85
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,760
the perfect mother, the perfect employee,

86
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,160
the perfect homemaker,

87
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,680
like all of the things.

88
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,840
And in doing so, I was putting out

89
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,040
so many fires, I didn't realize

90
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,720
I was the one getting burned

91
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,000
over and over and over again.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And the pivot point in my life,

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,600
because I think every good hero's quest

94
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,320
has an inciting event, and mine was that

95
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,760
when my second daughter was born,

96
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,520
she was born with a tumor

97
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,480
on her spinal cord,

98
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,640
which we didn't know about

99
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,400
until she was two weeks old.

100
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,240
And it required that she have

101
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
a seven hour spinal neurosurgery

102
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,680
when she was three months old,

103
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,760
which was so far off of any plan

104
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,640
that I had developed

105
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,160
for how my perfectly curated life

106
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,160
was supposed to go.

107
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,320
That it made me

108
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,560
take a deeper look at my life.

109
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,320
She is okay.

110
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,640
She will have to have other surgeries

111
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,120
in her life, but I'll skip ahead to that

112
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,560
in case I forget.

113
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,760
But while I was in the hospital,

114
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,040
I had a thought that changed my life.

115
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,400
And the thought was:

116
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,160
I have one life to live,

117
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,560
there are no second chances, no do overs.

118
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,240
I get one go round at this life.

119
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,120
Why would I spend

120
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,480
one more minute waiting to be happy.

121
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,600
And what I realized was, I was in my 30s,

122
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
I had already been at Google for,

123
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,080
I don't know, nine years at that point,

124
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,520
something like that, and I didn't feel

125
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,680
like I was living my life.

126
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,560
I felt like I was living

127
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,080
somebody else's life.

128
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,840
And I had to start

129
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,440
getting really really honest with myself

130
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,520
about how and where and why

131
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,040
I was going through the motions

132
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,960
in all parts of my life

133
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,640
and start making changes

134
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,720
that enabled me to get back

135
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,800
to get closer to who I truly am.

136
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,640
And it's not something

137
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,200
that you make in one decision,

138
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,320
that's why I call it a practice.

139
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,560
Because we don't lose ourselves

140
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,520
or find ourselves or make changes

141
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,480
with any one grand decision.

142
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,520
It is these millions

143
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,200
of little micro decisions that we make

144
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,920
over and over and over which either

145
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,480
take us further away from ourselves

146
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,360
or bring us closer back to ourselves.

147
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,520
And so, that's what I teach now,

148
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,520
is how to listen more deeply

149
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,520
to what's missing and how we can begin

150
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,240
to find it for ourselves so that

151
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,880
we can begin to embrace who we are,

152
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,160
and what we truly want in our lives.

153
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,720
So, what was the most difficult part

154
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,040
of making that tangible transition?

155
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,720
So, I understand the mindset

156
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,120
that you're entering this

157
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,440
and you're accumulating

158
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,640
this inner understanding

159
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,520
that you're not necessarily fulfilling

160
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,200
your true potential for happiness,

161
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,240
and then there is a trigger in your life

162
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,760
and adversity that triggers that

163
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,680
and makes you realize, okay,

164
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,080
maybe I should do something about it.

165
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,120
So, how does that actually happen,

166
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,960
that transition to do something about it?

167
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,120
With a lot of crying.

168
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,440
I think the transition requires

169
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,280
we have to get to a place

170
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,400
where we realize that

171
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,200
we can't just keep being okay with okay.

172
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,840
And I know so many high achievers

173
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,440
and overachievers who you'll ask

174
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:56,960
how they're doing,

175
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,880
they're fine, everything's fine,

176
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,600
they're small problems,

177
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,560
I have nothing to complain about.

178
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,760
And when we do that, we're really ignoring

179
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,720
some deeper yearning inside of ourselves

180
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,160
that doesn't do us or the world a service

181
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,880
and talking about how fine everything is.

182
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,280
Yes, it may be, first of all problems,

183
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,600
but if we ignore those things,

184
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,400
we could actually, if we were to actually

185
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,520
pay attention to those things,

186
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,360
we could solve

187
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,000
a lot of third world problems

188
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,400
by actually paying attention

189
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
to the yearnings in our heart

190
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,320
and our souls.

191
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,040
And I believe that each of us

192
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,080
has the capability of changing the world.

193
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,600
But we can only do that when we start

194
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,360
by changing ourselves.

195
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,120
And so, for me, that change required

196
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,760
getting really really honest with myself

197
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,080
about why I was stuck,

198
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,400
what I was holding on to.

199
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,320
And the iteration for me included,

200
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,760
first, I ended up leaving my marriage

201
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,520
because I realized

202
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
it was never going to be

203
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,840
what I needed it to be.

204
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,480
And I had become such a different person

205
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,920
in order to be married

206
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,560
that as I became more myself

207
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,000
it just didn't work anymore,

208
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,800
which was on me.

209
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,920
And then I started

210
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,520
getting honest with myself that

211
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,680
while I love Google, I mean,

212
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,880
I was a preeminent Google cheerleader,

213
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,360
I was always a Google.

214
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,400
They have interviews that are like

215
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,640
a Googleyness interview,

216
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,080
which is literally determining

217
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,920
how googley you are, it was always me.

218
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,200
Like I can nail Googleyness

219
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,680
from a mile away because I love Google.

220
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,600
And I can say to myself,

221
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,640
I graduated from there.

222
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,400
I didn't leave there

223
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,880
because I really did love it.

224
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,760
But I found something,

225
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,520
that for me, I loved more.

226
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,160
And that was helping make a difference

227
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,120
in people's lives.

228
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,840
And so, it was incredibly hard

229
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,640
for me to leave.

230
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,640
And it has been the most rewarding journey

231
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,200
and transition I've ever made in my life,

232
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,920
also the hardest.

233
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,000
Right. It sounds like

234
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,280
a very positive transition.

235
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,520
But I have to grasp,

236
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,600
because there seems to be a fine balance

237
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,560
between when this transition happens.

238
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,120
Because one of the things that happened

239
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,520
as I transition into my college education

240
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,600
and I came into a university

241
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,760
older than most of my peers.

242
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,600
I was 24, most of them were 18.

243
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,480
I had commanded previously teams

244
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,920
in the Israel Defense Forces

245
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,000
and when I came in and people were asking,

246
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,720
I remember the first occurrences,

247
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,640
I was riding my bike

248
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,400
and somebody was riding past me

249
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,680
and they screamed,

250
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,160
"How are you doing?"

251
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,760
And then they continued.

252
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,240
I couldn't even have time to respond.

253
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,360
And I started seeing this

254
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,920
more and more often

255
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,640
that people are asking questions

256
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,400
about how you're doing.

257
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,640
But they're either not waiting for answers

258
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,040
or the answers that they gave me

259
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,240
when I asked them truthfully,

260
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,000
they're very on the surface.

261
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,800
And that made me think

262
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,960
about the society, in this race

263
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,560
that you're that you're describing

264
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,480
to become the perfect self.

265
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,640
But on the other hand,

266
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,680
without striving and without sometimes

267
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,760
doing as we're growing up,

268
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,560
things that we don't necessarily enjoy,

269
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,040
we can't get to be

270
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,360
an executive at Google, right?

271
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:45,920
Yes.

272
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,560
So, how does that balance work?

273
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,920
And at what point in your life

274
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,760
do you have to become more authentic

275
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,160
versus just going along

276
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,680
with what the society is telling you?

277
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,560
Well, I think that

278
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,000
we're always at a crossroads

279
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,360
at every point in our lives

280
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,920
to make a decision between

281
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,480
holding on to good and safe

282
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,920
or letting go of that

283
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,320
and going after what is great and true

284
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,960
and authentic for our lives.

285
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,240
And most of us never make that choice

286
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,440
to go toward what's great,

287
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,800
because it requires letting go of safety;

288
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,280
it requires letting go of certainty;

289
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,280
requires letting go of our comfort zone;

290
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,600
and walking without any guarantees

291
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,480
straight into the fog of the unknown.

292
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,800
And that's incredibly scary.

293
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,160
So, the younger we are, while yes,

294
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,440
we tend to be more risk tolerance

295
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,200
to a certain extent when we're younger,

296
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,320
most of us are still

297
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,960
very insecure with ourselves.

298
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,760
We're still trying to figure out

299
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,880
who we are just at any level,

300
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,080
whether it's surface or deeper.

301
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,640
So, for me, I don't think

302
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,720
it could have happened earlier.

303
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,040
I mean, there were so many opportunities

304
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,720
before I actually decided

305
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,320
to go down this road

306
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,960
that I just didn't take

307
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,840
those opportunities

308
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,600
because I just wasn't ready for them.

309
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,000
But I also really believe

310
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,800
that everything that we experience

311
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,920
is intended to prepare us

312
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,120
for what is to come.

313
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,720
So, all those previous times

314
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,320
where I chose good instead of great

315
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,160
helped motivate me.

316
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,960
Because I learned

317
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,520
over and over and over again,

318
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,920
I choose good, I don't feel good.

319
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,680
It is comfortable, or at least it's known,

320
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,160
but it doesn't feel good.

321
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,640
It just feels empty or it feels hollow

322
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,280
or it feels surface as you said.

323
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,000
It doesn't feel rich

324
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,960
and rewarding and full.

325
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,560
And when I experienced it enough times,

326
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,920
I realized I don't want to live a life

327
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,360
that by the end of my lifetime

328
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,600
I look back and think,

329
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,120
"That wasn't so bad."

330
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,120
I want to look back

331
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,760
and have been an adventure.

332
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,360
Know that I really experienced

333
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,440
full-range.

334
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,640
And full-range, what I've discovered is

335
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,440
I thought when I started on this journey,

336
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,440
that full-range meant

337
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,480
not being locked into a marriage or a job

338
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,160
that was holding me back

339
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,560
or keeping me down.

340
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,240
That's not what full-range is at all.

341
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,320
Full-range is about

342
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,240
being able to feel everything,

343
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,880
experience life fully, which means

344
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,400
all the joys and all the fears,

345
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,880
all the happiness and all the pain.

346
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,880
And when we know that

347
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,040
we can do all of that

348
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,720
and we will be okay no matter what,

349
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,240
we're not guarding ourselves

350
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,520
from those experiences.

351
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,960
We're throwing ourselves into them.

352
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,720
And that's what I hope for everybody.

353
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,960
Because so many of us

354
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,520
stay on these incredibly narrow paths,

355
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,560
just doing the same things

356
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,320
over and over again.

357
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,800
Whether it's in a personal relationship

358
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,360
or professional job.

359
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,120
And it's because we're too afraid of,

360
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,000
will we be able to actually make it

361
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,320
if we let go of this

362
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,960
and go towards something else.

363
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,520
And when we start to realize

364
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,960
we're going to make it,

365
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,200
no matter what we are going to be okay

366
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,080
even if it means risking everything,

367
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,000
that's when we get

368
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,880
to really truly live and have impact.

369
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,320
So, you leave the very intensive job

370
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,160
that you had at Google,

371
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,000
and now you're helping others

372
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,240
achieve their authentic potential.

373
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,320
So, what does that actually mean?

374
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,240
What do you do on a day to day basis

375
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,800
that is helping others

376
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,880
go through a similar journey

377
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,000
that you went through?

378
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,800
So my favorite thing at Google

379
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,160
was building relationships

380
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,880
and deepening connections

381
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,200
and establishing trust

382
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,600
is what I've always been

383
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,960
really innately good at.

384
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,400
And that's exactly what I get to do

385
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,280
all day every day, is listen to people

386
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,840
and hold space for them

387
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,480
to be really honest and vulnerable.

388
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,640
I mean, there are a lot of people

389
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,760
in our lives, if you think about

390
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,520
how much of the time

391
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,200
do you feel like you can

392
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,680
truly be vulnerable around somebody.

393
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,320
It's not very often.

394
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,120
And to be able to give people the space

395
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,560
and the gift of allowing them

396
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,840
to feel really safe, being vulnerable,

397
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,560
is in and of itself a great gift.

398
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,680
And when we allow ourselves

399
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,920
to be vulnerable and expose the fear

400
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,040
and talk about the stuff

401
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,800
that we don't ever want

402
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,880
to say out loud to anybody,

403
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,520
because we think,

404
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,000
"Oh, my God,

405
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,960
what are they going to think about me?"

406
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,520
"They're going to run for the hills."

407
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,680
Then we start to realize

408
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,240
that stuff is actually just,

409
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,480
they're just fear stories.

410
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,200
They're not real.

411
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,360
And when we can bring those things

412
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,400
to the surface, instead of ignoring them

413
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,800
or denying them or

414
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,560
pretending they don't exist,

415
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
then they stop having as much power.

416
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,040
And when we can take the power away

417
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,160
from those deeper things

418
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,080
that keep us stuck,

419
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,760
we're so much more free to take action

420
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,480
and make a bigger impact in our lives.

421
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,760
And so, that's what I do,

422
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,440
is I really help people identify

423
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,400
what those some people call them,

424
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,360
limiting beliefs, I think

425
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,320
they tend to be deeper than that.

426
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,280
I call them fear stories.

427
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,240
And most of us don't even know

428
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,520
that they're playing out

429
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,560
over and over and over and over

430
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,120
in our lives

431
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,040
and over over and over

432
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,680
in our heads.

433
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,000
In our micro decisions,

434
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,520
not just in the grand scheme.

435
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,760
So, it's in the day to day things,

436
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,800
that thousand decisions

437
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,900
we make every minute.

438
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,200
Exactly. Yeah.

439
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,040
So, how do you help people

440
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,960
go through that understanding?

441
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,480
It sounds like it's not just

442
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,120
a nice one hour Zoom call,

443
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,400
okay, tell me your fear stories

444
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,920
and let's get them out of the way.

445
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,760
It sounds like a more difficult process.

446
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,240
What is your role in that process

447
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,560
and how does the life cycle of this

448
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,800
look for someone who is working with you?

449
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,560
It's a great question.

450
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,240
So, I mean, it differs.

451
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,360
I don't have a process, a set agenda.

452
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,520
Like I used to be super processory

453
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,240
or relatively process oriented,

454
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,400
very planned and structured

455
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,440
in my work at Google, and now,

456
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,880
I go into every call completely unprepared

457
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,240
because I know I'm actually prepared

458
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,000
no matter what.

459
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,840
I can handle whatever is going to come.

460
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,520
And so, what I always say

461
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,600
to every client is:

462
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,000
there's no topic that's off the table

463
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,320
because the thing is,

464
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,920
no matter what topic we're talking about,

465
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,200
it's all the different doors

466
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,880
into the same deeper stuff.

467
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,600
And so, we don't realize it,

468
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,560
but we're playing out the same patterns

469
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,600
in our personal lives,

470
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,760
and our professional lives,

471
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,800
and our family lives,

472
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,760
and all these places.

473
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,760
And so, the way it typically looks

474
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,760
is that, especially for,

475
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,000
like I'll give you an executive

476
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
as an example.

477
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,680
An executive I'm working with

478
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,920
is talking about how she is launching

479
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,640
a new business plan to her organization.

480
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,760
And we start talking about

481
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,720
what's holding her back

482
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,360
from actually taking action

483
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,240
or how she's procrastinating

484
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,960
on writing the email or how she's looking,

485
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,480
and all of that stuff.

486
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,800
There is the surface power through it

487
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,320
and just get past it,

488
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,640
and then there's the deeper stuff of

489
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,200
why does this keep happening,

490
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,280
what is it that we're actually

491
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,240
battling up against.

492
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,200
Because what we tend to look at

493
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,160
as human beings,

494
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,200
especially in the workforce,

495
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,800
when we want to make a change,

496
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,200
we look at the tactical things

497
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,400
that we need to do differently.

498
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,920
What are the new skills,

499
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,240
what are the new habits I need to develop,

500
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,280
and that's great.

501
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:34,960
But that's actually

502
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,280
only about 20% of the issue.

503
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,520
The other 80% is the mindset

504
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,880
that keeps us stuck in those habits

505
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,760
and doing those things

506
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,040
in the same way we're doing them.

507
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,480
And so, if we don't look at the mindset

508
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,400
that is causing the behavior,

509
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,720
then you'll just see it

510
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,480
repeating itself over and over again.

511
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,360
And so, when we go into the mindset

512
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:53,960
and look at

513
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,560
what's yucky about that,

514
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,320
what's the most dangerous thing

515
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,360
about sending an email

516
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,200
that's not totally flashed out,

517
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,200
or that it may not have vetted

518
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,440
with ten people or whatever.

519
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
What we tend to come up with is,

520
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,360
well, people will think I look stupid.

521
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,160
Okay, what's bad about looking stupid?

522
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,200
Well, if I look stupid,

523
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,400
then people will think I'm a failure.

524
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,560
They won't trust me.

525
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,280
So, when we get down

526
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,440
to these deeper levels,

527
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,760
it is always about an identity

528
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,760
that we think we need to hold on to.

529
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,200
Some way that we believe

530
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,920
we need to show up in this world,

531
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,800
that we are so deeply attached to,

532
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,680
and if we don't show up this way,

533
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,320
then we risk no longer belonging.

534
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,240
We risk our worthiness.

535
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,800
And so, when we can detach ourselves

536
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,880
from that fear story,

537
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,440
then it becomes so much better.

538
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,080
Like, okay. Great.

539
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,880
So, I sent an email

540
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,520
that maybe not everybody loved

541
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,880
and some people might disagree with it,

542
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,520
but it doesn't impact my worthiness.

543
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,640
It just impacts this one thing.

544
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,160
Right. And I'm sure that so many people

545
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,480
who will be watching this

546
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,120
can resonate either on the micro level

547
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,880
or the macro level

548
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,320
with the things

549
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,280
that you're describing here.

550
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,520
What are some tangible things

551
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,560
that the average person can do

552
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,480
to help get over these fears?

553
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,840
Or at least try to embrace them

554
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,960
and understand that they exist?

555
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,640
Yeah. So, what I always encourage anybody,

556
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,680
whether you're, well,

557
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,960
most of us have goals,

558
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,000
things that we want to accomplish

559
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
whether it's losing weight

560
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,760
or it's taking on a new role

561
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,560
or it's just making more time for yourself

562
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,400
or creating more balance

563
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,600
in your work schedule,

564
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,960
so, whatever the goal is,

565
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,160
think about that goal

566
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,360
and then ask yourself:

567
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,640
what are the things I'm doing

568
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,840
that do not support me actually

569
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,880
accomplishing that goal?

570
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,640
So, for instance,

571
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,800
I'll say balance, work schedule.

572
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,040
Most of us over achievers

573
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,120
tend to like create a lot more time

574
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,400
on our work than we do

575
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,560
making time for our families.

576
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,840
Well, what am I not doing?

577
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,520
Well, I'm checking email

578
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,440
first thing in the morning.

579
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,080
I am emailing people back on the weekends.

580
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,360
I'm sending emails late.

581
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,480
I'm working on decks on the weekend,

582
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,720
whatever all of those things are.

583
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,840
Then we have to start asking ourselves,

584
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,680
what if I didn't do any of that stuff;

585
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,280
what would that make me feel;

586
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,040
how would I feel about that

587
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,960
if I just stopped;

588
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,560
if I actually just did what I wanted to do

589
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,920
and actually just create a balance;

590
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,560
what is yucky about that actual feeling;

591
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,800
and what we tend to realize is,

592
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,320
Oh, well, I have to do that

593
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,280
because what would people think

594
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,440
if I didn't reply back to them.

595
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,000
They might think that I'm ignoring them;

596
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,520
or they might think

597
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,440
that I'm not trustworthy;

598
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,360
or they might question my ability

599
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,920
to do the work, or whatever it is.

600
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,280
And again,

601
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,640
as we get to those deeper layers,

602
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,360
we start to see some of the

603
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,960
identity related things.

604
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,160
And when we start to see

605
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,640
what those identity related fears are,

606
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,840
then we start to see

607
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,000
how that's keeping us really stuck.

608
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,880
And so, it's always like asking yourself

609
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,640
what is yucky about or scary

610
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,320
or uncomfortable about

611
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,360
dropping all of the things I'm doing

612
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,520
that keep me safe.

613
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,440
Definitely.

614
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,880
Are there some higher level trends

615
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,240
that we're observing

616
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,160
as the workforce is dramatically changing

617
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,480
and obviously things are becoming

618
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,000
more and more and more competitive

619
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,960
as the time goes by?

620
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,840
I believe that most recently,

621
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,240
at least in Silicon Valley,

622
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,680
the number of years that somebody spends

623
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,560
in a tech company

624
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,080
is about two, three years,

625
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,520
which I think just adds

626
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,400
on to the stress levels of continuously

627
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,480
to improve and to gain to new heights.

628
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,440
Even though it's not something that

629
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,320
we might be actually passionate about.

630
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,440
Are there some higher level trends

631
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,600
that you're observing

632
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,000
or that we should be worried about

633
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,440
or optimistic about?

634
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,560
Well, what I am observing,

635
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,080
I'll speak specifically

636
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,800
to what you just mentioned,

637
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,560
is this idea that

638
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,680
we need to keep trading up

639
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,160
and things will get better as we trade.

640
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,560
Like, for instance, a lot of people

641
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
that I worked with at Google

642
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,360
left Google to go to competitors

643
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,640
thinking it's going to be better.

644
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,960
They had been at Google for a long time,

645
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,720
it's going to be better

646
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,600
when I go to this new place.

647
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,920
And it didn't get better.

648
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,160
It was the same thing

649
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,920
with slightly different scenery.

650
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,280
And that's what people find

651
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,240
over and over again.

652
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,000
It doesn't matter whether you're in tech

653
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,560
or in other companies.

654
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,360
And so, when we realize that the change

655
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,080
doesn't come from the outside,

656
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,720
that really is an invitation

657
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,040
for us to go inside, and again,

658
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,040
shift our mindset.

659
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,920
Because the scenery

660
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,640
is just may look a little bit different,

661
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,120
but it's going to feel the same way

662
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,800
as long as we keep those same mindsets.

663
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,600
And I just think it's getting

664
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,200
it's becoming more obvious,

665
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,080
and I think people

666
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,640
are starting to recognize some of their

667
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,520
limiting habits and patterns.

668
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,120
Especially because we have this

669
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,720
pressure cooker of being at home

670
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,000
and talking at Zoom

671
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,800
and all the other stuff

672
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,200
that's happening in the world right now.

673
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,000
Definitely. Definitely.

674
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,080
Erika, I want to thank you

675
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,640
for being so generous with your time.

676
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,720
This is wonderful.

677
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,560
Before we leave,

678
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,760
I have to ask you for three words

679
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,960
that you would use to describe yourself.

680
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,760
Okay. I would say energetic.

681
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,360
Energetic.

682
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,080
Probably really really energetic.

683
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,760
Let's see.

684
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,280
Divergent.

685
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,000
Why divergent?

686
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,440
So, I call it divergent

687
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,120
because I used to think that, like,

688
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,840
I needed to ignore the parts of me

689
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,760
that didn't really fit in with the mold.

690
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,840
And the more that I realized

691
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,960
that especially, there are so many people

692
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
that are high achievers

693
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,400
and really intelligent people that think,

694
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,600
well, this part of me

695
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,800
doesn't really make sense

696
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,120
with the rest of me.

697
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,640
And so many of us,

698
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,400
when we give ourselves

699
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,080
to actually give ourselves permission

700
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,760
to be our full selves,

701
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,080
we are way cooler people.

702
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,080
And so, I say I'm divergent

703
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,640
because I'm highly spiritual and I have

704
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,400
a very perverted sense of humor.

705
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,480
I used to think those two things

706
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,600
could not work together,

707
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,840
but they very much do

708
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,120
because they're part of me.

709
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,080
I love intense workouts.

710
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,360
And my favorite thing to do

711
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,480
is sit outside and do nothing all day.

712
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,480
So, I'm very divergent.

713
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,520
And the third would be passionate.

714
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,320
I love it.

715
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,160
Okay. Erika, thank you so so much.

716
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,560
This was insightful and wonderful.

717
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,080
And best of luck on the journey.

718
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,040
And thank you for being very open

719
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,520
and honest about your own journey.

720
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,640
Yeah. Thank you so much for having me.

721
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,440
I'm really really thrilled

722
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,400
to have been here.

723
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,360
Best of luck to you as well.

724
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:08,000
Take care.
