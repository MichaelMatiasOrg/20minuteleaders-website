All right. Lisandro Brill, thank you so much for joining me on the show. I really, really appreciate it. Thank you. Pleasure. It's so great to have you. I'm so excited to learn as much as I can over these next 20 minutes about your so, so fascinating life. As a journalist, television, and then going on to venture capital. You've made some incredible investments, An expert on Latin America. And I just want to hear as many stories as I can fit into these 20 minutes. Lisandro, take me back to your days of journalism. Who are you? I studied economics at the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina and never expected to be a journalist. But I started as a journalist in economic section of a major newspaper, Argentina. But I never want to be a journalist. So, I made my degree at Harvard USA. Afterwards came back to Argentina, As everybody does, of course. Well, there's a second-class University there at the East Coast of the United States. Then I came back to Argentina and I became unexpectedly when I was 32 years old, Undersecretary of State for Foreign Trade for the nation. And this was absolutely unexpected for me after I graduated from Harvard. And during my 10 years tenure at the government, I reached a conclusion that really the problem that I was facing Latin America was that there was not investment capital for pushing the talent of Latin America towards global markets. And this was venture capital. So, wait wait. Explain to me. So, dumb it down for me. You're sitting there. You're working within the government, You're overlooking what's happening. And what is this realization again? You realized that the innate problem of the emerging markets is that there's just not enough venture capital? I would say that for emerging markets that want to expand themselves into value added products, into innovation. There was no venture capital. Okay. And I thought that venture capital was a crazy idea that, because when I was the student at Harvard, there was a guy there that invented the tools to do the simulation of the cases. And so I plugged in his software, was a classmate of mine in my Apple II 1764K This was in 1980. And this was the invention of the electronic spreadsheet. It didn't exist the electronic spreadsheet. This was invented as under the name of BICS and CALP. Yeah. You were not born. Nope. Afterwards came MultiPlan. After cames Lotus. And Lotus was fantastic. Because you could key in your keyboard and transform a bunch of numbers into a graph interactively. And this was Lotus. I know this is all story. Everybody now is under Excel. But the concept of electronic spreadsheet was invented at a Harvard Business School. Between a person that wanted to save time in preparing the cases. And a guy from MIT. I crossed the river to the Kennedy School of Government. And imagine what happened. There was a huge discussion there. Huge discussion was, well, listen, this was 1980. Listen, who owns the patent? And the discussion was the patent should be owned. One-third by the inventor. One-third by the laboratory of the Harvard University. And one-third by the university endowment as a whole. And when this was fixed, how to split the ownership of the patent, the guy receiving millions of dollars to develop a genome project. So, I thought this is crazy ideas that happen only in the States. But I came back to Argentina, Latin America. I realized that even Latin America wants to develop a different area of innovative projects in technology. We should join the venture capital world. And so, I started a venture capital in 1989 when-- Lisandro, I just want to point out that, we almost just went past it. But you were sitting there working, meeting and discussing entrepreneurship with the person that invented the technology behind the first spreadsheets. But you were getting this inspiration. And you're sitting and you're understanding. Wow, all this entrepreneurial spirit here in Cambridge. Why don't we have this in Latin America? You arrived there in 1989. What is the entrepreneurial scene over there? And what is the venture capital scene when you go back over there? Oh, Listen. Venture capital didn't exist in Latin America at all. I'm one of the founders of Endeavour, which is an NGO that promotes entrepreneurship in Latin America. Is the equivalent of a government foundation. When this was invented, a rich one guy, This was in 1998, There wasn't entrepreneur. Wow. And so, a guy I was receiving his office by the assistant. And the assistant say, "Listen, there's here a guy on the name of [Peter Kember], [Alitha Rothenburg] from US that comes with Lisandro Brill. They want to do venture capital. They are here with a backpack. They are very nice people. Very nice. I do not want what they do. It seemed that venture capital is something like adventure tourism in Patagonia, Latin America. So, people didn't understand a clue of what venture capital was about. And when I wanted to reach A family office. This happened to me also in 1992. Explaining what venture capital. That we have to do incubation for startups. After a 20-minute discussion. The guy that was an older said, "Listen, I still do not understand. In this incubator what kind of chicken you are growing?" So, venture capital world did not exist in Latin America. I would say 1998 with all the boom of the Internet that was developed with E-commerce just blew out. Right. And so, I was able to raise my first fund. My first one was underwritten by Hicks Muse Tate & Furst out of Dallas, Texas. They were in love with Argentina. They love Buenos Aires. They love entrepreneurial spirit. They loved it. I say, "How is it possible?" We have to bring that right through there? And this was their very first venture capital firm, I would say, in Latin America. We invested $20 million. And one of the first companies we invested is very well known by you. Because it came out from Stanford University, Founded by a guy on the name of Marcos Galperin who just did a copy of eBay, Amazon and created MercadoLibre. MercadoLibre today in Latin America, which you saw only 6% or 7% of Latin America is under e-commerce. But today is valued $49 billion and is just eating the market of retail in the region. Not only with e-commerce, but also, with financial services. So, this provides an example that entrepreneurship can happen this part of the world that can develop if adequate funding is available. Especially if you have funds. And we see some GPs in partners that know how to grow companies. Of course. And now you're actually co-founder of the Latin America segment of J-Ventures, which were both a part of. Correctly. Because my family came from prosecutive, from programs from Ukraine in 1905. So, there is a Jewish community of 250 thousand peoples third after US in America is the following community of Jewish people. I belong to this community and I was very much really motivated by the vision of Oded Hermoni, Laura Laver and Jim Cosman to connect the diaspora of us people to help develop our threat in our community with the activity of doing business. Which is the same thing that my father did in 1950s. I remember my father when he used to go around the world doing business in trade. I said, "Father, but you don't speak English." And he said, "Well, it is the belief." "Because I do speak English." Do you trust my English? Yes. Yes, I do. So, he created businesses. Because he knocked on with the Jewish community around the world. Is an old tradition of our community. Yes. Okay, Lisandro, give me your insight into the Latin America entrepreneurial and venture capital scene today. Coming in from Israel and from the US, I don't get exposed too much to what's happening in Latin America. And the closest I've been there is to go around and meet entrepreneurs and VCs in Mexico, to try and get a little bit of the taste of what are the challenges of emerging markets. Because is it considered an emerging market, a developing market that is still not matured yet? I'm assuming it is. But I just want to make sure. Venture capital is embryonic in Latin America. It's very easy. Latin America is 600 million people. 50% is Brazil. That's you speak Portuguese. 50% is Spanish speaking Latin America. And the most important countries are Brazil and Portuguese, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, and afterwards, the rest. So, venture capital is starting Latin America. By far the most important country is Brazil. We have minimum 30 funds in Brazil. Very much supported originally by the government. But also, by the investors from the Silicon Valley. You have Kaszek, Monashees, Redpoint are the names of the games here. In Mexico I am a partner with AltaVentures, and Dalus capital. They are based there a venture partner in Dallas and is a smaller country. But I would say that Brazil and Mexico are the two only countries in Latin America that can develop the J-curve of venture capital. That means companies domestically that can grow to the size of being big plays. So, for example, we have our most famous case may be a NuBank. That is $40 billion market cap. Is a FinTech company in Brazil. But you have a Didi's, which is the Uber originally of Brazil that was sold to Didi in China for a billion dollars. And you have in Mexico companies such as Clip That is a square, In the US, they are valued well above about half a billion dollars today. And of course, this is a part of the story, which is deals basically with IT. With software. I am not pushing a lot, bringing Israeli technologies and Silicon Valley technologies invested by J-Ventures to Latin America in the AgriFood tech space. You have a nice company there in J-Ventures based in Monteview of Palo Alto on the name of Big Hero that is trying to enter Latin America. Because they do colonization and they increase the productivity of crops by 30%. Incredible. I think how much contribution you can make to food security around the world. And saving these around the world. Yeah. Of course. Of course. Of course. And Argentina and Brazil are great places for crop production. We can feed in the world minimum two billion people. And we are only, let's say, 200 million people, 250 million people inhabitant. So, we have the capacity because you have the technology there. You have the artificial intelligence. But in order to embed proteins into something that is called food, you need land and water so far. And Israel and California have land or water to feed and create these proteins. This is being done here in South America as a major destination. So, what do you just, I just want to clarify. You just said that Latin America there are places that accumulates to about the population of 200 million. But the land and the potential is to grow food that can feed two billion? Yes, I yes. Because Argentina's a country of 40 million people, has land and water with adequate technology to feed the billion people. It sounds like a gold mine. It sounds like these places have so much incredible potential that why are entrepreneurs wasting their time here in Palo Alto building in new social apps for millions of people? If they can go to Latin America and work on problems that can feed billions. It sounds like it's a much better idea to go to Latin American and do technology there, no? Well, it's an untapped continent. So, I would say that our role, your role Matias, is the role of J-Ventures, It's exactly to connect these communities, with the philosophy of Ticuna land. Yes, of course, As Oded like to say Oded Hermoni likes to say, as Laura Logan likes to say, as Ronald Cohen likes to say, That we listened to him last week. And of course, there is a lot of opportunity in as much as you bother with people that know how to cope with our characteristics. Because you take a New York guy that went to Harvard or to Stanford and he lands in Be'er Sheva and he lands in Tel Aviv. I am sure that he will not go with their shoes holds back. [--] He would have to adapt. He would have to partner. So, I would say that the secret is to have a global thinking, to capture opportunity. And you have the knowledge and experience to act locally, to deliver globally. Wonderful. Okay, Lisandro, So, you know, I came to Stanford from my military service. A lot of my friends went to go do startups and go work. But I felt that I didn't understand what are the biggest problems that the world needs to be solved? And what are the biggest things in Ticuna land that I can do that are both profitable, but also have a great net positive impact for the world. And so, I'm taking up on this offer. I'm finishing here-- If it's about food. It's about health. It's about housing. Okay. So, Lisandro the deal is that I'm finishing up this degree here and then I'm coming to Latin America, I'm taking you as a mentor and you're showing me how I can use deep technology to solve big problems in your continent. More than welcome. I am in debt of you. OK. Wonderful. Okay, Lisandro, amazing. We have this on record, So, this is fantastic. But I want to spend the next five minutes or so talking about your passions. What are you truly excited about as an investor, as an entrepreneur, as a thinker, as a Ticuna lawmaker? My passion is human development and progress. What does that mean? Human development and progress is to live in a world where basic needs in terms of nutrition, 15 [--] calories per person. Education. 15 years of education, guaranteed Health. Access to health as you have in Israel. [--] They are in California. And let's say 25 square meters per person for living Once you have these, you are assured that you have the freedom to choose and become a free person. A citizen of the world. I love this. And do you know who invented this concept of developing economics with these human development approach? This was invented in Silicon Valley by a guy who was a human psychologist on the name Maslow. I was just about to say the Maslow pyramid, which talks about this idea that you need the foundations before you can reach fulfillment. So, my passion is to connect venture capital with it. Abraham Maslow pyramid, To develop human needs. To push for human freedom on a global scale. And this is the only, in my judgment, a guarantee for security. Wow. Unbelievable. So, does that guide your investment strategy and the types of projects that you're working on? Obviously, you're taking up your precious time and you're working also with the J-Ventures, an early stage fund. But is this from in the mindset of I'm going to take on projects that have the potential to reach meaningful net positive outcomes on human lives? I am always fascinated by impact investing. During the 90s, early this century, impact investing, the name of the game was creating great companies, creating big companies and creating Endeavor, my NGO that we invented in Argentina. Now we are in 25 countries around the world to promote economic development. But as of today I will say that creating this world has not been enough. Now we have applied to this technology to which called impact investing, which is what we have heard. J-Ventures from Ronald Cohen. Yes. About the environment sustainable that have inclusion potential to feed people, to nurture people, to provide for health. And no doubt that food tech and health tech would be major areas of investment. Because for me, the offices, institutional investors, are pushing the venture capital private equity industry to invest in the things that make the world more sustainable. 100%. Lisandro, That's just so inspiring to hear. Before we leave and I can't believe 20 minutes are almost up. We have just a minute left. But I want to know your three words that you would use to describe yourself. And I'd love an explanation about them, because I think that your your mindset is fascinating. Your ambitions are incredible. And I just love this notion of going through your journey both as an entrepreneur, venture capital, you non-government worker. With the mindset of improving humanity and freeing the people from the shackles of a food, of water, of health, of living. So, please Lisandro, three words that best describe you. Passion for human development, fellow for world security. Ticuna land. Okay. So, ticuna land. It's all about that. It's all about that impact. Right? Right. Okay. Lisandro one tip that you would give me or any other entrepreneur that starting their journey. Impact investing and Ticuna land is not necessarily in the mindset of every young entrepreneur today going into this world. So what is one thing that I should keep in mind as I go through my path? Travel. Know the world. Connect deeply with the people around the world. Because you have a fantastic background coming from Israel. You can connect your world. The Stanford world with these people. And we are now sure that we live in a global system where everything is interconnected. It's the time of the pandemics of covid. It's the time that people realize that we are in one world and we have to connect to each other in a positive sum game. 100%, 100%. Lisandro, toda raba. Thank you so, so much. Thank you for the inspiration. Thank you for everything you're doing. And I'm gonna see you on Latin America when we worked together. Come here more than welcome. Of course. Take care Lisandro Thank you very much. Bye bye.
