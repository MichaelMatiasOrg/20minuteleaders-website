1 Stav Erez, thank you for joining me on my show for the second time. How are you? I'm good. Thank you for having me. Of course. Of course. Okay. So, just today we have the huge fires all over California. So, I appreciate you being flexible. And hopefully by the time that this airs, there will be no more fires. But in any case, thank you for joining me. With pleasure. Wonderful. Wonderful. Okay. So, I have to start again from the fun fact, because it's so much fun. And the first fun fact that you told me about is the fact that you're able to hold boiling pots without getting burned. How is that possible? Or with getting burned by without feeling pain, actually. Yeah, I just don't feel it. So, basically, you can say I'm a hero and this is my superpower. I just I can hold it and don't feel anything. I will still burn though. You will still burn. You actually showed me before that you had some burn marks. But I have to understand. Literally you can go and hold a boiling pot, but you're not going to feel the pain? Yup. That's just unbelievable. That's just the first one. The second one, which you have an interesting story back from the Army and you discover by chance that you're colorblind. Now, I have to understand, first of all, how is it possible that only at the age of 18 or 19, you get to a point where you understand that you're colorblind? It must not be that severe, right? So, I don't know about severe. But I was always told that I have really bad taste in clothes. So, but yeah, in the army, just like I was in the intelligence force and everybody is writing something from the board and looking to the left, to my right, I really don't understand what's happening. And then I just realized that I don't see anything because I'm colorblind, which makes sense. My father is colorblind. For females, it's pretty rare. You need both parents. Interesting. Okay. So, you need both parents to be colorblind for females to be colorblind. It's called the gene at least. You have to have that recessive gene, I guess, right? Unbelievable. Okay. So, Stav, you're an investor and entrepreneur. You ran an accelerator. You're very knowledgeable about the Israeli ecosystem, but specifically about the Jerusalem tech ecosystem, which I'm especially curious about. And today you're investing with Labs/02. So, I'd love to start off with their journey. Take me back to the old days when you were just starting out your entrepreneurial experience in Jerusalem. How do you make your way? What are the biggest milestones towards you becoming an investor as a part of Labs? Walk me through those that journey. Sure. So, basically, I consider myself to be a social entrepreneur. Back in 2012, I co-founded Siftech. I was the CEO. It was the first entrepreneurship center and the first accelerator in Greater Jerusalem. Basically, our mission was to help young people like us stay in the city. And build companies and startups. And there were no startups in the city back then. So, you're saying, like any pitch, Like what is the pain point? Like why do you have to create different mechanisms to have people stay in Jerusalem? I love Jerusalem. Why would people leave it? So, I think that the biggest problem for young people was basically employment. And so, you can work for the government. But if you want to do anything else and if you have an idea and you want to become an entrepreneur and Israeli startup nation, you basically, would have to pack your bags and move to Tel Aviv. Because this was the only ecosystem in Israel. And we wanted people to be able to stay in Jerusalem, although they want to become entrepreneurs. And we thought that this is a big, maybe a major milestone to develop Jerusalem economy. So, we did that in 2012. Later on, we were, a part of the group is founded a community of entrepreneurs in Jerusalem. I think that the next milestone was JNEXT. Back then, it was the prime minister's office, the Jerusalem Development Authority and the Jerusalem municipality. So, I founded the project to develop Jerusalem economy through high tech entrepreneurship. My next stop was at OurCrowd. Okay. To build basically the platform for value creation. To connect all the tens of thousands of accredited investors to the portfolio companies for business development purposes. But not only, for also for deal flow due diligence and stuff like that. And then I gave birth the day after we launched the platform. The day after you launched. Wow. Yeah. During OurCrowd's summit. It was on the Thursday. And I really remember John telling everybody, I was the last speaker and like, you just wait, maybe we're going to have like live birth on stage. Luckily we didn't. Only the day after. Wow. Unbelievable. And then, during my maternity leave, I realized that basically my dream is to do venture creation. To build companies based on academic institutions, IP. And then we founded Labs/02. So, we're an early stage seed fund and incubator. And we invest in early stage companies. But also we do venture creation. And we have a partnership with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. And we're working with a professors and doctors to really try to see how we can take their technology and turn it into a company. Fascinating. So, I am aware that the default way of starting a company is you have a couple of people who are coming together, they agree on a problem, then they think of a solution and they go and bring that and hopefully find a good go to market and a product market fit. But what you're saying here is that with a venture creation, a lot of times you are going into these academic institutions and you're taking technology and solutions that don't necessarily even have a problem in it and you're finding ways to adapt them. Is that the way that it works? Basically, yeah. It's not only that. It's also like build a team. So, it's everything. It's really understanding the technology. Trying to think what you can do in it. Usually you have plenty of ways of solutions and problems that it can solve. Do market research. Talk a lot with the industry and try to understand exactly which is the biggest problem that they're solving. The biggest mean. And then bring in, along with the professor, the relevant team. Usually, by the way, the professor stays in the academic. Not usually. It's always. He stays in the university. He becomes an adviser to scientists officer. Okay. And then, So, how is that lifecycle different than the regular startup? So, you're helping them do the market research, form a team. And then maybe down the line, invest, I guess. Because it sounds like in the beginning is more of the mentorship type of engagement. And then, it becomes a pre-seed and a seed stage investment? Yes. We're really working with them for a period of time. This takes time. Usually when a company comes and they pitch, so, it will take a couple of weeks, a couple of months tops to decide to invest. Here, we're talking about a process that can take up to a year. But when we're happy with the results, we're putting in the money and we can move forward. So, then, how do you divide your time? Because it sounds like, if you have a few of those ventures that are almost a year long process and there's only a finite amount of time and resources that Labs/02 can provide, how do you divide that up? So, we invest in around six companies per year. We won't do more than two venture creations per year. Okay. So, the venture creation is even more selective than the investments? For sure. It takes time. We can't really do six like VC. I wish I could. But I really can't. Right. 100%. So, one of the things that we talked about before, which was really interesting to me, is this sort of the dos and don'ts of an early entrepreneur going to the first investors. And I'd love to get your take on your impression, having met so many entrepreneurs and so many companies. What are some of the pitfalls that you notice that young entrepreneurs make as they start their journey and approach their first institutional funding? So, I actually, have a full lecture about it. But I'll maybe pick, like the best ones. So, I think that the first one is really, that it's all about the personal connection. So, a lot of the times entrepreneurs come. They sit down, they connect to the computer and they start to talk. "So, the problem we're solving and a solution and..." "Guys, wait for a second. Let's talk." It's like a relationship. It's not an interview, right? You need to form a connection with the person. Because if I'm going to invest, I'm going to work very closely with you. I want to make sure not only that you know what you're talking about, that you're tackling a relevant problem, that your solution is good. I want to find out, first of all, who are you. And are you the kind of person that I want to work with. So, just start by getting to know the person. And maybe, it can lead me to how to really connect and how to approach. So, a more introduction, I think, is always the best way to go. But I think it's really important to say that even if you don't, you can't find form of introduction, a cold email is okay. Just do your research. So, go and see my interview, for example, for 20 minutes and just write something about something specifically I said that, I don't know, clicked. Go to try and find out if the investor wrote anything. He did a tech talk. Go into his portfolio companies and see which kind of company he invests in. So, when you're writing an email, a cold email, by the way that's fine, But just make sure it's not the same email you're sending everyone. Because if an investor gets an email that he sees that everyone got the same email and it's a cold email, he's probably going to pass from scratch. So, this is like a small something that you can do pretty much right away. I think that another thing is that you must be proficient in what you do. So, I know that a lot of people are starting with, like a story about themselves and how they encountered a problem. But I really don't think that that's enough that you encounter the problem. It really needs to be something that you dealt with, you worked with. Not just something that occurred one day. But something that time, you thought a lot about it. You're proficient in the field that you're talking about. I think that this is super important. I think that even for pre-seed and seed investors, it's very important to do as much as you can by yourself. So, by the way it's fine to come to an investor with a presentation only. But also with the presentation, just show that you gave this some thoughts. That you did your research. As much research as possible. If I know more about the subject than you do, that's not a good thing. So, really do as much as possible. And I understand that not everyone can really put everything on hold and now focus solely on their company and build it from scratch. And that's okay. You don't have to get to paying customers. But as much as you can try to do on your own. But there is something that speaks to this idea of being scrappy and bootstrapping and being able to leverage whatever minimal resources you have starting out and coming with some good foundation, not necessarily with paying customers. A lot of times investors don't even expect to see that up until the seed or the series-A. But at least coming with proof that you as a team can leverage whatever small resources a pre-seed investor can provide you. Because those few hundred thousand dollars or those few million dollars, they're not going to be the deciding factor of whether you're able to execute well. They might help you get there. But at the end, the team, it's how you leverage those minimal resources, right? Exactly. And we're taking a risk, right. You're sitting in front of us and you're selling us a dream. By the way, I love the job as being an investor. Specifically in the pre-seed seed. I don't need to start like, I'm not going to the excel one. Okay. You're  [--]. I see the hockey stick. I get to see the people's dream. So, like, that's the best ever, right? But I'm still taking a risk. And I do want to see that you took some risk, as well. So, just try to do as much as possible. I want to say something else. Just food for thought. So, I see the relationship like I mentioned earlier, I see it as a two way street. So, it's not only that you're coming in and you need to impress me and sell. I really do think that what you can do for me, if you're asking an investor what he can do for you is super valid question. And I want to see more entrepreneurs actually ask this. I want them to understand that they don't only need money, they need to value. And to choose investors based on the value. So, I will say I had a couple of companies that I said "no" to, not because they weren't good. Not because I didn't have the personal connection. Just because I thought that I wasn't the right investor. I didn't think that I can bring additional extra added value. That's important. So, this is just a tip that when you approach investors, come with the confidence. Understand that you're coming into a marriage and you're choosing the person as much as he's choosing you. Right. Stav, what is your number one turn off? That when somebody approach a VC, you see a lot of companies. What is that one thing that really makes you tick and not perhaps just you, but the average investor? Maybe arrogance and probably, the biggest problem, I think, is lack of diversity. So, I think that a lot of the time you can see when it's a group of men only just because they still haven't recruited the relevant people. But this is part of their culture or just because they're men. Like men and that's it. I think that this is by the way, I think this is a big problem for our industry. The lack of diversity is, for me, it's the big problem. Definitely. And this is something that comes up often in the series. And a lot of others that I've spoken with, we spoke extensively about the role of, the responsibility of having diversity from both the investor side, but also the founder side. And on the opposite side of this question of what makes you tick, what really makes you excited? So, what happens that makes you really excited when you meet a new entrepreneur and you're like, wow, this is somebody that I might really want to work with. So, when they're super super excited about what they're doing and when, I really love crazy ideas, basically. So, the crazier, the better from my perspective. But really, when you see like this, I don't know, this professor from the university, and he's coming. And he's talking to you about like quantum physics. And he's super excited and he's sure that this is the most exciting topic in the world. I'm excited as well. I love it. I love it. I remember I had a great conversation with Dror Berman, from Innovation Endeavors a while back. And their whole thesis is moonshot ideas. And I was just so inspired by this notion of investing based on the idea that you're only going to go for the companies that have a shot at changing the world. In a really substantial way. So, I love this idea of the crazier the better. But Stav, you give a tip that for anybody who wants to approach Labs/02 should should get to know you better. So, I'd love to get to know you better myself. Hopefully one day I'll also come and pitch a company to you. But talk to me a little bit about what you're passionate about. So, you see all these different companies, all the different industries, what really makes you excited about the entrepreneurship world and what types of projects do you really get excited about? Okay. So, I have to say this, we're pretty generalists. So, we're excited about a lot of things. But we are looking to solve big problems. You call it shooting to the moon. And I actually, I love it. So, it's really hard for me to pick a specific sector. But I think, what gets me excited, if it's like big ideas that are going to change the world, I love the fact that in each one of my portfolio companies, I can really see the impact. We're not impact investors. This is not what we base our decision upon. But still, like if you go through my portfolio company, you can actually see like the how they're going to affect and change something in the world. Each and every one of them. So, this on my personal level, this gets me excited. So, I love the fact that people are thinking, like, beyond. Okay. So, you were telling me a little bit about the portfolio, I missed that a little bit. So, just go back and we'll figure out how to stitch it together properly. Okay. So, we are pretty much generalists. So, there's not one sector that I could tell that this is our sweet spot. Although, I'm super excited about NeuroTech. I think that this is the future. But I think we're excited about people that are coming that are trying to solve big problems. That are coming with futuristic ideas. And on a personal note, I love the fact that if you look at my portfolio, you can find the impact that each and every company does. So, take me back to the portfolio companies. You're agnostic. You're generalists. This time I'm going to hear you. Okay. So, we're pretty generalists. We're looking for people that are solving the big problem, futuristic, with deep technology. But on a personal note, I really like companies that has an impact. We're not an impact fund. But I love the fact that if you look at our portfolio companies, you'll see that each one of them really is making an impact. And a sector I would say that my new passion is maybe NeuroTech. So, I love that. Okay. What do you love about that? Why specifically that? I think that this is a field that it's only in the beginning. And I think that's we're going to see much more. We know very little about our brain. So, we have a lot more to explore. And I love the fact that until today, I think that most of the companies that we saw was very, you had to put something on your head. Not to say, in your head. And we're now going to a phase where it's going to be non-invasive completely. So, you're going to be able to just make your brain work better without really hurting him. So, that's interesting. I love it. Okay. So, along the same lines of getting to know you, I have to ask you the most important question. Which is three words that you would use to describe yourself, and why those three specific words? Okay. So, I would say I'm an entrepreneur. I really like to build things. I have to say that I don't really like to met with them afterwards, but I like to build things. But that is why being an investor is really suits me. Right. Maybe the second word would be smile. So, I'm a very happy person and I smile a lot. And this is the way I want to live my life. So, when I was really young, my mother told me that if I'm not happy about something, just walk away. You don't have to stay in a place where you're not happy. And I did that. So, I smile most of the time, I think. And the last thing that described me, talk. So, basically it's really hard for me to shut up. I love it. Explain a little bit more. So, I think that I know a lot about a lot of topics. So, I can talk to you about all these kinds of different things. If you try to go in depth to some of them, maybe it won't work as well. But I love it. So, we can jump from one topic to another. And I can really hold a conversation for a couple of hours. I love it. Stav, thank you very much for your time and generosity. Thank you for staying with all the mishaps, with the fires and the Internet. But we managed to get this. And this was just wonderful and very insightful. And stay safe and stay healthy. Thank you very much. You too. Bye. Wonderful.
