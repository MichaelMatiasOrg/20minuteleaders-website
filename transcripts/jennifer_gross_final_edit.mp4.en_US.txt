1 I think no one more than me wants to get back to in-person meetings, because for me this is a relationship business and that's why I love what I do. That's why I love getting up every morning and coming to work, because I love having these meaningful conversation. Jennifer Gross, thank you so much for being on my show, 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? Wonderful, Michael. Thank you. I'm so happy to be here today. I'm very excited to hear about fundraising, about American Friends of Tel Aviv University, the great work that you're doing there, and really getting into the mindset of what it means to be that helpful for both a research institution. But I believe it's Israel's largest university by in terms of more than 30,000 students? That's correct. We are Israel's largest university and covering basically every discipline you can think of. Okay. So, I'm excited to learn more about Tel Aviv University in itself, but I'd love to start out with a little bit about you. Coming all the way from investment banking. I understand that you have quite a bit of experience with fundraising over the years. So, obviously you're the perfect person for this job. Tell me a little bit about yourself all the way from North-Eastern, how do you make your way towards the financial world to get to be the CEO of this great organization and this non-profit? So, you're right, I started actually at Northwestern in Chicago. I started there and graduated, went to work for Morgan Stanley as an investment banking analyst and did that program for two years. Concluding that program, I move to institutional money management marketing, the [--] product of a company that was a wholly owned sub of Credit Suisse. And from there, it was home with my two children, now 23 and 25 year olds for 10 years. During that time, I got very involved in nonprofit, and I guess, as a proxy for working professionally and needing to have my own time, I got very involved volunteering. So, I took on all kinds of volunteer roles. But the common theme throughout those roles was really it was about raising money. And my feeling was kind of where the rubber hits the road, in order to help the people, it's about the money. So, I get sort of cut my teeth in fundraising as a volunteer from many different organizations are synagogue, my children's school, some Israeli organizations federation in New York City. And spent about 10 years doing that. And as my children get older, they were in Jewish Day school, so their day was pretty long. And it became clear to me that they didn't really need me at home anymore. And sort of at the end of my time being home with them, they between after school activities and playdates with friends, they were sort of busy until 7:00 at night. So, I saw that this is really my opportunity to be able to go back to work. Before you continue, I need to understand a little bit about the context of fundraising. What does it mean to raise funds? Because I'm coming from the startup world, from the venture capital world, where it's very obvious what fundraising is. It's a more of a transactional type of deal. It's a partnership that we're going to also expect a return. But the type of fundraising that you're dealing with doesn't necessarily expect a monetary return. So, talk to me about the, what is the process of raising funds as a nonprofit? So for me, fundraising is is really a relationship building. It's all about relationship building. It's Michael, you're a philanthropist and you're looking to achieve certain goals philanthropically. And how are we, Tel Aviv University, best in class partners for you to achieve that. Right. So, it's really having a conversation and getting to know the potential donor and what moves him or her and what they care about. And again, how we can help them realize or hopefully even exceed what they're trying to do. So the return, well, you're right, it's not, I sort of got my start in fundraising, raising money for hedge funds from institutions. And you're absolutely right with transactional. And they were looking to generate a certain return to be able to meet their needs. And this is very different. This is really about speaking to people who are philanthropically inclined and who want to, who have certain measures that they want to achieve and really either helping them zone in on exactly what that is or how to do it. Okay. So, it sounds to me that there are a few different verticals here. One of them is the people that are already considering themselves philanthropic. They're known as philanthropists. And then you're finding some sort of alignment between your mission, their mission, and then it's a win-win situation. But I'm sure there are also people that are not yet considered philanthropists, but they may have the means to contribute. They may have missions that are aligned and you're also tasked with trying to find those people and explain to them what philanthropy could be. Right? You're absolutely right. So, that oftentimes is a longer lead time, because that's not just talking to you, someone who cares about certain to achieve certain things philanthropically, but that's talking to you about really sort of that's a much larger conversation about values, what you value, what's important to you, what sort of legacy or what sort of impact you're looking to have. For people who aren't yet philanthropic, but to your point, have the ability to be philanthropic, it's really a conversation of sort of why is this the right thing to do, why is this the appropriate thing for you to do at this stage of your life, why you why not somebody else. And how can you feel so good about what you're doing and what you're making possible and the impact that you're having on others, which can seem sort of counterintuitive to iron the money. It's my money. So, sometimes there's a little bit of a golf that you have to transcend in terms of why being philanthropic is appropriate and not even just appropriate, but is really extraordinarily uplifting. So, why does a person become philanthropic? You're saying it's extremely rewarding, uplifting, but I don't think it's that obvious to the average person. Why spending money or donating money is automatically, you know, a rewarding, enriching experience? So, why does one become philanthropic? And what does one gain out of it? Because it is a two sided street. One becomes philanthropic, I guess, for one of two reasons. One is, they really feel like I've been given certain assets and certain resources and giving back is either something that I want to do or I feel is my responsibility to do, or is the right thing to do. So sort of internally motivated, the external motivation is sometimes about really introducing this person or people to the needs and to sort of the broader landscape out there. And I think pointing out the needs, the opportunities and the impact that that's possible. Because in my experience, I've seen that when you see, look, private philanthropy is dwarfed by governmental spending. But governmental spending, there are tremendous holes and there are governments, Institutions tend to like to fund specific projects, but without having the lights on and the staff paid and the copy machine serviced, you cannot run those programs. So, I think when people can see, assuming someone either is or is willing to become philanthropically minded, when people can see what private philanthropy can make possible, it becomes sort of addicting. And you realize the impact when you really get to meet the grantees or to see the programs and to see what it is that you can make possible, everybody loves spending on themselves and their families and trips and home or whatever it is, but this is totally different. And for those who have, I think there's a real argument to be made about, or I should say, the way that we've raised our children is sort of the measure to which you have is the measure to which you have a responsibility to give back. I love that. I love that. I have to say, growing up in both in Palo Alto, Tel Aviv, I'm right now a student at Stanford while also a senior associate of J-Ventures, and at the start of Hippo, I'm surrounded by people that are very, very motivated and ambitious. And a lot of these people are excited to go into the startup scene, potentially to be going towards an exit strategy or running a public company, a very successful one, or alternatively going into investment banking or other venture capital types of funds, all of which have high potential for making a lot of money. And when I asked them what would the motivation behind the money, very rarely do I hear, I want to be a philanthropist when I'm older, right? I want to be a philanthropist. Jen, I'm seeing the work that a lot of the brilliant people, like the top tech leaders, that they're spending large, sometimes large chunks of their money on having a positive impact on the world. And I can't help but get excited about potentially, if I do get a chance to have means for myself to be able to contribute as well, it sounds like a fantastic impact. But Jennifer, tell me a little bit about Tel Aviv university, what you're doing there from the United States. I believe you are one of the biggest donors, or the groups that are channeling funds towards Tel Aviv University, right? We are the largest donor to the university. Our support we raised I would say around $35,000,000 a year, which we send to Israel, to university. We're number one. And I'm proud to say that in addition to us being number one, Israel is number two. So, the Israeli philanthropic community, while it's younger and more, sort of in its infancy, has really and you've started to see Israelis with real means start to give. So, we're proud that that we're first and that Israel's second. I think that's something really significant. Israelis are seeing the potential and are investing in their university in the same way that Americans are investing in their universities. So, I think that's something that's critical. It's something that I haven't had since I was at Northwestern. And to get to the deans and the professors and the researchers and working in the labs and doing the kind of cutting edge work and innovation, it's just so generative and it's something that's so exciting. And I think it empowers all of us at the American Friends to be able to tell the story and to really try to convey what's going on, and the excitement and the possibilities, not just for changing what's going on in Israel on the ground, but really the ripple effect of the technology and the innovation and the discoveries at the university are really rippling out worldwide. And that's something that's, that's extraordinary. And when you speak to somebody about giving money and about being philanthropic, especially when you speak to someone in any aspect of the financial services industry, whether that's hedge funds or whether that's the startups or venture or angel or private equity, sort of anywhere in financial services, I think everyone's looking for impact. And what are the exciting things about investing in Israel? And not to say this is at the expense of anyone investing in their universities in the US, but that's sort of the purchasing power of a dollar in Israel versus in the US is just exponential. So, we, Tel Aviv University was fortunate that we're doing collaboration's through the correct foundation with Stanford. And so, it's not one to one, one researcher from Stanford, one from Tel Aviv, it's one to six. So, if you're philanthropic and if you're thinking about the impact and what your funds can do and how they can go further, that's definitely something that we see. We have somebody who has been giving multiple millions of dollars for cancer research in the US. And he just gave to Tel Aviv University because the ability to have an impact and for those research dollars to go even further exists in Israel in a way that it doesn't exist here. I think, that's just remarkable. But going to the beginning, why does the university need to raise funds? Why does a university need millions of dollars in order to operate? It's a great question because you ask yourself, you're the biggest university in Israel, you're public university, why isn't that the government's responsibility? It's a great question. And I would tell you that it is the government's responsibility. And the amount of money that the government gives the US, the amount of money that the government gives the university is it far exceeds any other sources of funds. And that those funds, that funding level gets universities to good. Tel Aviv university would be a good university. You would have access to good researchers and good equipment, but not great. The difference from good to great, the way that we're able to reverse the brain drain and to bring all the postdocs who go out of Israel because they have to do the postdoc work that's going to be really respected in academia to be able to bring them back and to be able to give them enough lab equipment and access to postdocs, all of that, that's really private philanthropy. That's where private philanthropy comes in. So, in order for the university to do all it can do for Israel and for the world, it's dependent on private philanthropy. Wow. So, it makes perfect sense. The donations are what bring good to great. And obviously, when I'm even trying to start comparing the endowment or the funds that, in places like Stanford or Harvard or MIT have compared to the numbers that you said before, you know, it's literally adding zeros at the end. Which is pretty remarkable considering that Tel Aviv University and other universities in Israel do such cutting edge technology. And we have some of the brightest people in the world. So, it's just phenomenal. What is your day to day look like, you and your team, as you're working towards helping Tel Aviv from the United States? Are we talking about pre-pandemic or post-pandemic? Oh, last year or both. So, pre-pandemic when I started, I set a goal for myself, which was in the first year to get out and meet all the members of our board. And the members, the university has a board of governors, to meet the members the members of the Board of Governors from the US, and to meet our major donors. So, I would say my day to day until March was basically on a plane, probably more often than not getting to San Francisco, to LA, to Chicago, to Miami, all over to Israel, to really meet people and really understand sort of their relationship to the university and opportunities and just really fill them in also with what we were doing. And that was a real focus. Well, then, sort of covid hit and everything had to pivot. And see that we took the opportunity, when I joined in my role, there had been sort of a gap. For 10 months there was no CEO. They have a CEO search on. And so, when I started, it became clear that we really needed some internal planning and structure in order to be as strong of an institution as we could be. So, when the pandemic hit, we took advantage of the opportunity or the lack of opportunity to travel and to have face to face meetings and really looked internally and started a strategic planning process where we came up with an overall organizational strategic plan, a fundraising plan, a communications plan where we really designed, with regards to the fundraising team, we designed what are their pipelines going to look like and how are we going to structure their sort of workflow. We really took on looking at all of our communications and all of our materials and how do we want to change that. So, we did this sort of internal processes and planning that have served us well. And I think when things do open up, we really will be able to come out strong. Wow, that's just amazing. And so, what does the future hold for American Friends of Tel Aviv University or for fundraising for universities in general? Which is the future hold, the future holds, I think no one more than me wants to get back to in-person meetings because for me, this is a relationship business. And that's why I love what I do. That's why I love getting up every morning and coming to work, because I love having these meaningful conversations. And I'm fortunate that sort of where I am in my career, the conversations are really with people who are, for the most part, philanthropically inclined and certainly have the means. So, it's an exciting, it's an interesting, it's always a meaningful conversation. So, I'm hopeful we get back to that. I think in terms of the near term, it looks a lot like trying to simulate or give people a similar feeling to being in someone's living room and hearing from a cutting edge researcher or someone who's doing cutting edge innovation, trying to use the technology that we have to make it more interactive. And after the pandemic hit and we all went into lockdown, we began doing weekly webinars, which then in the last couple months became every other week. But I think people have gotten Zoom fatigue, and people want to connect. And so, I think ways that we can connect people in smaller groups or more around more specific interests, I think that's exciting. 100%. I think that it's very exciting and I'm very hopeful that it goes back to reality as soon as possible. Jennifer, thank you for taking time to do this. Before we finish, I need three words that you would use to describe yourself. It's very tough to put oneself down to three words. Very difficult. I would say my three words in alphabetical order because I'm not sure I would have to think longer if I have to organize them otherwise are caring, hard-working and positive. It sounds like those are three things that you definitely need as you're going about the mission that you're doing. And I think that it's inspiring for me, looking at your background, going all the way from investment banking and those financial institutions and making your way towards philanthropy and really making an impact. And I haven't really even thought of that, about a dollar invested in in a place like Tel Aviv University versus a dollar spent in many other places. It's a different impact. It's not to say that it's better or worse, but it's a different impact. And it sounds very, very exciting and that you are making a very positive impact. So, thank you very much. And stay safe and stay healthy. Thank you. You too.
