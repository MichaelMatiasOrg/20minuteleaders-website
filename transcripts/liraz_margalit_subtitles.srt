1
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,920
Liraz Margalit, thank you so much

2
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
for joining me on my show.

3
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,040
How are you?

4
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,400
I'm very well. Thank you.

5
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400
How are you?

6
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,240
Fantastic.

7
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,760
I'm especially good now

8
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,160
because I'm very excited for this talk.

9
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,960
Because I'm going to learn

10
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,000
over these next 20 minutes

11
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,360
as much as I can

12
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,000
about behavioral economics.

13
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,440
Especially in building products

14
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,200
for customers in the digital age.

15
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,440
I have a true passion

16
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,560
for behavioral economics.

17
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,640
I got to spend some few months

18
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,200
very close with Dan Ariely

19
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,240
at Irrational Labs.

20
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,360
So, I'm excited to learn

21
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,760
about your experiences and your teaching.

22
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,320
You're also a university lecturer

23
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,680
at the IDC for many years.

24
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,240
And you're a strategic advisor

25
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,720
to many companies.

26
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,360
So, Liraz, give me the overview.

27
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,120
Who are you?

28
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,840
And why behavioral economics?

29
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,280
Okay. Great.

30
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,320
So, as you mentioned,

31
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,640
my name is Liraz Margalit.

32
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,720
I have PhD in psychology.

33
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,840
I'm specialized

34
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,880
in decision making processes,

35
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,280
cognition, behavioral economics.

36
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,440
And over the past few years,

37
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,240
I've been utilizing models

38
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,960
from cognitive psychology,

39
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,080
behavioral economics,

40
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,400
and neural psychology

41
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,080
to better understand how customers behave

42
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,640
in the digital world.

43
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,960
And what I truly passionate about

44
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,920
is the differences between

45
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,280
the online world and the offline world.

46
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,400
And I think that sometimes

47
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,520
we are not aware,

48
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,160
but we behave completely different

49
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,960
online and offline.

50
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,000
Right?

51
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,480
Yeah. And I'm really excited to learn

52
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,640
the influences of the technology

53
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,920
on our behavior,

54
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,920
our emotions and our feelings.

55
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,360
So, let's start from the basics.

56
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,800
Let's start from the foundation,

57
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,880
behavioral economics.

58
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,760
What is the study of behavioral economics?

59
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,400
Okay. So, actually today

60
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,640
we are talking about behavioral design.

61
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,400
But let's start with behavioral economics.

62
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,920
And we started off with an assumption.

63
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,360
Actually, it's a very logical assumption.

64
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,760
And the assumption is that

65
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,440
we are rational human being.

66
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,600
That we have rational decision

67
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,560
and moreover, that we are in control

68
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,920
of our decisions offline and online.

69
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
And the thing is that

70
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,560
we have a defense mechanism.

71
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,640
Meaning that, we really like to think

72
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,400
that our decisions, our behavior

73
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,320
are rational.

74
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,800
And the thing is that we are not begin

75
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,360
to imagine the effect of cognitive biases,

76
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,360
of environmental cues, of our emotions

77
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,960
on the way we make decisions.

78
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,640
And, you know what, Michael?

79
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,000
When we are talking

80
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,240
about the online arena,

81
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,200
this problem is getting much bigger.

82
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,520
Wait, Liraz, before we get to the online.

83
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,600
Give me some examples.

84
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,240
What happens in my day to day life,

85
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,000
whether it's when I go buy wine

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,640
at the store,

87
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,240
or when I choose a subscription

88
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,680
for The Economist paper or digital,

89
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,920
give me some examples

90
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,320
of where do I see irrationality?

91
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:16,880
And I'm telling you,

92
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,320
I am the most irrational person

93
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,840
you'll ever meet.

94
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,960
You can ask my girlfriend.

95
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,240
She'll testify for this.

96
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,000
But I want you to convince

97
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,040
everybody else listening

98
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,960
that we are all irrational.

99
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,600
So, let me give you two example.

100
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,560
Two quick example.

101
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,760
So, I work with a company named Allianz.

102
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,840
It is an insurance company.

103
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,440
Yes.

104
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,440
And you know that they have their policy.

105
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,760
And they wanted to ask people,

106
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,160
they usually, on a regular basis,

107
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,840
ask people declaration of their health.

108
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,520
And one of these question is,

109
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,200
do you smoke.

110
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,600
And the thing is that most people,

111
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,560
interestingly, say that,

112
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,040
they are not smoking.

113
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,000
And of course, they're lying.

114
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,360
So, we wanted to understand

115
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,200
how we can make sure

116
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,040
that people are saying the truth.

117
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,720
Because it caused a lot of money

118
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,920
to the company.

119
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,520
So, I suggested

120
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,160
to frame the question differently.

121
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,240
So, instead of asking people,

122
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,520
do you smoke,

123
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,200
I suggested asking,

124
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,800
when was the last time you smoke.

125
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,080
Right.

126
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,200
What is the difference?

127
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,800
Why are those two questions

128
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,720
ridiculously different?

129
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,000
So, the thing is that if I ask you,

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,720
when's the last time you smoke,

131
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,400
that means that I acknowledge the fact

132
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,120
that you smoke.

133
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,000
And that's fine and that's okay.

134
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,640
And now you belong to a group of smokers.

135
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,000
So, that makes it okay.

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,600
And now, if I know that,

137
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,040
and if I make you realize

138
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,920
that I know you're smoking,

139
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,120
it's very hard lying about it.

140
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,640
So, that's the whole thing.

141
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,200
That's the whole idea

142
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,800
of behavioral economics.

143
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,800
It's about framing things differently.

144
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,160
So, we have the famous question of

145
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,360
[--]

146
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,560
So, let's say that you decided

147
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,640
to go to a movie.

148
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,520
And now, you decided

149
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,600
to buy the ticket, let's say online.

150
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,520
And you come to the movie,

151
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,640
you come to the theater.

152
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,760
And then you realize

153
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,200
that you lost your ticket.

154
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,880
What are you going to do.

155
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,480
Now, bear with me.

156
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,120
I'm going to ask this question

157
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,240
differently.

158
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,040
The same question, but differently.

159
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,280
Okay. So, let's say that you decided

160
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,680
to see a movie.

161
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,120
And this time you decided

162
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,280
that you are not going to buy

163
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
the ticket online.

164
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,160
So, you decided to go to the theater

165
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,640
and buy the tickets there.

166
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,160
So, you arrived to the theater

167
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,040
and then you opened your wallet.

168
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,520
You open up your wallet and you found out

169
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,000
that you are missing

170
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,760
a 50 dollar, or 20 dollar.

171
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,360
And then you ask yourself,

172
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,920
"Okay. What am I going to do now?"

173
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,360
"Am I going to buy another ticket?"

174
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,240
So, guess what?

175
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,560
In the first scenario, people usually,

176
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,520
they are not going to buy another ticket.

177
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,240
But in the second scenario,

178
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,040
they are going to buy another ticket.

179
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,960
And why is that?

180
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,920
So, why don't they. Yeah.

181
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Because in the first scenario,

182
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,280
they feel like they spent,

183
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,160
like if ticket cost $20,

184
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,240
they feel like they spent $40

185
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,760
on one ticket.

186
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,920
But interestingly, in the second scenario

187
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,520
they don't correlate the money.

188
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,530
They don't group them together.

189
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,680
Exactly. In mentally.

190
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,000
Meaning, so, they don't associate

191
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,880
the money that lost

192
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,760
and the ticket to the theater

193
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,240
and then it's fine to buy another ticket.

194
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,920
But if we think about it,

195
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,680
this is not a rational behavior.

196
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,200
Because we are talking about

197
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,640
the same amount of money.

198
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,440
Yeah, exactly.

199
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,640
And so, Liraz, just like these examples,

200
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,080
there are hundreds more out there

201
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,640
that from every part of our lives.

202
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,560
One of the first examples

203
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,480
that I was introduced to

204
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,880
was this notion of buying a wine bottle

205
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
at the supermarket

206
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,500
and how we often tend to go and buy

207
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,520
the median price for a bottle of wine.

208
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,360
And if they add

209
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,800
an additional bottle of wine at the end

210
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,680
that is more expensive,

211
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,720
then we opt up to go buy there.

212
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,160
Right.

213
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,200
Think I might have lost you.

214
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,080
No. I'm here.

215
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,040
Right. So, I was giving my own example

216
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,200
of going to the wine store

217
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,640
and understanding that human behavior

218
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,760
tends to go to purchase

219
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,680
the median dollar amount

220
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,520
for a bottle of wine.

221
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,280
But then, if marketers are smart about it

222
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,320
and realize this,

223
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,000
they can just add

224
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,760
an extra expensive bottle of wine

225
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,200
at the end, and all of a sudden,

226
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,400
most customers shift

227
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,080
to the little bit more expensive option.

228
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,000
But Liraz, I want us now

229
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,720
stir a little bit away from these

230
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,240
general behavioral economics examples

231
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,680
and talk a little bit more broadly

232
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,360
about your work in the digital age.

233
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,360
So, a lot of these are tangible,

234
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,000
physical examples in our daily lives.

235
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,520
But what is different as we progress

236
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,720
into the 21st century in terms of

237
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,760
behavioral economics in online?

238
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,040
So, the actual difference

239
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,760
is how we can use it

240
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,680
in a practical manner.

241
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,160
And let me give you an example

242
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,840
that concern our everyday lives.

243
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,920
And we're talking about the same example.

244
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,400
So now in your example and in my example,

245
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,040
we actually talked about

246
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,600
the ethical framing.

247
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,000
How we frame our decision.

248
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
So, let's just continue

249
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,960
with what you are just about to say.

250
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,040
Okay. Great.

251
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,240
So, the differences

252
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,480
when we're talking about our environment,

253
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,960
the technology environment, is that

254
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,360
we are talking about the same effect

255
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,800
of behavioral economics

256
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,600
but in a practical manner.

257
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,920
And today, we know that

258
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,040
so many tech companies

259
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,200
actually adopted those principles

260
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,960
of behavioral economics.

261
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,480
But I have to say that sometimes

262
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,920
it's not in a very ethical way.

263
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,160
Let me give you two examples.

264
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,600
Please.

265
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,440
So, the first example is that

266
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,960
to use the same principle

267
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,040
that we were discussing right now,

268
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,280
and this principle is called framing,

269
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,760
or relative thinking, or anchoring,

270
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,640
you can name it different ways.

271
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,560
But the idea is that

272
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,960
the way we frame the decision,

273
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,800
the way we frame the digital environment,

274
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,560
actually is going to change our behavior.

275
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,720
And the thing is that,

276
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,480
in the digital, it's very very easy

277
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,960
to change the digital environment.

278
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,720
And let's say that you get up

279
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,320
in the morning,

280
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,240
and you know that most people today,

281
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,640
when they get up in the morning,

282
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,880
the first thing that they are going to do

283
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,750
is to check upt their smartphone

284
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,160
To check up if they have new notification.

285
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,320
And let me tell you something,

286
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,520
sometimes they do it

287
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,200
even in the middle of the night.

288
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,360
So that, even maybe

289
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,200
they have such an important notification

290
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,760
that they have to take.

291
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,960
So now, let me give you an imagine.

292
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,800
And what I'm talking about now,

293
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,880
I like to call it

294
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,480
the power of the default.

295
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,480
What is the default?

296
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,480
The default is that

297
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,920
you open up your smartphone

298
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,200
and you see all those notification.

299
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,840
But imagine this.

300
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,640
Imagine that you get up in the morning

301
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,720
and you see your smartphone,

302
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,480
your nice smartphone said,

303
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
"Good morning, Michael."

304
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,720
"Have a nice day."

305
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,560
And maybe he's going to give you

306
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,400
a flower or something.

307
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,000
So, these are two different ways

308
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,120
where we can frame

309
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
your good morning environment.

310
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,000
The reason that we choose to give you

311
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,760
those notification,

312
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,680
it's actually a message.

313
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,960
And these messages look all you missed

314
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,360
when you were sleeping.

315
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,040
And that means don't sleep.

316
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,200
If you're going to sleep,

317
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,360
you are going to miss so many things.

318
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,000
So, don't sleep.

319
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,840
And of course, we don't consider this.

320
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,240
Why?

321
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,720
Because we are so used to it.

322
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,240
Because behavioral design is embedded

323
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,240
in a transparent way in our everyday life.

324
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,560
So, we didn't even give it the thought

325
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,900
that things could be different, right?

326
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:49,440
Or let's say, I would say,

327
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,720
the big influencer of behavioral economics

328
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,920
or manipulator, booking.com.

329
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,880
So, booking.com has this way of,

330
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,880
let's say that

331
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,080
you are looking up for a hotel.

332
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,630
And one room left.

333
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,100
Exactly.

334
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,930
One room left and actually,

335
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,400
[--]

336
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,360
So, let's say, so many people

337
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:22,200
are looking at this specific room

338
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,200
when you are looking at this room.

339
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,500
So, these are two examples

340
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,850
how we can manipulate people's feelings,

341
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,900
people's decision,

342
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,100
And we didn't even start

343
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,770
on those special days.

344
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,100
Like selling days.

345
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,830
Like we have cyber mondays,

346
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,520
Or like fridays, when everything you buy

347
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,150
is supposed to be on sale.

348
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,250
And people buy things

349
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,550
that they don't need.

350
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,200
And [--]

351
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,700
And more than 40% of items

352
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,000
that are bought in those selling days

353
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,150
are being thrown away after this.

354
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:07,450
But we think that we actually won.

355
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,520
That we actually have a good deal.

356
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,150
That's because they are manipulated

357
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,900
to think that.

358
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,640
So, all of that is incredibly fascinating.

359
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,240
And all these examples

360
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,840
of behavioral economics.

361
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,280
But you're strategic adviser

362
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,520
to quite a few companies.

363
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,920
And what I'm extremely curious about

364
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,040
is how practically do you go and

365
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,080
and do you incorporate

366
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,280
this academic research

367
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,520
of behavioral economics

368
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,920
into everyday startups?

369
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,960
Because when I look at myself

370
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,700
as a young entrepreneur,

371
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,120
I'm going to create my own startup.

372
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,160
Now, I'm very passionate

373
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,080
about behavioral economics.

374
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,200
So, maybe, I'll have a little bit

375
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,400
more experience and knowledge

376
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,800
than the average person

377
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,560
starting a company.

378
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,480
But what are the ways

379
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,040
in which you come

380
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,200
and help these companies,

381
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,680
like you mentioned, with Allianz?

382
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,560
And what can founders and entrepreneurs do

383
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,320
to become better engaged

384
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,800
with this content?

385
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,200
Okay. Great question.

386
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,760
So, what I like to do with startups

387
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,240
is habit forming.

388
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,280
And by habit forming, we mean

389
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,040
how to take a product

390
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,600
and form a habit out of it.

391
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,080
Because the thing about habits

392
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,560
is really interesting.

393
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,760
Because when there is an initiate behavior

394
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,200
and when there is the habit,

395
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,120
we are talking about

396
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,760
two different brain areas.

397
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,600
Because habit is unconscious.

398
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,840
And that means

399
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,320
that you don't need to think

400
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,640
about what you are doing.

401
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,680
So, let's say you are going on Facebook.

402
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,560
Sometimes we don't even consider this.

403
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,480
This is not where

404
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,720
we're talking about rationality.

405
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,920
So, when we are talking about habit,

406
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,840
this is not irrational action.

407
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,040
And this is why we are eager

408
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,480
to turn every behavior,

409
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,400
every actually a set of behaviors

410
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,800
into a habit.

411
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,440
So, let's say that you have a new app.

412
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,240
Why are habit so strong, by the way?

413
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,680
Why are habits so strong?

414
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,160
Okay. So, the thing is that,

415
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,480
our brain will try to take every action

416
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,040
and turn it into a habit.

417
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,680
Because habit does not require

418
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,080
cognitive resources,

419
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,600
mental resources from our brain.

420
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,560
So, when we lock out our door,

421
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,960
when we brush our teeth in the morning,

422
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,840
we don't think about it.

423
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,240
And if you think about it,

424
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,520
you can lock your door

425
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,240
and then you can think about,

426
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,920
like your presentation

427
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,120
that you need to present today

428
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,880
to your boss.

429
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,800
And you could think about

430
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,400
who is going to pick up the kids

431
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,880
from the kindergarten.

432
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,280
So, your brain is free

433
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,960
to think about other tasks.

434
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,880
And that is why habits are so important.

435
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,840
The thing is that,

436
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,080
when companies come to me,

437
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,800
they think that

438
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,960
they can turn every behavior

439
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,440
into a habit.

440
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,200
And that is not correct.

441
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,600
Because there are behaviors

442
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
that you cannot turn into a habit.

443
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,200
And when we're talking about habits,

444
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,760
we have the habit look.

445
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,160
Meaning that we need to have a trigger

446
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,600
to the behavior.

447
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,400
We need to have the routine

448
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,320
and we need to have the reward.

449
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,720
And your reward is extremely important

450
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,880
because if the reward is powerful,

451
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,840
then we will remember it.

452
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,320
And then we want to actually repeat

453
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,400
the behavior again.

454
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,040
And it will repeat the behavior

455
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,040
several times.

456
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,680
And it's not 21 days

457
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,200
like people like to say.

458
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,640
It depends on the actual behavior.

459
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,080
Then your product will become

460
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,440
a part of the customer's routine.

461
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,240
And this is the holy grail.

462
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,160
So, when you join a startup as an adviser,

463
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,920
do you come in just one time?

464
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,520
You just say,

465
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,800
"Oh, okay, you're trying to do XYZ."

466
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,800
"Here is the habit."

467
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,560
"Here is how you do it."

468
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,840
Or is it a more thorough process

469
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,440
along the way?

470
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,400
No, because we have many habits.

471
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,720
Every click is a habit.

472
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,280
So, we need to think about

473
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,800
the specific rewards.

474
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,320
But there is another thing

475
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,440
that we need to do these days.

476
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,320
And we are talking about personalization.

477
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,840
And now we are in the world

478
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,080
of personalization.

479
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,120
And the thing about personalization

480
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,680
that for so many years,

481
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,680
we are trying to reach that point,

482
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,320
that level.

483
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,160
But I think I really believe that

484
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,080
on the last two years

485
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,640
we were able to have some progress

486
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,600
in personalization.

487
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,920
And by personalization,

488
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,200
I mean that when you walk,

489
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,560
or when you land on a website or app,

490
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,560
you will have a different experience

491
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,080
compared to me.

492
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
And that means that

493
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,120
we need to get to know our user.

494
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,360
And that doesn't mean demographic.

495
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,640
I'm not talking about demographics at all.

496
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,520
I'm talking about personality.

497
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,120
And I'm talking about

498
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,640
decision making style.

499
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,600
So, today I can take your

500
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,320
Facebook profile, for example,

501
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,960
and I can know who you are

502
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,920
only based on your Facebook,

503
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,840
your Twitter, your LinkedIn.

504
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,480
So, actually, I don't need

505
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,400
so much information from you.

506
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,800
And even if you think about

507
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,240
the actual behavior, the actual traces

508
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,480
that we live in the online world,

509
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,040
we can learn so much from those traces.

510
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,840
So, let's say that you fill in a form.

511
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,840
So, I can tell using behavioral analytics,

512
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,320
I can tell how you type.

513
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,880
How fast, how slow you type.

514
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,960
So, if you are lying,

515
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,600
I know that you will type slower,

516
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
for example.

517
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,400
And I know if you decided

518
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,560
to skip on a field

519
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,000
and then come back to it.

520
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,600
And that means that I want to see

521
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
what you are doing

522
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,320
and why you actually behave this way.

523
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,640
And sometimes,

524
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,760
I actually plant manipulation.

525
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,680
And let's say that there is a button

526
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,400
or a click that doesn't work.

527
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,760
I like to see how people

528
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,160
actually click on this button.

529
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,840
Meaning that are they eagerly click

530
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,360
one after time or are they passionate.

531
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,520
And that means a lot about their behavior.

532
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,680
About who they are.

533
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,760
Wow. Liraz, this is fascinating,

534
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,720
I can ask you 100 more questions

535
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,680
about this, but unfortunately,

536
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,400
I called my show 20 minute leader,

537
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,880
so, I have to uphold to that.

538
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,960
But I want to thank you again

539
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,760
for being so generous with your time.

540
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,440
It's been such a pleasure and an honor.

541
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,480
And I'd love to continue learning more

542
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,160
from your work.

543
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,560
And hopefully talk to you

544
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,680
when I have my own startup.

545
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,440
But before we leave, I need three words

546
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,240
that you would use to describe yourself.

547
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,640
Okay. Great.

548
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,360
I think that the three words

549
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,680
that mostly describe me is

550
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,400
it's all about passion. Passionate.

551
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,240
Passionate. It's all about passion.

552
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,480
Culminating in passionate.

553
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,080
I think that definitely exudes

554
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,840
through this conversation.

555
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,680
Liraz, thank you very much.

556
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,280
Toda raba.

557
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,960
This is so wonderful.

558
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,520
And I look forward to chatting again.

559
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,120
Great.

560
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,480
Take care.

561
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,600
Than you for inviting me. Bye bye.

562
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,240
Okay. Liraz, before we leave,

563
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,400
three words that you would use

564
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,850
to describe yourself.

565
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:04,120
Great. So, the three words are

566
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,520
it's all about passion.

567
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,000
It's all about passion.

568
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,880
Again, it completely exudes

569
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,240
through the screen.

570
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,520
I love the wok that you're doing.

571
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,680
I love behavioral economics.

572
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,680
And I think it's just so fascinating

573
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,480
to think about the rationality

574
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,440
and irrationality

575
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,720
of human decision making.

576
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,600
And the fact that you're taking this

577
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,320
into a deep dive into the digital world

578
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,240
and thinking critically

579
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,160
about how we do things.

580
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
I think it's remarkable.

581
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,680
So, thank you very very much.

582
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,640
And I look forward to remaining in touch.

583
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,640
Thank you so much for inviting me.

584
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,880
Bye bye.
