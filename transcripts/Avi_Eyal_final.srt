1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,560
For farmers to really be successful

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,680
and to really build with thought

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,040
and build something

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,720
which will last a long time,

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,960
my view is that farmers should

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,520
take the time, get to a decision

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,440
what they want to build,

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,960
begin building it,

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,480
really get down the line

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,000
of understanding,

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,920
really have it well documented

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,960
of what they want to build,

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:35,680
how they want to build it.

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,960
Avi Eyal,

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,760
thank you for joining me

16
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,640
on 20 Minute Leaders.

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,960
Welcome.

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,320
Thank you very much for having me.

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,920
I am honored to have you here.

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,920
Such a pleasure.

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,080
Avi, I can't wait to talk to you

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,120
about your journey all the way

23
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,360
from South Africa

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,280
with startups all the way

25
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,400
to venture capital.

26
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,680
I'm blown away

27
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,880
by even just saying this,

28
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,400
entrée Capital with over

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,600
90 portfolio companies.

30
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,320
23 exits, you told me.

31
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,880
But that's putting aside

32
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,760
the eight fantastic ventures

33
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,600
that you've either exited

34
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,880
or been successful with yourself.

35
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,760
Avi, what gives?

36
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,600
How do you even go

37
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,000
to having such an incredible trajectory?

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,040
I have to get into the mindset

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,440
of what you went through in your life.

40
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,240
It's just incredible.

41
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,120
So, as a background,

42
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,920
and it's not such a great trajectory,

43
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,880
I think many people

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,080
have much greater.

45
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,000
But I was born in Israel

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,160
to a very average Israeli family.

47
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,040
My father was in the colonel

48
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,800
in the Air Force,

49
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,240
I used to see him once a week.

50
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,600
And at some stage,

51
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,960
my mother had enough of it.

52
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,520
And at the age of six,

53
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,320
my father took up the role

54
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,120
as an engineer in South Africa

55
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,320
and moved us to South Africa.

56
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,080
And I grew up in South Africa.

57
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,960
In grade one, I met

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,160
what became a great friend

59
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,360
and also a business partner of mine,

60
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,480
Martin, and I did my schooling

61
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,400
in South Africa.

62
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,440
Studied engineering

63
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,120
at the University of Natal.

64
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,680
Studied computer engineering

65
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,560
and software engineering,

66
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,520
electrical engineering.

67
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,320
And to put myself through university,

68
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,800
I really didn't know what I was doing.

69
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,320
So, I started a company

70
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,640
writing software to people.

71
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,840
It was the age of ARCNET and Ethernet

72
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,080
starting up and,

73
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,200
and people were writing database's

74
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,640
in dBase and [--] seven.

75
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,360
And I started writing software

76
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,520
for companies

77
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,440
and someone asked me,

78
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,000
"What do you need

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
to give me an invoice?

80
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,720
What are you going to call

81
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,680
this company of yours?"

82
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,080
So, I didn't have anything better to do

83
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,560
in an age of 18.

84
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,920
I called the great programming solutions

85
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,209
GPX, and that's how the company started.

86
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,800
We became known as Insight Technologies.

87
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,800
By the time I finished university,

88
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,480
we had 50 or 60 employees.

89
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,200
Two years later, we merged into an IPO

90
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,920
in South Africa and then in London.

91
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,760
And really from not knowing any better,

92
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,880
we had a fairly good success

93
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,760
in this business.

94
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,600
I eventually left the business

95
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,640
and had another two startups

96
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,200
that I wanted to try out.

97
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,480
One we sold to

98
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,920
Walmart subsidiary in South Africa,

99
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,120
and the second became

100
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,160
a pretty big property business,

101
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,880
which ended I up being

102
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,280
a shareholder of for 15 years.

103
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,560
But what I realized was that

104
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,800
I needed to leave South Africa

105
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,600
if I wanted to make it big, you know.

106
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,000
Like the actors go to Hollywood

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,120
to try and make a big world.

108
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,640
You know, entrepreneurs want

109
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,480
to make a big, we go to the US.

110
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,600
It seems that a couple of other people

111
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,120
were doing the same kind of thing.

112
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,560
Probably much more successful than me,

113
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,160
Elon Musk, Roelof Botha at Sequoia,

114
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,720
seems like they had the same idea.

115
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,560
So, I landed in the US

116
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,400
and I was fortunate enough to,

117
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,360
over the next six years,

118
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,560
be involved in a number of startups

119
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,200
which were sold eventually

120
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,240
to two public companies.

121
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,120
One to private equity business,

122
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,440
and one I sold back to management,

123
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,120
where I learnt a valuable lesson

124
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,200
that if things don't look right

125
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
and don't feel right,

126
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,640
and it's much better to exit gracefully.

127
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,520
Get your money back and move on.

128
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,800
And then from there,

129
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,520
I went through a couple of phases.

130
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,360
I went back to South Africa,

131
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,080
got married,

132
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,000
started one more startup,

133
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,120
exited it to a public company in India

134
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,280
and my partner, Martin and I,

135
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,680
who were involved

136
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,200
in the startup as well,

137
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,280
we decided that we'd

138
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,080
start investing in companies.

139
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,720
We had reached

140
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,680
the ripe old age of 40

141
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,280
and everyone was younger,

142
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,960
brighter, faster, stronger.

143
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,640
So, we thought that, you know,

144
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,880
we have a bit of experience

145
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,600
and you know, if we can leverage

146
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,920
our founder experience

147
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,040
to other industries, other startups,

148
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,040
we could leverage that.

149
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,560
And that was the birth of Entrée Capital.

150
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,000
Wow.

151
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Avi, I have to focus a little bit

152
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,840
about this incredible

153
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,320
entrepreneurial experience.

154
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,800
Walk me through some of these

155
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,720
of the key similarities between

156
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,320
the different ventures that you formed.

157
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,080
I think one of the most

158
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,160
fascinating things that I'm gaining

159
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,240
from hearing these incredible stories

160
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,760
is really piecing together some insights

161
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,640
when you look back.

162
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,240
So, if you look back, for example,

163
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,200
in the first venture

164
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,720
that you had during college,

165
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,440
what are some key either mistakes

166
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,160
or incredible insights that you

167
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,200
have gained looking back at it

168
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,040
that you took with you

169
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,680
throughout the rest of your journey?

170
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,600
Sure. Which mistakes didn't I make?

171
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,280
I kind of think

172
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,600
that we were lucky and successful

173
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,200
despite everything we did.

174
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,280
I love it.

175
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,400
The one thing is

176
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,160
we got involved, I always started

177
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,600
in businesses that were moonshots

178
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,480
or at the forefront

179
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,400
of what they were doing.

180
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,400
So, we kind of picked the trend of,

181
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,120
you know, applications,

182
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,920
databases on PCs, moved to Windows

183
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,320
from the old Novell environment,

184
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,200
you know, when networking became

185
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,160
far more accessible

186
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,200
and easier to manage.

187
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,680
So, we leveraged those things

188
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,160
and that was kind of a trend

189
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,360
that followed on when, my second venture

190
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,400
in South Africa was ICOM,

191
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,080
which did which basically took

192
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,920
EDI, which was really old

193
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,240
and really erected an XML

194
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,800
and created XML schemes.

195
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,760
This is a 1995 or so.

196
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,560
Again, what's at the forefront

197
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,840
of what was happening in those days

198
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,000
and sending those messages

199
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,520
across pharmaceutical companies

200
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,840
and big distributors over the Internet

201
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,360
to, in the states where

202
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,200
we had a business,

203
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,920
one of the businesses

204
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,880
was called Maestro Commerce,

205
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,240
where it was really Shopify in 1999.

206
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,360
But you'll appreciate that there wasn't,

207
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,520
there wasn't the ability

208
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,040
to build things at scale in the cloud,

209
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,880
in that first Internet 1.0 operation.

210
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,320
But having said that,

211
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,960
we did very well with it

212
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,040
to [--] DNS

213
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,160
which I was involved in a company

214
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,480
that was taking DNS

215
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,400
and putting it in a software stack

216
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
for the first time

217
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,160
and taking it off routers,

218
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,280
Cisco routers and things like that.

219
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,760
Fast forward 15 years later,

220
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,720
I back to business school

221
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,480
NS1 out of New York,

222
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,640
which is kind of

223
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,720
the new generation of DNS.

224
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,480
And NS1 today is probably

225
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,760
the leading company around the world

226
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,880
for application load balancing,

227
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,640
content distribution, DNS,

228
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,640
security and things like that.

229
00:09:07,641 --> 00:09:09,520
And so, a lot of the things

230
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,800
repeat on themselves

231
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,880
in new guises.

232
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,320
Mistakes we made there

233
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,840
kind of not understanding

234
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,600
how to hire the right people,

235
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,200
and not understanding

236
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,880
how to scale business,

237
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,880
being very much

238
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,000
probably a fair amount of arrogance

239
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,080
and kind of building things

240
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,000
around yourself

241
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,520
rather than building things

242
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,840
around teams and releasing.

243
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,720
You know,

244
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,360
typical mistakes that people make

245
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,840
when they don't have

246
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,960
the benefit of expertise

247
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,280
in an ecosystem to use.

248
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,600
And it was one of the biggest

249
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,880
valuable lessons I learned

250
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,960
moving to the states, and that

251
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,080
in South Africa, you were working

252
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,120
as an island, you know.

253
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,000
There wasn't an ecosystem to teach you

254
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,960
how to build great tech companies.

255
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,760
And that's the one thing

256
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,720
that you have to give to Israel,

257
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,160
to London now,

258
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,400
to Boston, New York, San Francisco.

259
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,480
These places have developed

260
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,600
unbelievable ecosystems that,

261
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,480
and certainly in the second iteration

262
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,680
post 2008, of information sharing

263
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,400
and families helping each other.

264
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,040
Jus the plethora of information

265
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,680
that's out there,

266
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,160
whether it's a blog post,

267
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,920
you know, 20 Minute Leadership, etc.,

268
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,360
for people to share information

269
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,960
and not worry about sharing

270
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,240
the information in a way

271
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,000
that it lifts up the entire industry

272
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,800
and makes everyone successful.

273
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,600
100%.

274
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,360
Avi, so, obviously now,

275
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,840
aside from the eight ventures

276
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,600
that you've had,

277
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
which are incredible,

278
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,120
you've now also invested

279
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,520
in over 90 portfolio companies.

280
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,480
You've seen a, you know over

281
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,640
a quarter of them exit already.

282
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,800
I have to gauge now,

283
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,840
for young entrepreneurs,

284
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,800
as an entrepreneur myself

285
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,240
and for other young entrepreneurs

286
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,200
starting on their journey,

287
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,480
what are some,

288
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,280
you mentioned about

289
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,400
the power of the ecosystem

290
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,880
and power of the expertise.

291
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,960
So, here's an opportunity for me to talk

292
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,480
to one of the world experts

293
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,880
on startup formation and venture

294
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,520
and venture scaling.

295
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,800
What are some key things

296
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,120
that I should keep in mind

297
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,560
as I go about my venture

298
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,000
or my friends who keep in mind

299
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,280
as they go about theirs

300
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,200
from the early days,

301
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,800
all the way to hiring properly

302
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,560
and scaling it a little bit?

303
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,720
I know it's an incredible

304
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,280
amount to cover,

305
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,240
but the key nuggets

306
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,080
or the key things

307
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,600
that you just keep repeating themselves.

308
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,840
Yes. So, I'm not really an expert. It's,

309
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,480
you know, I offer advice,

310
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,280
and sometimes the advice is right.

311
00:11:40,281 --> 00:11:42,400
but I keep telling people

312
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:48,960
that past performance is no indicator

313
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,240
of future returns.

314
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:58,400
I think that too many founders have,

315
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,240
especially in this last year or two,

316
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,040
too many founders

317
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,160
leverage their own brand to go out

318
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,000
and raise incredible amounts of money

319
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,400
because it's easy.

320
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,160
And my thought on it is that

321
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,480
for founders to really be successful

322
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,600
and to really build with thought

323
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,960
and build something

324
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,640
which will last a long time.

325
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,800
My view is that founders

326
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,040
should take their time,

327
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,400
get to a decision

328
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,360
what they want to build,

329
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,840
begin building it,

330
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,400
really get down the line

331
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,920
of understanding,

332
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,840
really have a well documented

333
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,880
on what they want to build,

334
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
how they want to build it.

335
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,640
Make decisions on

336
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,000
how they're going to scale,

337
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,120
what those things are going to look

338
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,320
before they raise them

339
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,440
copious amounts of money.

340
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,400
I think they should raise their pre-seed

341
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,880
or their seed around,

342
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,360
they should take time.

343
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
They should make sure

344
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,480
they have it right.

345
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,000
Because if you do things right

346
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,560
and if you get to this breakout situation

347
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,680
or moonshots trajectory,

348
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,480
you don't have time

349
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,360
to go back and do things all over.

350
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,960
You don't have time to go back

351
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,040
and correct the sins of the past.

352
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,760
So, my intention is not to be

353
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,560
so influenced by,

354
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,680
oh, I can now raise the seed round.

355
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,600
Six months later, I can raise the A,

356
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,720
and you know, triple the valuation

357
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,800
or quadruple the valuation.

358
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,840
If someone wants to give me

359
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,560
20 million now,

360
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,480
let's quickly take that.

361
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,840
I think it has to be

362
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,520
a bit of thought put into it.

363
00:13:46,521 --> 00:13:48,000
Just because money is there,

364
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,200
money is not the objective.

365
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,280
The objective is

366
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,240
how to build a big company,

367
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,920
a successful venture

368
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,320
that is meaningful to you

369
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,880
and to your stakeholders.

370
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,000
And many times the funding is the,

371
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,600
it is someone else's solution.

372
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,960
It's not the company's best interest.

373
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,320
So, my view is to take it slow,

374
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,680
repeat, build the flywheel,

375
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,600
test, retest and then grow.

376
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,160
And I think that it's a hard thing

377
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,480
to hold yourself back in this market

378
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,720
where money is so cheap.

379
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,720
But I think long term

380
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,840
is best served if you do that.

381
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,720
I think that one of the things

382
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,480
in your touching upon

383
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,360
which I've been very curious about myself

384
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,400
and I've been hearing a lot here,

385
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,000
is this idea of intentionality.

386
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,800
Not just being intentional about,

387
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,960
you know, your team and your product,

388
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,600
but also being intentional about

389
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,120
the growth of your company

390
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,320
and having some

391
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,000
sort of coherent rationality

392
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,760
behind the decisions you make.

393
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,440
And like you're mentioning,

394
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,800
you know, I'm seeing an environment

395
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,160
in which there is a lot of interest

396
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,040
from investors,

397
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,320
there's a lot of interest from advisors

398
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,880
and from people

399
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,440
to want to be part of different journeys,

400
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,680
especially in communities like,

401
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,960
let's say 8200 or Stanford,

402
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,720
but with so many

403
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,080
other communities as well.

404
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,240
And what I'm watching also

405
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,560
is almost like you mentioned,

406
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,840
a lack of intentionality

407
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,760
and a fight for raising

408
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,040
the most amount of capital

409
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
or for the biggest names

410
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,000
and the biggest brands.

411
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,040
But without thinking, perhaps,

412
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,880
too critically about

413
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,440
how is this going to help me reach

414
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,760
my next milestone

415
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,440
of making that moonshot impact

416
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,160
or some meaningful impact along the way.

417
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,480
And so, I'm definitely

418
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,080
taking that to heart.

419
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,760
But Avi, I have to ask,

420
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,480
perhaps, one of the most

421
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,680
difficult questions.

422
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,840
You've done so much.

423
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,560
You've had eight incredible ventures.

424
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,000
You have 90 portfolio companies

425
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,680
with 23 exits.

426
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,080
You've run SigmaLabs,

427
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,960
you are on the board member

428
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,560
of Monday.com from the beginning

429
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,560
with so many other companies,

430
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,280
why work more?

431
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,800
Why do you get up

432
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,120
still every day

433
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,920
and work so much

434
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,920
to continue finding more

435
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,120
amazing companies

436
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,920
and spend more time?

437
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,800
You've done it all. Like, seriously.

438
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:10,120
So, I would beg to differ.

439
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,240
My passion is growing businesses,

440
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,000
growing founders

441
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,280
and I live and breathe it.

442
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,560
I think a lot of people

443
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,800
have done far better.

444
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,960
And it's not a race,

445
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,760
not a comparison.

446
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,760
But if someone built

447
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,440
nine businesses themselves,

448
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,680
you know, if you take,

449
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,200
if you had to compare on Elon Musk,

450
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,720
he's done, you know,

451
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,960
two or three businesses,

452
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,120
got SpaceX, he's got Tesla,

453
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,960
and he's got a few other things.

454
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,880
But just between those two things,

455
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,600
he's done so much more

456
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,600
than I could ever hope to do.

457
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,960
But I suppose in my own way,

458
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,760
I love founders, I love building.

459
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,720
I enjoy the challenge.

460
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,240
I need to be challenged every day.

461
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:11,320
And for me, it's a combination of

462
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,752
I keep telling my founders, ABC.

463
00:17:13,753 --> 00:17:16,320
Always be closing, you know.

464
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,800
The challenge

465
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,320
that could you be missing out on something.

466
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:24,160
You know, maybe a bit of avariciousness,

467
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,840
but it's kind of

468
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,520
the need to learn every day.

469
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:33,640
I'm insatiably thirsty

470
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,120
for information and data and learning.

471
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,600
And also, to be fair,

472
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,099
it's not that I've built 90 or,

473
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,000
the founders have built 90 businesses.

474
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,760
I have partners

475
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,040
and employees who work with me

476
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,240
and the partnership has built

477
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,600
90 successes.

478
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,360
I maybe the front face

479
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,160
of the partnership

480
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,400
but everyone in our business

481
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,680
works really hard

482
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,800
and really does extraordinarily well.

483
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,600
And maybe I think

484
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,600
maybe the success has been

485
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,320
that insatiability

486
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,160
or that appetite to build

487
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,040
and not to miss out to

488
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,040
and to help and to grow,

489
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,400
I think has maybe rubbed it off

490
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,440
on the three or four key people

491
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,000
in our business

492
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,800
that write the checks.

493
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,760
Right. I have to say that even beyond

494
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,600
the incredible trajectory,

495
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,680
I'm even more inspired

496
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,080
by the humbleness that you portray here.

497
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,560
And obviously,

498
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,800
there are phenomenal people

499
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,920
that are working

500
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,720
on a lot of these endeavors.

501
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,200
But at the end of the day,

502
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,040
you mentioned that you didn't create

503
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,240
those 90 companies yourself,

504
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:47,880
but, you know,

505
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,480
finding those 90 companies

506
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,640
and then finding the right founders

507
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,120
and having that joint partnership

508
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,640
and providing value

509
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,920
that both sides are happy,

510
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,640
i think that's inspiring for me to say.

511
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,760
I see so many partnerships of friends,

512
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,000
either from the venture capital world

513
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,480
or founding partners

514
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,920
or advisors that provide less value

515
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,560
than anyone expected

516
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,840
or even have deteriorating effect.

517
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,000
And I think that finding

518
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,560
the right partners, to me,

519
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,920
it seems like you're growing

520
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,760
as the biggest part here,

521
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,800
in creating that venture.

522
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,200
And I think that anybody

523
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,480
who's been working with you

524
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,120
is incredibly lucky.

525
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,520
But Avi, a little bit

526
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,440
about finding the right founders.

527
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,520
Both founders and perhaps co-founders.

528
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,800
So, you've seen now, you know,

529
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,200
over 100 companies that you

530
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,000
have personally been involved with,

531
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,560
thousands more that you've observed.

532
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,440
What are some interesting insights

533
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,920
as to, either backing the right founders

534
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,080
or for a founder,

535
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,240
finding the right partners

536
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,040
to go on the journey with?

537
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,760
So, finding the right partners for us

538
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,280
is has been

539
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,720
a really challenging thing to do.

540
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,320
I think that we come from a background

541
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,400
where all of our partners

542
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,040
are quite technical.

543
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,600
They have very well-formed ideas

544
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,960
of what they believe in.

545
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,400
They, I would say

546
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,400
about my partners is that

547
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,240
they all have

548
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,520
the highest morals and ethics.

549
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,800
And to become a partner,

550
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,600
we have to work with someone

551
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,040
for a long time

552
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,920
and we have to know them

553
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
for a long time.

554
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,240
And it's kind of that's always

555
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,680
a challenge to get to the right place.

556
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,920
From a founders

557
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,680
and company perspective,

558
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,600
we kind of created a formula

559
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,960
of how we look at businesses

560
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,360
and how we look at founders

561
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,080
from a business perspective,

562
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,320
we call it the four Ts

563
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,000
where we created a formula

564
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,360
which is timing, tick,

565
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,764
TAM, and team.

566
00:21:01,765 --> 00:21:05,720
So, the founders individually are important,

567
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,000
but the founders no good

568
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,933
if they can't work on a team.

569
00:21:09,934 --> 00:21:10,400
Right.

570
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,600
And so, when I look at you as a founder,

571
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,040
I equally look at your co-founders.

572
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,400
And my test is,

573
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,160
if the founders, together,

574
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,640
can work on a team.

575
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,880
Right.

576
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,120
We don't like compromising on people

577
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,120
with that may not have

578
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,440
absolute integrity or,

579
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,400
you know, ethics or things like that.

580
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,560
I think all too often

581
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,920
people overlook certain challenges

582
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,320
that founders have

583
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,280
because they make it up

584
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,920
by, the idea is great

585
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,560
or something else.

586
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,680
But my view is that

587
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,120
you want to be in partners

588
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,720
with the people you go into business with.

589
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,120
And for us, we kind of

590
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,080
set our founders that

591
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,080
we are founders alongside them.

592
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,040
You know, we are entrepreneurs,

593
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,360
which is very different.

594
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,920
And because as entrepreneurs,

595
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,600
we can't see any of our businesses

596
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,760
in any other way

597
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,840
than from an entrepreneur's eyes.

598
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,680
And so, we want to be

599
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,080
an entrepreneur with you

600
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,720
rather than a financial investor in you.

601
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,800
Yes, we give you money

602
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,400
and yes, we expect to have great returns.

603
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,120
But we want to be

604
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,080
on the journey with you.

605
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,400
And so,

606
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,480
we find that kind of that alignment

607
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,440
works out very well.

608
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,480
And I think we've become very quick

609
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,480
at identifying if you are not fit.

610
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,160
And so, we can say no quite quickly.

611
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,200
But we also get to yes, very quickly.

612
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,480
I love that.

613
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,800
Avi, I have to thank you

614
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,040
for being so generous with your time.

615
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,600
And obviously,

616
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,880
I know how incredibly busy you are

617
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,200
and it's phenomenal having you here.

618
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,240
Thank you for the inspiration

619
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,560
and for the insights

620
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,200
and for making a positive impact.

621
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm just looking

622
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,280
at the different companies

623
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,920
that either you've build

624
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,160
or that you've helped become

625
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,840
a founding partner, as you're saying.

626
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,680
And I think it's just remarkable

627
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,160
and just that impact on the world

628
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,840
and that insatiable curiosity

629
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,040
that you talk about

630
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,160
is something that I identify

631
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,960
with very closely,

632
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,920
both with my family,

633
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,840
but also with myself.

634
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,360
And I think that I'm getting

635
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,720
the most inspiration

636
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,360
out of those two words

637
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,360
from this conversation.

638
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,320
But before we leave, I have to ask you

639
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,160
the most important

640
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,200
and difficult question,

641
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,280
which is three words

642
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,080
that you would use describe yourself.

643
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,920
Is this in terms of business

644
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,440
or in terms of personal?

645
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,520
I'm going to let you decide that.

646
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,440
Let's say if I ask one of your partners

647
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,920
or one of the founders

648
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,040
that you've backed,

649
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,960
who is Avi Eyal,

650
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,880
what are some words

651
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,520
that they would say about you?

652
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,120
Okay. Then I think they would tell you

653
00:23:53,800 --> 00:24:01,600
thoughtful, integrity and loyalty.

654
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,600
I love that.

655
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,080
And you forgot also

656
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,280
the two most important words,

657
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,600
insatiable, curious.

658
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,800
But I think that

659
00:24:08,801 --> 00:24:10,450
I'm going to have [--] in that.

660
00:24:10,451 --> 00:24:14,999
[--]

661
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,969
Avi, toda raba.

662
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,480
Thank you very, very much.

663
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,080
And I look forward to keeping in touch.

664
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,560
And it's just incredible.

665
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,320
Thank you.

666
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:22,680
Thank you.

667
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,080
I really appreciate you

668
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,920
having me on the show.
