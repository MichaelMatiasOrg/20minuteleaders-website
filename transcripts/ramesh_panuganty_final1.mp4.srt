1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,800
We will overcome that barrier.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,440
So, we would want to answer the questions

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,280
that the users are not asking

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,120
or they don't even know

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,315
how to ask the questions.

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,720
Ramesh Panuganty,

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,120
thank you so much for being on my show.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,600
How are you?

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,440
I'm good, Michael.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,400
Thanks for calling, yeah.

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,800
Thank you very much for being here.

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,960
It's a privilege to have you here.

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,800
A serial entrepreneur.

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,960
I think that you are the definition

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,280
of a serial entrepreneur

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,040
with three successful companies

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,840
behind you already.

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,440
All of them were acquired.

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,600
Some of them by companies

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,000
that I value very much.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,320
I think that until today,

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,680
I still use Splunk

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,120
on a pretty regular basis.

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,320
And now, you're on

25
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,600
to your fourth startup.

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,640
And I'm very proud

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,080
to be a part of the journey

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,360
as a part of J-Ventures,

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,440
one of the investors in the company.

30
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,920
And so, before we get to talk about

31
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,160
what this latest company is about.

32
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,760
Ramesh, I'd love for you to take me back

33
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,240
a little bit.

34
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,880
And what is it about entrepreneurship

35
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,760
and about building companies

36
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,120
that really gets you so excited?

37
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,720
Because now,

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,880
you're on to your fourth one.

39
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,320
So, instead of calling it

40
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,400
as an entrepreneurship,

41
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,840
let me just say that it was more about

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,880
being passionate than being about

43
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,600
trying to change the world

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
in like a smaller way.

45
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,080
And even before

46
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,800
I was starting my first company,

47
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,480
I thought there is actually

48
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,080
a big product market gap

49
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,600
in terms of what was happening

50
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,640
with the evolution of the cloud.

51
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,360
The Amazon Web Services

52
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,240
have just started.

53
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,360
There's probably less than 50 people

54
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,520
when I first interacted with them.

55
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,440
And I thought there is a big opportunity

56
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,760
in terms of,

57
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
say, what the cloud

58
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,160
could do for the world

59
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,360
and how people

60
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,400
can even get on to the cloud.

61
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,240
And coming from an

62
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,800
experience and operating systems.

63
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,760
I started my journey

64
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,720
in operating systems.

65
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,000
The first product I

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,400
tried to add and build

67
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,840
was SVR for UNIX operating system.

68
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,240
I spent about six years

69
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,480
on UNIX operating system

70
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,680
trying to add features,

71
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,520
make changes,

72
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,640
and then a new configuration things

73
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,400
like clustering.

74
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,640
So, I've come from the space,

75
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,880
what we've done always for about 12 years

76
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,640
or so across companies,

77
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,480
like Sun Microsystems StorageTek, etc.

78
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,360
And I thought there is an opportunity

79
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,600
to migrate enterprise applications

80
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
from one printer cloud

81
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,360
and also manage these applications.

82
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,840
When I first started

83
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,520
selling the product to the customers,

84
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,760
not many customers even knew about AWS.

85
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,520
So, it was actually really hard

86
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,360
for them to be convinced

87
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,080
to even take a meeting.

88
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,960
Not just us,

89
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,360
we used to partner with AWS,

90
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,760
so we went for AWS sales reps.

91
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,920
And then, we eventually succeeded.

92
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,360
I grew the business

93
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,855
to about 40 million dollars

94
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,520
[--].

95
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,080
And cloud management platforms

96
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,280
was the one that I created.

97
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,280
But it was less about

98
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,240
being an entrepreneur

99
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,280
or trying to do something.

100
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,640
But the idea was about being passionate

101
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,840
about the technical problem

102
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,160
and trying to solve it.

103
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,680
So, when you talk about, you know,

104
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,360
changing the world in your capacity

105
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,320
throughout these companies,

106
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,360
it sounds to me also

107
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,920
that while you're talking about that,

108
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,920
you all you're also excited

109
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,840
about the technologies

110
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,160
that you're building, right?

111
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,680
These are things

112
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,120
that you're personally curious about

113
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,120
and personally passionate about.

114
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,400
Yeah.

115
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:43,720
Yeah.

116
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,000
So, all of these companies are very

117
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,720
technologically centric companies.

118
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,480
Think of it as an IP centric company

119
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,360
in a very positive way

120
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,040
and not in a negative way.

121
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,680
And I'm very passionate about

122
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,680
using the technology

123
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,200
to make a meaningful change

124
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,480
for somebody.

125
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,200
And even in the second company,

126
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,000
I thought we could use an MP

127
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,240
in a completely different way

128
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,400
to create a conversation.

129
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,200
And 2014

130
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,880
was when we applied for the trademark

131
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,120
of conversational analytics.

132
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,320
And then, that was the company

133
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,640
that I had created.

134
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,120
And then, we were able to create

135
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,560
a meaningful impact

136
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,920
on enterprise customers.

137
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,240
Of course, we got an acquisition offer

138
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,800
much early in the cycle,

139
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
which we could not refuse.

140
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,160
So, we were acquired by Splunk.

141
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,120
But the conversational analytics with me,

142
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,840
meaning it was less about NFV.

143
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,320
We did not use any

144
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,720
open source NFV package.

145
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,080
No stand for NFV.

146
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,800
No other NFV.

147
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,200
So, we had to build the grounds up.

148
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,960
Most of the code

149
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,760
was actually done in assembly.

150
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,160
Really?

151
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,440
We were probably,

152
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,000
only one of the four, five companies

153
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,320
in the whole of Bay Area

154
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
who were working on assembly.

155
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,040
So, we wanted to give that experience,

156
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,480
speed and performance on NFV.

157
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,480
Now, I don't think

158
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,800
I can that actually do that.

159
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,760
But it is about

160
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,240
being passionate to that level.

161
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,720
That's just incredible.

162
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,240
So, passionate to that level.

163
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,640
One of four or five companies

164
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,760
working an assembly

165
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,000
out of the Bay Area in 2014, 2015.

166
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,160
That's just incredible.

167
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,520
So, give me

168
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,480
a spectrum of the technologies

169
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,960
that today in 2020

170
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,560
you're personally excited about.

171
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,640
I'm very excited about NLP.

172
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,560
And I focus a lot of my time at Stanford

173
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,800
on artificial intelligence

174
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,880
of the different applications

175
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,360
that it's going to.

176
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,680
But I'd love to pick your brain

177
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,640
on the different things

178
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,760
that you're particularly excited about

179
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,080
as we enter a new decade now.

180
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,640
As any entrepreneur has to do,

181
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,960
I'm very focused.

182
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:40,240
So, it is not about AI in general,

183
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,440
but application of AI

184
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,960
to solve a very specific problem.

185
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,520
In the current company, in MachEye,

186
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,880
we use AI as an architecture

187
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,200
to give a play button

188
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,440
for the enterprise data

189
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,920
and also to solve a big problem

190
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,560
in AI and to act.

191
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,480
I'll explain what do I mean

192
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,280
by play button for the enterprise data.

193
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,400
So, think of it as

194
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,160
we are bringing

195
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,640
two or three different things in AI

196
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,600
together to provide this benefit.

197
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,160
Number 1 is a Google like

198
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,880
actual search experience,

199
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,920
and it is a lot more than NLP.

200
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,760
And it is about

201
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,360
bringing in an actual search experience

202
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,200
coupled with ambiguity corrections,

203
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,280
coupled with contextual

204
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
search recommendations, etc.

205
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,920
It means that

206
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,160
when a customer is searching

207
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,480
for say, it's Alabama,

208
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,240
we have to figure out

209
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,560
whether Alabama is country,

210
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,480
or a city, or a state, etc. and so on,

211
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,240
that is done by us.

212
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,000
And second,

213
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,320
we understand not only the query,

214
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,960
we answer back instantly.

215
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,480
But we also get the raw data

216
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
and apply a series

217
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,280
of machine learning ones.

218
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,720
And even though

219
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,160
there are a lot of platforms

220
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,480
where somebody

221
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,680
can drag and drop the models

222
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,640
and analyze,

223
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,680
but it doesn't happen

224
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,320
for every enterprise user.

225
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,360
So think of it as a

226
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,240
a coffee store manager

227
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,400
of a large chain.

228
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,320
That store manager

229
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,840
cannot deal with all these models.

230
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,320
So, we do this ML workflow,

231
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,920
ML operations on the fly

232
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,480
at that point in time.

233
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,680
Typical turn around time,

234
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,520
about 300 milliseconds.

235
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,800
Wow.

236
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,240
And we actually choose

237
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
the machine learning models.

238
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,600
We do the

239
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,160
feature parameter identification,

240
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,520
but some of this can happen

241
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,440
in an offline basis, too.

242
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,480
And then finally,

243
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,040
we use energy to produce English.

244
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,680
And then added it as an audio visual.

245
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,800
So, I assume that

246
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,880
a business user is on the go

247
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,360
and he asks the question:

248
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,640
how many chairs do I order

249
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,880
say for an upcoming season?

250
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,960
So, think of it as a retail customer.

251
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,080
And he simply gets an audio visual

252
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,520
on the mobile phone

253
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,400
and starts talking saying that

254
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,360
these are the number of chairs

255
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,240
that you need to order.

256
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,160
But along with the chairs,

257
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,600
you need to buy a tabletop.

258
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,120
Because 38% of the customers

259
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,680
buy tables along with the chairs.

260
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,880
So, this is something

261
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,640
that we need to look at.

262
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,240
So, that intelligence we try to bring up

263
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,080
and then presented at that point in time.

264
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,520
So, that is what we are doing

265
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,840
at MachEye.

266
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,200
And we have built a product

267
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,640
with AI as an architecture

268
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,480
rather than AI as a feature.

269
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,240
So, one of the things

270
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,720
that I'm always curious about is focus.

271
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,760
And one of the things that you mentioned

272
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,120
when I talked about

273
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,160
how I enjoy, you know, exploring

274
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,400
the artificial intelligence field

275
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,560
at Stanford,

276
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,560
you mentioned that as an entrepreneur,

277
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,160
and as a CEO, you enjoy taking AI

278
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,800
into an application level

279
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,240
and solving a real problem,

280
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,160
not just with the

281
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,360
artificial intelligence slowly,

282
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,880
but actually

283
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,920
one of the applications of it.

284
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,840
So, I'm curious,

285
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,640
within a software like MachEye

286
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,440
and within a company

287
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,280
that seems to be doing a lot, right,

288
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,080
you're solving a lot

289
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,640
of different problems in one,

290
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,400
how do you maintain focus

291
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,160
on which are

292
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,640
the really crucial problems to solve

293
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,560
especially if you're just starting out

294
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,560
and you're just exploring

295
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,640
what are your users are doing?

296
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,760
Yes. So, how do we identify the problem?

297
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,000
Number 1, first, trying to identify

298
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,560
what is the business scenario.

299
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,640
So, the business scenario

300
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,160
or the context is business intelligence.

301
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,240
And the business intelligence,

302
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,480
you define the persona.

303
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,760
And then you identify

304
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,360
what these are,

305
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,320
and then try to do that.

306
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,080
Say for example,

307
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,160
in this particular business

308
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,520
intelligence as a market, I think,

309
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,600
there is no use of any [--],

310
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,960
it's just as an example.

311
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,560
And hence, we don't do anything

312
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,078
like I mention,

313
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:12,520
educational intermediary identification

314
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,040
even though it is AI.

315
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,000
But it is more of understanding of data,

316
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,880
understanding or uncovering

317
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,240
the intelligence that is in the data,

318
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,360
automatically to the user.

319
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,680
So, that is a big business call.

320
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,240
And the long term vision of us

321
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,280
is to be a personal business companion

322
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,040
of any enterprise data.

323
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,040
As long as the technology

324
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,040
can fit into the scope and the use case,

325
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,600
we try to stay very focused on that.

326
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,920
So, if you're looking, you know,

327
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,000
10 years in the future about where,

328
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,440
how businesses are utilizing data

329
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,200
to leverage both

330
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,240
their day to day activities,

331
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,600
but also their forecasts

332
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,600
and as they scale,

333
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,040
where are we today

334
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,360
and where do you think

335
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,240
the world will be in 10, 15 years or so?

336
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,120
In terms of where the world is

337
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,080
as of no hour as of yesterday,

338
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,200
without MachEye is that,

339
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,600
a user has to,

340
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,520
or the entire data industries

341
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,200
in this paradigm

342
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,480
of what you ask is what you get.

343
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,280
So, I assume that the business user

344
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,520
wants to know something.

345
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,320
Say, for example,

346
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,840
somebody is asking a question:

347
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,880
how much were the California wildfires

348
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,080
this year?

349
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,640
Okay. It is actually really hard

350
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,440
to get an answer.

351
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,280
But you see, you can get an answer

352
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,280
by way of analyze,

353
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,000
looking at various information,

354
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,720
writing a sequel, etc.

355
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,880
But nothing more than

356
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,760
what the user is asking.

357
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,640
And I envision that pretty soon.

358
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,440
Say us, or maybe other companies

359
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,600
that are going to come up

360
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,000
in the same space.

361
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:43,640
We will overcome that barrier.

362
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,280
So, we would want to answer the questions

363
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,120
that the users are not asking,

364
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,000
or they don't even know

365
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,720
how to ask the questions.

366
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,040
Say, for example,

367
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,520
in this particular scenario,

368
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,840
the California wildfires,

369
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,720
we were told that the wildfires in 2020

370
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,160
has been little over 15 times

371
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,480
of the last year,

372
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,200
or 2020 wildfires were greater than

373
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,600
the sum total of the last

374
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,800
four or five years.

375
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,120
So, that is an intelligence

376
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,040
that the user doesn't know.

377
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,960
And then we could tell that.

378
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,920
And eventually,

379
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,160
what we are working on already

380
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,480
is to be able to produce

381
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,920
this intelligence

382
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,760
without any questions at all.

383
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,880
So, I assume that

384
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,040
we will become click-less,

385
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,280
and also search-less product.

386
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,960
So, I assume that

387
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,160
if I know the business metrics

388
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,960
and the KPIs

389
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,000
that the users are interested in,

390
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,480
we would want to produce intelligence

391
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,760
even without them asking any questions.

392
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,280
And we do that

393
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,920
to some extent already.

394
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,360
And that is how I think

395
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,800
enterprise intelligence will move.

396
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,880
So, what have you learned

397
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,680
over the past three companies

398
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,960
that you've built

399
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,920
about the life cycle of a companies?

400
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,440
So,

401
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,840
either as an entrepreneur

402
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,280
or as a leader or business wise,

403
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,840
what are some really key insights

404
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,960
that you've generated for yourself

405
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,320
as you are now approaching

406
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,280
or you're in the midst

407
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,160
of your fourth venture?

408
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
As an entrepreneur

409
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,360
and as a founder of the company,

410
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,560
this one very important thing

411
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,120
to figure out is,

412
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,760
is there an existing market

413
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,000
that we are going after.

414
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,040
Or are we creating a new market,

415
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,880
new product category.

416
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,800
Say in our case,

417
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,360
it is business intelligence as a market.

418
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,560
And there are budgets,

419
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,360
and the customers

420
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,400
have budget cycles.

421
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,000
And then

422
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,600
it means

423
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,960
that there is also competition

424
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,760
that is a legacy competition

425
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,720
or incumbent vendor.

426
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,280
And it is very important to identify

427
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,080
the difference between these two:

428
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,760
existing or new.

429
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,560
Because the market positioning,

430
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,600
customers budgets,

431
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,040
everything depends on that.

432
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,120
If you're trying to create a new product,

433
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,720
completely new product,

434
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,200
it's a longer sales cycle.

435
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,600
And customers don't have budget.

436
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,560
They can only budget

437
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,440
for a POC this year

438
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,680
and then budget for the,

439
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,920
for the complete implementation

440
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,000
end of next year or two years or so.

441
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,640
So, that is actually the first one

442
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,280
that you need to decide.

443
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,280
And the second thing is,

444
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,280
what is the value add

445
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,520
for the customer.

446
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,080
You can build great,

447
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,360
but if it doesn't deliver

448
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,120
a customer value, again,

449
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,360
customers may not perceived

450
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,800
a value in that.

451
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,200
And third, is that

452
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,120
can your product

453
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,280
stand up on its own,

454
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,720
or does it need an ecosystem

455
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,360
of other things

456
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,640
that need to push the adaption.

457
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,800
So, if somebody can understand

458
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,520
these three things,

459
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,680
it's easier to sell.

460
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,800
Were there any challenges

461
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,360
that kept presenting themselves

462
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,600
that almost seemed

463
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,440
to get easier and easier

464
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,520
with every venture

465
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,040
but they were the same in nature?

466
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,280
So, the same challenge

467
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,920
but you were able to tackle it

468
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,800
with more and more experience?

469
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,720
It is not always the same challenge.

470
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,840
Because if in case you see a challenge,

471
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,960
most of the times in the next venture,

472
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,160
you are better prepared

473
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,600
and you don't see the same challenge.

474
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,800
It is probably a different challenge

475
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,160
that you will encounter.

476
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,520
And in this company,

477
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,600
if I had to tell what is

478
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,880
a technological challenge

479
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,280
that we had to overcome,

480
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,960
was a synchronicity

481
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,680
of this machine learning models.

482
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,640
Some of these models

483
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,560
can take a long time to execute.

484
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,480
And if I had to take the input

485
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,320
from the search

486
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,680
and then instantly produce

487
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,840
the minimum 300 millisecond,

488
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,320
some models may not respond in the time .

489
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,680
So, we had to build an audio

490
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,280
or video engine that works

491
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,360
in synchronicity in nature.

492
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:19,960
So, it means that

493
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,240
as a video starts playing,

494
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,440
we might start appending content to it.

495
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,480
So, the progress bar

496
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,640
can sometimes go backwards

497
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,040
and not just forward.

498
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,120
Because the total time increased,

499
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,160
But we try to make sure that

500
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,800
that experience is seamless

501
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,840
and also present the user experience now

502
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,720
is an easy matter. So, yeah.

503
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,800
What are some other

504
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,520
interesting plans

505
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,080
that you're excited about?

506
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,600
So, obviously a lot of it

507
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,240
is in the world

508
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,400
of what MachEye is doing now,

509
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,360
but what are some other

510
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,640
big picture problems

511
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,400
that you think are worth tackling,

512
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,360
if for example,

513
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,680
young entrepreneurs from Stanford,

514
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,560
or 8200, are listening to this?

515
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,240
I think there is a big opportunity

516
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,240
in the educational space

517
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,160
coming from having built a company

518
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,160
in the educational space,

519
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,120
and in my select few other company,

520
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,840
I think that there is a lot more

521
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,240
bigger opportunity.

522
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,200
The existing platforms and solutions

523
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,920
are a bit monotonous.

524
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,840
And they don't personalized the content,

525
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,440
they don't personalized the delivery.

526
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,960
There is a lot of opportunity.

527
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,280
And as an entrepreneur,

528
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,680
somebody would also have a guarantee

529
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,240
that people would pay for that stuff,

530
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,920
pay for the products that they consume.

531
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,800
So education, in my opinion,

532
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,040
is on the top of the funnel.

533
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,720
And after that,

534
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,080
I think insurance and health care,

535
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,680
I think could go through a lot of change,

536
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,080
assuming that the government don't stop

537
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,240
some things coming into the AI space.

538
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,960
100%.

539
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,240
I mean, obviously with health care,

540
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,400
we've seen a dramatic

541
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,120
acceleration of change

542
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,000
and adaption in 2020.

543
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,080
And I myself,

544
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,360
am also a part of a Hippo Insurance,

545
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,960
an InsureTech company

546
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,720
based in the Bay Area.

547
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,000
So, I can see firsthand

548
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,880
the revolution

549
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,880
that insurance is going through

550
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,920
in this past few years,

551
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,240
and it's just remarkable.

552
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,280
Ramesh, thank you again for both

553
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,760
for coming on the show

554
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,680
and sharing your insights,

555
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,680
but also for allowing myself

556
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,400
and J-Ventures to be a part of your,

557
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,440
hopefully your new success story.

558
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,040
And it's still, it's a remarkable,

559
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,320
I think, for me to think of sitting

560
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,080
in front of somebody who's done it

561
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,000
three times already,

562
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,080
successfully going on the fourth one.

563
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,880
But at the end,

564
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,920
it's not about the money

565
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,720
and it's not about the fame.

566
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,920
It's about being passionate

567
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,680
about the technology,

568
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,880
and passionate about,

569
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,160
about improving the lives

570
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,480
of either people or companies,

571
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,440
or people that are working

572
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,040
their day to day

573
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,640
to ask the most meaningful questions.

574
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,400
And I think that it's really remarkable.

575
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,520
Before we leave,

576
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,120
I have to ask you

577
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,240
the most important question,

578
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,920
which is three words that you would use

579
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,800
to describe yourself.

580
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,640
And why those three words.

581
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,760
So, the three words

582
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,880
I'm just thinking on the fly.

583
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,400
So, number one is that

584
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm very passionate.

585
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,160
About trying to solve the problem,

586
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,800
whether it is working, say,

587
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,520
12 hours, 14 hours a day.

588
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,880
And the second thing is,

589
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,840
I'm very compassionate to the team.

590
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,200
And then I try to think

591
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,040
from their perspective to understand them

592
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,040
and then make sure that I help them.

593
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,040
I encourage them to get things done.

594
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,560
And the third is fun part of it,

595
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,360
making sure that

596
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,600
it's so fun experience every day.

597
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,200
I love it.

598
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:32,560
I love it.

599
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,840
Ramesh, thank you so, so much.

600
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,640
This is so great.

601
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,320
Best of luck with the company.

602
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,520
And I look forward

603
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,560
to keep working with you

604
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,640
over these next few years.

605
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,160
Okay. And thank you for asking

606
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,320
all the good set of questions.

607
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,520
And I appreciate all the enrollment

608
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,200
and then trying to do this.

609
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,920
And good luck with J-Ventures.

610
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,440
Thank you very much. Take care

611
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,560
Okay, thank you. Bye.
