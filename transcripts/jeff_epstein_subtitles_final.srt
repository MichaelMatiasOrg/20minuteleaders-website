1
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,760
Jeff Epstein, thank you so much

2
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,960
for joining us on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,880
It's wonderful to be here.

4
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,000
Thank you for having me.

5
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,560
Okay. So if I started to give

6
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,200
a brief bio about you,

7
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,920
I wouldn't be able to ask you any questions

8
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,280
because 20 minutes would be over.

9
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,320
But just for context.

10
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,360
Previous CFO of Oracle,

11
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,760
but not just any CFO,

12
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,200
because you've also been on the boards

13
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,560
of the coolest companies.

14
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,880
Currently on Twilio and Shutterstock.

15
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,680
Incredible companies.

16
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,360
But you're on the board

17
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,520
of Booking Holdings.

18
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,440
And you joined, you said

19
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,280
when it was a billion dollars in revenues

20
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,360
growing up to 80?

21
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,160
Billion dollars in market value,

22
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,360
growing to 80 billion.

23
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,160
Wow. Okay.

24
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,160
So, billion dollars in market value

25
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,240
going up to 80 billion.

26
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,680
But you're also on the board of

27
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,640
Kaiser Permanente?

28
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,120
Kaiser Permanente is a large

29
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,560
non-profit health care organization

30
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,960
that provides both healthcare,

31
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,960
hospitals and health insurance

32
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,600
for 12 million people,

33
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
mostly in California and

34
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,680
the West Coast.

35
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,720
Unbelievable. And you mentioned

36
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,600
230,000 employees.

37
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,440
Right.

38
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,400
Unbelievable. So, you're

39
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,120
sitting on these boards.

40
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,480
So I'm gonna have to at some point

41
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,640
understand how do you even juggle

42
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,160
all of these different positions

43
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,200
and how do you then take the skills

44
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,880
from the CFO at Oracle and now at Apex,

45
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,360
which hopefully

46
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,320
we'll be able to get to as well.

47
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,480
But Jeff, how do you do it all?

48
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,960
It's a serious question.

49
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,080
I mean when I think of who I want,

50
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,520
the level that I wanna get to

51
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,240
one day and have these

52
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,880
incredible experiences,

53
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,520
you're the persona right now.

54
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,320
Thank you very much.

55
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,560
Well, I spent 25 years working

56
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,800
full time as a chief financial officer

57
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,240
where every day you have people

58
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,040
that report to you and you have a boss

59
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,720
and a board and quarterly earnings.

60
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,480
And that was a lot of responsibility.

61
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,120
Now that I'm retired from full time work,

62
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,440
I serve on these boards but you go to a board meeting -

63
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,120
Retired. Okay.

64
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,080
I just wanna put the word

65
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,280
retired in front of everything

66
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,960
that I just said. Okay.

67
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,160
So the difference between

68
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,280
being a board member is usually

69
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,200
you go to the board meeting,

70
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
you ask a lot of questions.

71
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,120
You say,

72
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,720
"Boy, sounds like you've got a lot of problems.

73
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,960
I'll see you at next board meeting."

74
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,920
And management are the people that

75
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,840
have to fix the problems

76
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,640
we just talk about them.

77
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,040
So, there is a lot of governance responsibility,

78
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,560
and if occasionally if you have to change

79
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,840
the CEO or things like that.

80
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,680
There's a lot of work

81
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,480
but there are certain companies

82
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,560
like Wells Fargo,

83
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,160
and over the last few years,

84
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,760
they've had, there were PG&E going through bankruptcy.

85
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,280
They have a very intense experience,

86
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,800
but if the company is doing well,

87
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,400
it's a lot easier to be a board member

88
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,680
than to the day to day

89
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,560
responsibility of being executive.

90
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,400
Of course. Of course.

91
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,320
And of course -

92
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,400
Very rewarding as well

93
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,360
because my job is to ask questions.

94
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,440
And so, I love learning.

95
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,560
I love asking questions,

96
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,480
and over the year, after 40 years,

97
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,800
you've asked a lot of questions,

98
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
you get to learn a lot.

99
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,440
It reminds me of the nice story

100
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,120
of when you go to the doctor

101
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,200
and something is hurting in your knee

102
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,200
and the doctor hits your knee and says,

103
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,920
"Okay now five hundred dollars, please."

104
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,320
And you ask,

105
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
"What? You just hit the knee?"

106
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,680
And he said,

107
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,080
"No, no, no. I've been studying

108
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,480
for 40 years how to hit your knee."

109
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,840
So, it sounds like the questions

110
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,720
that you're asking now,

111
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,000
they're not just any questions,

112
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,040
they're questions with dozens of years

113
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,920
and a wealth of experience

114
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,200
that you bring with you.

115
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,480
Right. Exactly.

116
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,280
I'll give you an example of a board meeting

117
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:12,840
and I've been trying to talk

118
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,720
to some of my CEOs about this.

119
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,320
Many of the people on this call might have

120
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,760
actually participated in a board meeting.

121
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,840
And in my mind, there's sort

122
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,040
of three parts to a board meeting.

123
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,120
There's the compliance part,

124
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,800
the audit committee report,

125
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,200
compensation committee,

126
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,800
things like that,

127
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,320
which in a private company

128
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:27,920
is very short.

129
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,000
In a public company

130
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,520
it's there's some amount of time.

131
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,640
And then the remainder of the time

132
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,720
often is the management telling the board

133
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,760
what they've been doing.

134
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,200
Reporting on what's going on.

135
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,660
Here's our

136
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,520
product strategy

137
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,360
Here's our sales and marketing strategy.

138
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,640
Here's our forecast.

139
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,960
I call that the show and tell part.

140
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,640
And then there's another

141
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,320
part of the meeting,

142
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,840
the third part, which is

143
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,960
here are decisions

144
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,000
we're thinking about,

145
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,480
but we haven't made them yet,

146
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,920
and we'd like to tell you

147
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,960
We have three choices

148
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,240
and here's the pros and cons

149
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,840
of each choice.

150
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,960
We recommend option A.

151
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,160
We're planning on doing option A.

152
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,240
But what do you think?

153
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,640
And maybe your questions

154
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,560
and your guidance will change our mind.

155
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,840
So, should we grow faster

156
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,000
and burn more money,

157
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,760
lose more money,

158
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,720
or should we grow slower and make more money?

159
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,240
Right.

160
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,960
We have one product just in the US.

161
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,560
Should we add a second product in the US,

162
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,760
or should we take our first product

163
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,280
and expand to the UK?

164
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,800
Those kinds of decisions.

165
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,960
So, I personally find the decisions we have

166
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,760
not yet made to be a much more valuable

167
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,080
board meeting as opposed

168
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,040
to the show and tell.

169
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,320
And the show and tell, in my view,

170
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,080
can be done in writing.

171
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,960
Put everything, create this big presentation,

172
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,760
send it out to the board

173
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,560
a week in advance.

174
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,840
We'll read it all.

175
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,680
We'll ask questions

176
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,360
if we don't understand it,

177
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,120
but to spend most of the board time

178
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,400
just telling us what's in the written material

179
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,800
is to me not taking full advantage of the board.

180
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,440
So that's an example of the kind

181
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,640
of thing that I've learned over the years,

182
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,040
which 20 years ago,

183
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,120
I probably didn't understand.

184
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,200
Now I try to nudge my CEOs

185
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,040
in that direction.

186
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,480
How would you describe your relationship

187
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,600
with your CEOs as a board member?

188
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,120
And you have quite a few CEOs

189
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,680
that you have to be in touch with.

190
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,160
Is this a friendly relationship?

191
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:06,040
Is this more of a boss-employee relationship?

192
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,760
What's the intimacy like over there?

193
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,280
Well, it depends.

194
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,320
If I work for the venture capital partners

195
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,640
or private equity partners,

196
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,600
they essentially,

197
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,480
they are appointed by their firm

198
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,920
or the private equity firm

199
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,480
Maybe they hire the CEO.

200
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,920
In the companies that I'm involved in,

201
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,040
personally because I'm always an independent,

202
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,680
the CEO meets me and personally

203
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,600
wants, recruits me to the board.

204
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,760
So, the CEO essentially

205
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,600
hired me to be a board member.

206
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,360
And essentially,

207
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,040
the CEO can fire me if they decide

208
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,330
they don't like me on the board.

209
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,400
It's never happened, but they could.

210
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:44,120
And so, my role is to help

211
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,440
make the CEO as effective

212
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,000
as he or she could be.

213
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,720
And so, it's by asking questions,

214
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:52,320
by telling stories and anecdotes.

215
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,320
So, one way to think about it is,

216
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,840
My dogs in the background
I don't know if you can hear it sorry -

217
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:01,320
I love it. It just adds. It adds.

218
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,840
So, Mark Twain said that

219
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,040
history doesn't repeat itself,

220
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,400
but it does rhyme.

221
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,240
And so, if I've been involved

222
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,360
in a company before

223
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,760
that had a similar problem,

224
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,560
I might tell the story.

225
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,720
Here's what the situation was.

226
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,520
It sounds similar.

227
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,160
Here's what they did.

228
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,120
Here's what happened.

229
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,840
But that doesn't mean

230
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,760
you should do the same thing

231
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,640
because every situation's different.

232
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,680
Right.

233
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,160
And so can we stop for a minute

234
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,720
I'm gonna see if I could get the dogs quiet.

235
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,520
No problem.

236
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,400
You'll have to edit that part out.

237
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,360
No worries at all.

238
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:45,800
Okay

239
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,880
That's what's nice about this

240
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,940
spontaneousness of this is

241
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,040
that these things just add

242
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,800
because it creates much more

243
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,480
of I think of an intimacy

244
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,600
with my friends from Tel Aviv

245
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,920
and Stanford who are viewing this

246
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,240
because it's not edited.

247
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
There's no agenda

248
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,280
to make it look perfect.

249
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,040
It's as if we're having coffee

250
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,720
and we're just sharing

251
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,040
with them our coffee.

252
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,680
Okay. Right.

253
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,840
So, you were telling me about Mark Twain.

254
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,600
Yeah. So, Mark Twain said

255
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,920
history doesn't repeat itself,

256
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,240
but it does rhyme.

257
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,240
And so my interpretation of that is

258
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,760
if I'm at a board meeting

259
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,640
and something comes up with the company

260
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,560
and there's a challenge or a problem,

261
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,960
I'll say: Well, in two or three other

262
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,320
situations, I had a similar

263
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,360
type of situation.

264
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,920
Here's what the situation was.

265
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,280
Here's what the company did.

266
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,720
It worked or it didn't work.

267
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,280
That doesn't mean that you, the CEO,

268
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,120
should do the same thing

269
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,560
because your situation is gonna be

270
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,640
somewhat different.

271
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:35,400
But if you never had any similar experience,

272
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,480
you're flying blind

273
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,440
whereas if you have the benefit of mine

274
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,080
or other people's experience,

275
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,200
you can triangulate and piece together

276
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,040
the pieces of the puzzle and say,

277
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,720
"Well, I think this is relevant."

278
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,520
And then you make up your own mind.

279
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:51,320
So, I basically work as a board member,

280
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,640
not by telling people what to do,

281
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,720
but by asking questions

282
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,960
and by telling stories.

283
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,840
I think that's incredible.

284
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,080
And I haven't gotten to that position

285
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,040
and I very much hope to one day

286
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,600
be able to be a CEO

287
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,640
where you're on the board of.

288
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,600
So wait for that request one day.

289
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,320
But it sounds to me

290
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,800
that a lot of these things

291
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,600
you can look up online

292
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,040
and read case studies

293
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,960
from business schools

294
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,280
and understand that

295
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,120
how you get to point B from point A.

296
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,000
But it sounds like

297
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,440
a lot of the added benefit

298
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,520
that you would bring to the table

299
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,680
is not just A and then B,

300
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,680
but it's the whole process

301
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,960
and the whole, and the relationships

302
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,000
and the intricacies that

303
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,880
and the complexity that goes into it.

304
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,200
So, you know all the details

305
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,960
of the whole process

306
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,280
and not just the outcome, right.

307
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,480
Yeah it's not only the details,

308
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,400
it's also the emotional impact

309
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,640
of having lived through it.

310
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,040
Right.

311
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,240
So, you've probably heard the phrase,

312
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,280
"Raise money when you can,

313
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,840
not when you need it"

314
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,040
And if you hear that, you say,

315
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,840
"Okay well that makes sense.

316
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:46,880
That's logical."

317
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,720
But I've actually lived through it

318
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,320
and I'll tell you that story.

319
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,960
I was the CFO of DoubleClick

320
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,440
during the Internet boom.

321
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,440
And our stock went from,

322
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,080
we went public

323
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,080
at $250 million at market value,

324
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,720
and we were up to $11 billion.

325
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,080
So, we were trading at 22 times revenue,

326
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,920
a huge price.

327
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,840
We're still losing money.

328
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,680
We're growing fast.

329
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,760
And we were the leading Internet

330
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,600
advertising technology company.

331
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,040
But by any measure,

332
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,800
the company was fully valued.

333
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,360
I mean, we clearly weren't undervalued.

334
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,560
And so we decided to raise money.

335
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,640
And we did a follow-on offering

336
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,560
and we were in the market

337
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,200
raising $700 million.

338
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,400
It's a public company.

339
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,520
And we had a roadshow

340
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,720
which started Monday morning.

341
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,520
We were at a price Thursday night.

342
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,240
And on Wednesday at lunch,

343
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,600
I'm presenting to investors

344
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,400
at a luncheon meeting

345
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,720
and I get a call from my office.

346
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,480
The message said, "Call NASDAQ".

347
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,720
So, I call NASDAQ and they say,

348
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,080
"You know, we have a problem."

349
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,200
And I go, "Really? What's the problem?"

350
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,720
And he said, "Well, we have a lot of sell orders."

351
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,220
And I said, "Really? Well how many?"

352
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,600
And he says, "Well, we have so many sell orders

353
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,960
and no buying interest

354
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,000
that we're stopping

355
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,080
trading in your stock."

356
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,280
And so, for the rest

357
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,160
of that Wednesday afternoon,

358
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,840
our stock ... trade.

359
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,800
And what had happened was

360
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,200
there was an article in USA Today

361
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
that morning about how DoubleClick

362
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,400
was violating people's privacy.

363
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,960
And that just spooked investors.

364
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,360
They didn't know what to think about it.

365
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,640
So, we sit with our investment bankers

366
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,160
Wednesday night and we say

367
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,000
"What's gonna happen?"

368
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,480
And they predict accurately

369
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,680
that the stock's gonna open up

370
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,480
tomorrow morning, down 20%.

371
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,520
So, a nine billion dollar valuation.

372
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,120
And the question is,

373
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,040
should we just pull the offering

374
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,040
or should we go ahead with the offering

375
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,360
at the 20% lower valuation?

376
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,160
And my feeling was the price

377
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,520
that it was yesterday is irrelevant.

378
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,320
The question is, is nine billion a fair price

379
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,000
Yes or no.

380
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,800
And for a company with

381
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,320
500 million in revenue losing money,

382
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,880
I thought that was a very,

383
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,400
still a very good valuation.

384
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,680
And even though we had

385
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,640
200 million in cash,

386
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,480
we didn't need the money.

387
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,520
I thought it was just a sensible thing

388
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,160
to raise money when you can.

389
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,680
So, I recommended and then

390
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,520
we went ahead and raised money.

391
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,480
And then of course, the whole market

392
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,800
Internet market collapsed.

393
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,040
The advertising market collapsed.

394
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,320
Our revenue over the next two years

395
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,620
dropped by 50% from

396
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,760
500 million to 250 million.

397
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,360
But we had 700 million in cash.

398
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,000
So, we had a very strong balance sheet.

399
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,080
So, it's one thing to say it,

400
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,800
it's another to live through it.

401
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,280
That's unbelievable.

402
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,400
So, and we all have,

403
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,360
if you're old enough,

404
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,840
you'll all have stories like that.

405
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,600
That's just unbelievable.

406
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,120
And of course,

407
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,000
throughout this whole thing,

408
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,080
I gently forgot to mention that

409
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,240
that you are teaching

410
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,040
one of the most popular courses

411
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,720
at Stanford,

412
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,320
which I very much hope

413
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,720
to take myself one day.

414
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,400
Hopefully this upcoming winter.

415
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,720
And you're also an operating partner

416
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,520
at Bessemer,

417
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,160
one of the world's leading

418
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,880
venture capital firm.

419
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,600
What do you do there?

420
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,400
What does that even mean

421
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,320
an operational partner?

422
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,760
Well I'll talk about that,

423
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,400
but I do want to talk

424
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,680
about the class, too.

425
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,760
Yes.

426
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,720
An operating partner means

427
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,880
I'm not an investing partner.

428
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,200
So I don't make any decisions

429
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,920
to invest customers money.

430
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,060
I can invest my own money,

431
00:14:39,065 --> 00:14:40,840
side by side with Bessemer.

432
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,800
And since I was a career CFO

433
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,720
what I've done is

434
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,360
I've created a CFO advisory board

435
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,120
among Bessemer's portfolio company CFOs.

436
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,240
So, we have 100 portfolio company CFOs

437
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,440
And in any company,

438
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:56,160
there might be 100 or 200 or 300 employees,

439
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,800
that CFO probably has no one else

440
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,680
in the company to talk to about

441
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,680
a finance related issue.

442
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,080
Right.

443
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,920
But across the portfolio,

444
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,520
there's a hundred people to talk to.

445
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,480
So we meet, pre-covid times, we meet in person

446
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,120
once a quarter.

447
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,040
Now we're meeting online.

448
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,400
We have an online platform where people

449
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,560
are asking each other questions

450
00:15:10,563 --> 00:15:11,800
a couple times a week.

451
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,200
There's a big database of questions

452
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,680
over the last seven years.

453
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,360
So, it's a very rich valuable resource

454
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,760
of a peer group

455
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,200
among our portfolio companies.

456
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,520
And so I do that with the CFOs.

457
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,160
And then the CEOs

458
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,040
I help them in business or finance

459
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,720
or capital raising questions

460
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,080
or operation questions as well.

461
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,760
Wow.

462
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,520
But about the class,

463
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,920
what the Lean LaunchPad class is

464
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,480
It's in the winter quarter.

465
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,800
It's Engineering 245

466
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,040
in the Graduate School of Engineering

467
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,800
but business students typically

468
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,280
are half the class.

469
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,640
And it's teams of four or five students

470
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,680
with a startup idea.

471
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,200
And in 10 weeks they're required

472
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,640
to interview 100 potential customers.

473
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,040
Wow.

474
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,840
Build multiple prototypes,

475
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,360
have run many experiments,

476
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,000
and with any luck,

477
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,160
they generate their first revenue

478
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,080
by the tenth week.

479
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,200
And we've had now,

480
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,080
I guess this will be my eighth year teaching.

481
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:08,440
So, we've had quite a 100 teams or so,

482
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,320
graduate from the class.

483
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:13,360
And we've had maybe 15 teams

484
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,880
actually form companies and get funding

485
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,720
and some of them are doing quite well -

486
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,720
Wow. That's huge.

487
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,240
... revenues

488
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,920
and some very exciting companies.

489
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,760
One of them is fresh technologies,

490
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,880
which is AI for grocery ordering.

491
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,160
One is Zoom

492
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,840
which is Uber for children

493
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,120
or for schools type of system.

494
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:39,200
One of them is Nova, which is financial.

495
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,480
It's getting credit for ... immigrants

496
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,120
who might otherwise

497
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,760
find it hard to get credit.

498
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,480
So, a lot of really interesting

499
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,600
ideas and it's terrific.

500
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,760
I just love working with these

501
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,000
incredibly talented students.

502
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And it's a great experience

503
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,920
for the students to get

504
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,080
as close to running a business

505
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,280
while you're still, without dropping out.

506
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,720
So it's a ...

507
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,800
experiential class.

508
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,400
I just get inspired by you.

509
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,520
Again in the first few minutes

510
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,960
you mentioned that you're retired,

511
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,000
and I think it just speaks to your passion

512
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,270
to everything that you're doing,

513
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,000
that you're considering yourself retired,

514
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,840
yet you do more than

515
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:15,110
people do in a lifetime.

516
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,480
To me, I mean, that's really the inspiration.

517
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,040
You know all the tips and tricks

518
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,270
they're amazing.

519
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:19,880
Very insightful.

520
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,840
But the fact that at the end

521
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,480
I get to speak to somebody who's

522
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,680
calling themselves retired,

523
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,160
yet they're doing extraordinary things.

524
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,080
I mean almost everything

525
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,760
that you're doing here

526
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,480
is world class level that

527
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,560
any amazing entrepreneur

528
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,750
would wish they could do.

529
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,840
To me, that's inspiring

530
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,800
and that's definitely

531
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,000
one of my goals in life

532
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,440
to be able to say that I'm retired

533
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,030
yet work as much as you do.

534
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,030
Jeff, I have to ask, CFO Oracle,

535
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,720
everybody knows Oracle

536
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,400
and the incredible things

537
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,320
that this company has done.

538
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,310
You've seen it also earlier on.

539
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,720
What does even a CFO do?

540
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,680
I don't get to speak to many

541
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,830
CFOs in my daily life.

542
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,480
Well, of course, the CFO at any size

543
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,750
company does is responsible for

544
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,720
the same functions.

545
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,040
Accounting, treasury

546
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,680
risk, capital raising,

547
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,160
financial planning and forecasting.

548
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,240
The difference is, is that

549
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,200
when I was the CFO of DoubleClick years ago,

550
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,480
I started out we had 180 people

551
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,960
and I probably did 25% of the work myself.

552
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,720
I would run the Excel models myself.

553
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,640
And then I ... the investor presentation myself.

554
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,160
And then I delegate 75% of the time.

555
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,280
You know you start off in your career

556
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,320
you do 100% yourself.

557
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,550
You have no one to delegate to.

558
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,070
Right.

559
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,760
At that time I was a manager.

560
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,520
I had a team.

561
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,360
Initially I had a team of maybe 10 people.

562
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:37,040
It grew to, probably at the peak there,

563
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,550
I would say maybe

564
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,760
a 100 people in finance

565
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,720
out of two thousand,

566
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,030
typically 5% of the head counts in finance.

567
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,800
But at Oracle,

568
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,270
I did virtually zero percent personally

569
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,920
and delegated 100%.

570
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,400
So, if I had written the

571
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,640
investor relations presentation myself,

572
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,600
the head of investor relations

573
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,200
would have said,

574
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,480
"You know why am I here?"

575
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,640
So, even if I have ideas

576
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,400
about investor relations,

577
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,720
the best way to do is to sit down with

578
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,960
the head of investor relations and say,

579
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,120
"You know here are some of my ideas,

580
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,480
but, you know, you go off and do it

581
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,550
and then I'll give you some guidance."

582
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,760
But fundamentally,

583
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,000
it's a leadership role as opposed to,

584
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,280
and it's a decision making role

585
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,510
as opposed to a doing

586
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,680
role so it changes quite a bit.

587
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,600
Oracle is an incredibly

588
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,640
well-run organization

589
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,480
and has been for decades.

590
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,160
And 40% profit margins.

591
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,040
And just extremely good

592
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,070
at what it does.

593
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,510
And how do you go through that transition?

594
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,790
I mean, yourself going and

595
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,480
having to see a company

596
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,440
through its early stages

597
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,070
to its more advanced stages.

598
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,200
How do you even get yourself to understand

599
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,240
because it's different orders

600
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:52,640
of magnitude for the problems, right?

601
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,400
We're back.

602
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,080
Wonderful.

603
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,480
I might have, I don't know it's my internet connection
Sorry about that

604
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,720
No worries.

605
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,520
What I was asking, though,

606
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,240
which was I think it's very interesting.

607
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,600
I mean, you've grown as a CFO

608
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,440
from early stage startups,

609
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,880
in terms of annual revenues,

610
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,310
all the way up to the billions.

611
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,280
It can't be the same mindset

612
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,720
and the same day to day

613
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,520
responsibilities and thinking.

614
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,280
You have to be transitioning yourself.

615
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,720
What is that like transitioning from

616
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,680
millions to billions?

617
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,320
Well, I did it over 25 years.

618
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,200
It wasn't overnight.

619
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,640
Still sounds very fast.

620
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,160
That is a big difference.

621
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:09,080
And between DoubleClick and Oracle,

622
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,920
I was the CFO of a big group at Nielsen,

623
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,800
the television ratings

624
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,920
and the Internet ratings company.

625
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,560
So, they were a global company

626
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,880
with many thousands of employees.

627
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:21,000
So, I had that exposure to large companies.

628
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,680
One difference that Larry Ellison, years ago,

629
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,550
the founder and chairman of Oracle.

630
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,200
Oracle started with a country structure,

631
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,800
grew very fast in the early days,

632
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,240
and they had Oracle US,

633
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,080
Oracle UK,

634
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,480
Oracle Japan.

635
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,840
And one day around,

636
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,790
I'd say 20 years ago, he said,

637
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,750
"We are a big company now,

638
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,520
but we're operating like

639
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,880
seventy five small companies.

640
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,840
And what we should do is centralize

641
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,400
and to take advantage of ... scale"

642
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,520
And so over the course of about two years,

643
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,760
they went from a 75 different

644
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,560
country structure

645
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:57,350
to one global structure.

646
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,160
So, each country had its own CEO

647
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,160
and its own CFO.

648
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,160
And then when it was all over,

649
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,280
there was no other CEOs,

650
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,960
no other CFOs.

651
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,120
I was the only person in Oracle

652
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,040
with the title of CFO.

653
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,920
There was only global controller,

654
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,790
one head of marketing.

655
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,200
Things like that.

656
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,920
And there are tradeoffs.

657
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,520
It can be centralized or decentralized.

658
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,880
But Oracle was

659
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,960
an example of an extreme case

660
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,720
of very effective

661
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,880
and efficient centralization.

662
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,040
In contrast, Booking Holdings grew

663
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,880
through acquisition

664
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,760
and we own booking.com,

665
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,600
Priceline, Kayak, Open Table,

666
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,680
and other companies

667
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,920
and each of those businesses

668
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,600
had its own,

669
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,400
not only its own CEO and CFO,

670
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,640
but had its own complete business.

671
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:38,310
There was almost no shared resources.

672
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,680
And it also ran extremely well

673
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,000
as a very decentralized

674
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,040
entrepreneurial organization.

675
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,760
So there's no right answer.

676
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:48,000
But I think whichever strategy you have

677
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,520
you want to execute it well.

678
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,760
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

679
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,600
Jeff, I can't believe

680
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
our time is almost up.

681
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,110
It's so sad every time.

682
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,790
You know, give me

683
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,320
one or two earned secrets,

684
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,440
true earned secrets

685
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,760
that you would give me

686
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,640
a young entrepreneur,

687
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,000
just starting my journey.

688
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,400
Hopefully going to try to make an impact

689
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,790
and a dent on the world in a positive way.

690
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,640
What are really extraordinary things

691
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,280
that I should be keeping in mind

692
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,200
over the next decade

693
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,640
as I pursue this dream?

694
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,400
Well let me answer that in two ways.

695
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,360
For entrepreneurs, if you're starting

696
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,440
a company from scratch,

697
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,200
what we teach in this class is

698
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,480
the first step is to get

699
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,110
to product market fit.

700
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,960
And so, what you wanted my advice

701
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,110
for most companies, software companies,

702
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,200
is to try to create

703
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,000
the smallest possible product

704
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,720
with the smallest ever customers

705
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,640
who love you a lot.

706
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,720
And Paul Graham

707
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
...

708
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,320
puts it this way.

709
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,880
He said "You'd rather have 10 customers

710
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:47,480
who love you,

711
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
than a million customers

712
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,960
who like you"

713
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,200
And the logic is,

714
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,560
if you've created a product

715
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,560
that 10 customers love,

716
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,760
I'm pretty confident

717
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,600
you could find an 11th

718
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,280
and then you can find a 12th.

719
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,240
But if you have a lot of customers

720
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:58,720
who just like you, you know

721
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,000
tomorrow they're gonna go on

722
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,240
and like something else.

723
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,480
Right.

724
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,200
So you wanna start a small, and

725
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,070
if you think about

726
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,830
Facebook started just at Harvard

727
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,640
and within two weeks,

728
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,110
he had 90% of all Harvard students

729
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,960
loving Facebook.

730
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,360
And Airbnb started with literally

731
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,590
renting an airbed in someone's apartment.

732
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,160
So they started with a very small product

733
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,110
view and a very small number of customers,

734
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,350
but they built huge companies.

735
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,080
And so, I think you can't build

736
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,310
a jet engine company that way,

737
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,000
but for many businesses you can.

738
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,550
That's on the entrepreneur side.

739
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,720
If you're an employee,

740
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,480
my favorite sort of tactic is,

741
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,240
if when you're interviewing for a job,

742
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,160
you're gonna have a boss and ask your boss,

743
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,440
tell your boss this, say,

744
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,480
"Listen, let's pretend you hire me.

745
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,830
Let's imagine you hire me.

746
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,280
And a year from now you're sitting

747
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,160
giving me my performance review."

748
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,520
And you say,

749
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,200
"Boy, I made a great decision Jeff, hiring you,

750
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,240
for the following three

751
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,040
because you've accomplished

752
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,960
the following three things."

753
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,920
What are those three things?

754
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,160
What it does is

755
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,160
it forces your hiring manager

756
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,280
to crystallize what his

757
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,240
or her expectations are of you.

758
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,280
And then if you know exactly what

759
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,240
the expectations are,

760
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,920
then you can exceed them.

761
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:09,800
Can I reverse that

762
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,560
and use that as the hiring manager

763
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,760
as a tactic to really align expectations

764
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,240
properly and sort of give my ideal

765
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,840
performance review ahead of time

766
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,680
and then have them try to match it

767
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,830
throughout the year?

768
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,640
Yeah, I think that's a great

769
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,720
a second application. And then a third application is -

770
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,760
I love it.

771
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,840
when you start a new job

772
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,760
and you haven't already

773
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,640
had that conversation, have that conversation with your boss

774
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,720
the first week of your job

775
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:39,040
because ... a good leader will do that anyway.

776
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,280
But many managers and leaders

777
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,320
aren't experienced

778
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,760
and just don't know that tactic.

779
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,400
And then you can go for a long time

780
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,880
thinking you're doing

781
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,680
what you should be doing

782
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,600
and realizing that you're not necessarily

783
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,550
focused on the top goals.

784
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,440
I imagine that grows in a few

785
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,080
orders of magnitude in tech

786
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,520
when a lot of leaders

787
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,920
are not necessarily leaders,

788
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,600
but they are more tech experts

789
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,400
who've grown to be team leaders

790
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,520
organically through their organization.

791
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,400
Yeah. A similar example,

792
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,110
I focused there on three things,

793
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,960
but an even more powerful technique

794
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,550
is to focus on one thing.

795
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,920
So I sat at a dinner party once

796
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,790
next to George Roberts of KKR,

797
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,960
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts,

798
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,790
and we were talking about

799
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,440
the problems of education in America.

800
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,960
And he said, "You know, Jeff,

801
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,760
if you could do one thing to improve

802
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:25,400
education in America, what would be?"

803
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,920
And I had thought a lot about education,

804
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:29,310
but I actually never thought of that particular

805
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,400
If I only could do one thing,

806
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,280
what's the one most important thing?

807
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,760
And I realize that's actually

808
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
the best question to ask

809
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,550
many people in many circumstances.

810
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,240
Whatever your basement situation,

811
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,200
just say, "If you could do one thing,

812
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,360
what's the one most important

813
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,520
thing you could do?"

814
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,760
It's incredibly powerful.

815
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,680
I love it. I just love it.

816
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,070
Jeff, before we leave,

817
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,160
I have to ask you a question

818
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,800
that I ask every person on the show,

819
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,600
and I'm especially curious to hear your answer.

820
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,160
I'd love to hear three words

821
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,400
that you would use to describe yourself,

822
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:59,000
or if I were to ask any of the CEOs

823
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,160
that you've worked with,

824
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,720
whether they're at Shutterstock or

825
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,310
Booking or Kaiser,

826
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,400
what would they think of

827
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,830
when they think of Jeff Epstein?

828
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,240
Curious.

829
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,640
Analytical.

830
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,760
Helpful.

831
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,280
I love it.

832
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,760
Jeff, thank you so much for the inspiration.

833
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:16,960
Thank you for the time.

834
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,840
I can't even imagine how you're juggling

835
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,640
everything that you're doing

836
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,680
yet you're still giving me these 20 minutes.

837
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,680
And so thank you for your generosity.

838
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,880
I'll add that as the fourth word.

839
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,590
Stay safe and stay healthy.

840
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,640
Great Michael, thank you very much.

841
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,920
And I'll see you in class in the winter.

842
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,200
Well, I'm sorry to say,

843
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,680
you actually have to apply to the class

844
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,920
and get accepted.

845
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,040
So ... application.

846
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,680
I'm just putting in the hint,

847
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,480
but I'll definitely apply.

848
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,040
Sounds good.

849
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,520
I'm planting the seeds.

850
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:44,920
Okay.

851
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,310
Take care. Bye bye.

852
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:46,520
Bye.
