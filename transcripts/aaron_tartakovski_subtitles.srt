20
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,960
All right, Aaron Tartakovsky,

21
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,840
thank you for being on the show.

22
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,920
Thank you very much.

23
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,800
And you said my last name perfectly,

24
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,880
which is not easy to do.

25
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,760
I've been rehearsing for quite some time,

26
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,920
as you know.

27
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,840
So, I'm very excited to talk about.

28
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,120
What are you doing with Epic Clean Tec?

29
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,160
It's probably one of the best names

30
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,640
for a startup that I've ever heard.

31
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,520
And from the few lines

32
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,800
that I read about the company,

33
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,000
I think it does justice

34
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,160
to how awesome what you're doing is.

35
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,520
But right before we get there,

36
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,560
I'd love to go back

37
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,960
and talk a little bit about your background

38
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,640
and where you came from.

39
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,720
Because you've had an interesting

40
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,960
mix of studying both at Tufts.

41
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,840
But then at Tufts University to APAC.

42
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,040
And now also an investor at Jay Ventures.

43
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,440
So, talk to me a little bit about

44
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,320
who you are.

45
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,920
And how you got to found a company

46
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,920
called Epic Clean Tec.

47
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,480
Yeah. Well, again, thank you for having me.

48
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,920
Look, you know my background.

49
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,000
It's not a straight line.

50
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,680
I went a lot of different places.

51
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,360
I think on paper,

52
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,320
what I'm doing now

53
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,960
doesn't make a lot of sense.

54
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,440
You know, I'm born and raised as

55
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,400
nice Jewish boy from San Francisco.

56
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,080
I went to school in Boston

57
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,640
And in Boston,

58
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,920
I got really involved in politics.

59
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,040
I got involved in politics

60
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,920
around the Middle East,

61
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,560
around US-Israel policy.

62
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,760
So I always knew

63
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,400
that I was going to eventually

64
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,560
go and spend more time in Israel.

65
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
Why by the way?

66
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,680
Well, you know, coming from San Francisco,

67
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,480
going to Boston.

68
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,280
Why do you get so passionate

69
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,680
and involved with politics there?

70
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,920
This is a long story.

71
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,800
It's not just about me.

72
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,440
This is more of a family story.

73
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,000
So my grandfather,

74
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,080
like a lot of people in Israel,

75
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,960
but also a lot of Jews

76
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,160
and all around the world.

77
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,640
We trace our roots to Poland.

78
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,160
And my grandfather as a young teenager

79
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,400
was involved in these

80
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,800
youth Zionist groups.

81
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,960
And he was the leader of the

82
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,840
youth Zionist group in his little shtetl

83
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,240
in the middle of nowhere, Poland.

84
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,400
And for him, you know,

85
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,440
it was always a dream.

86
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,960
One day to have

87
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,440
a modern day state of Israel.

88
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,120
And that's always been important to me.

89
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,040
Not just because it's what we read every day

90
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,400
in the Haggadah and everything else.

91
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,080
But to have,

92
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,320
in Israel is a miracle now.

93
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:45,920
And I always wanted

94
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,200
to be involved in that.

95
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,360
And when it comes to politics,

96
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,480
America is a special place

97
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,280
where we can get involved in politics.

98
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,280
We can make changes through politics.

99
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,040
Very special.

100
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,080
I have a father who is from his refusenik

101
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,000
from the Soviet Union.

102
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,160
Where the thought of going

103
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,760
and actually lobbying for change

104
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,680
with your elected officials

105
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,280
was something that was possible.

106
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,680
And I was very aware that

107
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,720
I had the special privilege.

108
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,560
And so I got involved in college.

109
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,720
That's something that I carried with me.

110
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,600
I studied history and Jewish studies.

111
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,080
So, again, on paper,

112
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,080
I probably should have become

113
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,240
Priester or Rabbi.

114
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,760
Neither of those things happened.

115
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,640
You settled for crazy entrepreneur.

116
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,680
I settle for crazy entrepreneur

117
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,760
who works with toilets for a living.

118
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,400
Yeah. So, a weird story.

119
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,520
That says it all.

120
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,240
So, Aaron, you find yourself in Tel Aviv.

121
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,240
You spend some time there.

122
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,600
And then you go to a AIPAC.

123
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,120
What do you do at AIPAC?

124
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,840
At AIPAC I worked in development.

125
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,040
So it was my job to raise money

126
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,480
and to educate everyone

127
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,240
on the issues of importance to us.

128
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,200
Issues like US-Israelis relationship.

129
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,320
Issues like collaboration on

130
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,520
not just military things,

131
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,320
but on medicine,

132
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,720
on technology and energy.

133
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,280
And then also

134
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,200
focusing on big world issues

135
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,680
like the Iran nuclear program.

136
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,800
So those were the things that I was

137
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,320
really focused on when I was at it.

138
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,960
Wow. Okay. And now,

139
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,720
So, now let's just jump forward

140
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,280
at what do you do with toilets?

141
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,600
Why are you so excited

142
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,200
and passionate about toilets?

143
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,520
Yeah, that's a good question.

144
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,000
So, at Epic Clean Tec,

145
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,640
what we're doing is

146
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,400
we are basically rethinking

147
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,720
how cities handle both their water

148
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,960
and their wastewater.

149
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,960
A lot of times we also

150
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,280
call wastewater sewage.

151
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,040
Right.

152
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,360
You know, when it comes to cities,

153
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,520
we've essentially been doing things

154
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,320
the same way for about 200 years.

155
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,800
Which is to say we have buildings

156
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,960
then into sewers along can

157
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,840
complicate underground networks

158
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,440
that off to central treatment sites.

159
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,120
Right.

160
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,920
And that approach has worked.

161
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,680
But we've essentially been doing things

162
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,440
the same way that all of our cities,

163
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,320
with more and more people

164
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,200
moving into cities.

165
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,200
About 70% of the world's population

166
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
living in cities by 2050.

167
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,840
We're putting more strain.

168
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,920
All of these pipes

169
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,840
and all these facilities

170
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,560
that were installed

171
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,840
30 to 100 years ago.

172
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,320
Right.

173
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,000
Actually we at Epic,

174
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,320
We got our roots with the

175
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,680
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

176
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,000
I was just about to ask

177
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
because I know that Bill and Melinda,

178
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,320
they work vehemently on this topic

179
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,240
of the better infrastructure for toilets, right?

180
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:11,640
Absolutely. Yeah.

181
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,960
So, the Gates Foundation,

182
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,680
they have something called

183
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,320
the Reinvent the toilet challenge.

184
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,720
And what that said was billions of people

185
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,080
around the world don't have access

186
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,400
to clean water, reliable sanitation.

187
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,280
We can't continue to just build things

188
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:23,680
the same way.

189
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,960
We have in building big,

190
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,920
complicated underground infrastructure.

191
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,080
How do we create new,

192
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,120
inexpensive aboveground solutions

193
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,640
that we can deploy quickly?

194
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,760
So our company, me, and my co-founder,

195
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,640
has start of all of this,

196
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,960
came out of the Gates Foundation.

197
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,680
Sort of designing interesting

198
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
toilet applications.

199
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
And by the way,

200
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,320
the real real genesis of the whole story

201
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,320
goes back to the sidewalks of Tel Aviv.

202
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,320
One of my co-founders Oded

203
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,800
was walking down the streets

204
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,720
of Tel Aviv with his little pug dog

205
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,840
named Powley.

206
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,480
And Powley did his business

207
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,280
on the sidewalk.

208
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,760
Oded was not paying attention,

209
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,160
didn't clean up after the dog.

210
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,440
Received a fine from a police officer

211
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,880
who saw him walking on his dog.

212
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,040
And then him being these

213
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,100
sort of quintessential

214
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,994
fiery tempered entrepreneur.

215
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:07,960
Rather than paying a fine

216
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,880
and moving on with his life,

217
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,320
decided that he was going to come up

218
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,200
with a new 21st century solution

219
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,200
to clean up after dogs.

220
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,920
So, of course, some Israeli

221
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,200
entrepreneur is going to do this.

222
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,200
So then they started working

223
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:19,920
with the Gates Foundation

224
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,240
designing toilets.

225
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,320
They were then presenting

226
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,760
at a conference here in California

227
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,440
where me and my father

228
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,160
were in the audience.

229
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,320
My father is an engineer.

230
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,200
Originally an engineer in

231
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,160
Soviet space program before he came here.

232
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,170
Wow.

233
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,240
He now designs building systems,

234
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,080
mechanical systems,

235
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,520
electrical systems, plumbing systems.

236
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,280
We said, can we take  what we were doing

237
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,960
with one toilet with the Gates Foundation

238
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,480
put it into an entire building.

239
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,120
And so what we do is, as I said,

240
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,440
normally a building big 40 storey high rise

241
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,160
in downtown LA, San Francisco,

242
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,050
Boston and Tel Aviv,

243
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,200
Everything all of the dirty water

244
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,680
goes from the building that into the sewer.

245
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,560
What we do is we install our system

246
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,120
into the basement of that building.

247
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,120
We do two things.

248
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,400
One is we pull all of the solids

249
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,480
out of the water.

250
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,040
All of the organic solids.

251
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,640
Things that we eat and go out of our body,

252
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,040
and we turn those into fertilizer.

253
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,280
So this is really amazing

254
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,600
Carbon rich fertilizer we've

255
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,880
been using in around cities.

256
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,280
The water we then treat

257
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,400
and put back into the buildings.

258
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,040
We actually help buildings reduce their

259
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,920
water needs by [--]

260
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,680
And I saw your face.

261
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,880
That's what we called the industry

262
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,320
the yuck factor that people are

263
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,520
uncomfortable with this idea.

264
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,160
So, one important thing is that right now

265
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,360
we only reuse water for non drinking.

266
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,080
So, for example for toilet flushing.

267
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,640
Oh, yeah.

268
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,320
I was assuming that you're also

269
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,480
trying to make it into a drinkable water?

270
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,360
On venture side,

271
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,040
scientifically, we can produce

272
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,240
any kind of water we want.

273
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,840
But by regulation

274
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,120
and as the reaction of you

275
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,920
and other people,

276
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,200
a lot of people like you,

277
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,280
now we're focused on just reusing water

278
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,920
for things, like I said,

279
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,720
toilet flushing, cooling towers,

280
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,280
which by the way, most of the water

281
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,920
in buildings is for that anyways.

282
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,120
So, obviously I'm making these faces,

283
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,560
but it is solving a huge, huge issue.

284
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,080
And I mean, the lack of accessibility

285
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,240
to drinkable water,

286
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,160
let alone, you know,

287
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,680
water for the toilets

288
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,680
is a huge problem.

289
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,160
And if you're able to to design buildings

290
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,560
that are allowing for that to happen.

291
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,480
By the way, how much potential

292
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,000
could be recycled from the water

293
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,840
that we use, let's say, on the average flush

294
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,920
from a number one or number two?

295
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,560
So, on average, with all the water

296
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,920
that a building produces,

297
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,640
all the dirty water that they create,

298
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,720
we can reuse anywhere

299
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,120
from 40 to 90% of it.

300
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,440
40 to 90%.

301
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,160
Which basically means that,

302
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,880
So, about like if we use

303
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,640
if we look at the consumption over a week,

304
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,440
we can basically narrow it down

305
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
to the consumption of two days

306
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,360
out of the week.

307
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,000
And that will give us the whole runway.

308
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,400
And then, what is that

309
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,080
gonna do to the world?

310
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,760
So let's look at the vision further ahead.

311
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,040
Let's say you were able to

312
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,840
implement this in every building

313
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,400
in New York

314
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,960
and every building in SF.

315
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,400
What impact?

316
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,280
And how does this then later on

317
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,880
impact the developing areas?

318
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,760
Or are you not concerned with that yet?

319
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,160
No, we absolutely are.

320
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,720
This is the solution that we're starting

321
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,680
in downtown San Francisco.

322
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,560
Because there's a lot of regulations

323
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,200
and incentives for it.

324
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,240
And it just goes kind of

325
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,680
the start of what will people,

326
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,280
We think is sort of gonna be

327
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,600
a revolution in how cities are designed.

328
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,040
In terms of their urban wastewater.

329
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,440
But a helpful analogy of how

330
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,840
to think about all of this.

331
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,880
It is decentralization.

332
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,480
So, you can look at a lot of different

333
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,640
industries that have moved away

334
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,720
from big centralized infrastructure

335
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,640
to decentralized.

336
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,200
So, one really good example

337
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,680
is telecommunications.

338
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,040
It used to be we used any poles

339
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,800
and wires to connect everything.

340
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,760
And then with the advent of cell phones,

341
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,560
everything became decentralized.

342
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,240
You look at the energy industry

343
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:41,600
where it we use to only be

344
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,400
focused on big plants,

345
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,520
coal plants, nuclear plants.

346
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,160
And then we started decentralizing.

347
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,640
We started creating wind farms.

348
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,440
And we started putting

349
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,320
solar panels on people's roofs.

350
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,000
We're doing that same decentralization.

351
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,040
But for the water wastewater world,

352
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,640
we're just about 15 years

353
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,880
behind the energy guys.

354
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,200
But that's exactly,

355
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,760
the way to think of what we're doing

356
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,960
is exactly what they did.

357
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,680
We're just doing it for

358
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,720
a completely different industry.

359
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,760
Right. And how do you get the water back up?

360
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,160
So if I'm on this on the second floor,

361
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,920
does a recycled water maintain on my floor?

362
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,320
Or is there a whole system that

363
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,440
transitions it throughout the building?

364
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,840
Yeah. So, the good thing is that pumps,

365
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,040
we don't even have to invent those.

366
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,400
We just use pumps that we can put

367
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,080
the water up however high we need.

368
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,120
So, we're talking now to

369
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,120
one projects in San Francisco.

370
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,280
That's 55 stories.

371
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,960
We're talking to one project in Seattle.

372
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,920
That's 90 stories.

373
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,040
So, we can get the water

374
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,200
wherever we need to get it.

375
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,840
Incredible. And does that require

376
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,000
the buildings to be

377
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,400
planned in advance for this?

378
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,320
Or can you also go into existing buildings

379
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,200
and make those modifications?

380
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,160
So, our focus is on new construction

381
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,960
Because it just makes sense.

382
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:47,970
Because we can do designing for that.

383
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,920
But in certain cases,

384
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,680
we actually can do retrofits.

385
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,960
And in fact, in September of 2019,

386
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,080
we did a retrofit into a 35 storey

387
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,000
high rise in San Francisco

388
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,880
called the Nema Building.

389
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,560
Which is right between

390
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,600
the Twitter headquarters

391
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
and the Uber headquarters.

392
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,400
That's our first deployment.

393
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
And that was a retrofit.

394
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,680
And I'll tell you

395
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,000
what it is a retrofit.

396
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
That means that those people

397
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,680
in this case,

398
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,400
so, it's 754 fully occupied apartments.

399
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,240
Which means we started

400
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,320
making adjustments to the pipes.

401
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:17,160
In the industry

402
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,760
we call that a hot tap.

403
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,640
Which means no matter what,

404
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,680
there's going to be stuff

405
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,640
coming through those pipes.

406
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,760
So we went in at three AM.

407
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,680
Which when we thought

408
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,680
there'd be the least amount

409
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,320
of flushes in that building.

410
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,640
And we kind of sat there

411
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,200
we're all that nervous

412
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
as we went up on a ladder

413
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,440
or an elevator ladder about 20 feet.

414
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,120
Removed a section of pipe.

415
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,160
Moves really quickly

416
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,800
and kind of were holding our breath.

417
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,360
And guess what?

418
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,280
No flushes.

419
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,000
We got away

420
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,400
without any single flushes

421
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,400
coming on us.

422
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:46,920
Which by the way,

423
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,880
when you worked in this industry.

424
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,160
You do what I do.

425
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,640
You know, sometimes I'm not

426
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,080
neatly dressed wearing a suit.

427
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,600
A lot of times we're getting

428
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,720
pretty, pretty dirty.

429
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,920
But that's what we gotta do.

430
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,680
That's what we gotta do

431
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,360
to try and build something different

432
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,480
and knew you've got to get dirty.

433
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,000
And that's an analogy.

434
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,040
I think it's a metaphor not just for us,

435
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,360
but for every new project.

436
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
Or every new venture.

437
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,360
Right. So, I mean,

438
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,800
what where does this headed?

439
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,040
So, give me sort of like, you know,

440
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,720
you're as a CEO and founder,

441
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,040
What is your timeline and

442
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,920
envisioning ahead?

443
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,720
What are the different

444
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,800
markets you're going after?

445
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,480
And when can we expect this to be sort

446
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,480
of a mainstream thing?

447
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,760
Where the average person realizes

448
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,080
that the water that they're using

449
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,000
in their toilet,

450
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,360
or in their water fountains,

451
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,280
for brushing their teeth,

452
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,720
is actually recycled water

453
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,680
from the building.

454
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,240
Yeah. Look you know, it's as I said,

455
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,480
it's starting in San Francisco.

456
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,400
So, we actually,

457
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,200
part of the benefit

458
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,240
of coming from politics

459
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,200
is we actually helped work

460
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
with a number of people

461
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,120
to make San Francisco

462
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,120
the first city in the entire country

463
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,600
to require that all new large buildings

464
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,000
have to have onsite

465
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,080
water recycling system.

466
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,280
Oh really.

467
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,720
similar legislation in California.

468
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,840
And by the way, look, you know,

469
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,680
we as a country in the United States,

470
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,160
we recycle maybe two or 3%

471
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,480
of all of the wastewater we produce.

472
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,360
You look at a country like Spain,

473
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,480
they're number two in the world

474
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,640
at around 34 to 35%.

475
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,720
Israel is closer to 90%.

476
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,760
So Israel basically sets the bar

477
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,600
for what we,

478
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,800
how we should be thinking about water.

479
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,200
Israel recycles 90% of its water?

480
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,440
It recycles 90% all of its wastewater

481
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,640
that they produce. Yeah.

482
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,000
Oh, my. Oh, I had no idea. Wow.

483
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,520
Yeah.

484
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,520
Israel is a world leader

485
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,840
when it comes to water

486
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,720
and water innovation.

487
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,800
I mean, it kind of makes sense.

488
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,080
We have to have water in the desert

489
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,720
and we only have this tiny Kinneret.

490
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,160
Which one year is grade one.

491
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,400
New year it's a dried up.

492
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,040
So, we really can't take

493
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,720
too many risks.

494
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,120
I mean, did you think you would get

495
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,360
into this business?

496
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,600
You know, as you in AIPAC,

497
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,240
I mean, as you're going through your life.

498
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,640
Did you realize that  you wanted

499
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,800
to build a company that does,

500
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,240
that's such a major impact,

501
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,080
and a big social impact, actually?

502
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,280
I know ever since I was young,

503
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,680
I always knew that I wanted

504
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,800
to be involved in things,

505
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,280
that we're having a very

506
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,600
positive impact on the world.

507
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,520
Yeah.

508
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,120
I didn't know what that looked like yet.

509
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,880
Some people know from day one,

510
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,960
I want to be a doctor.

511
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,880
I want to be a pilot.

512
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,480
I want to do this.

513
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:10,490
I want to to that.

514
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,000
I didn't know what the hell I want to do.

515
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,360
I thought I was gonna go to law school.

516
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,320
I thought I was gonna try this.

517
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,720
At one point, I wanted to be a chef.

518
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,240
I wanted to be vegetarian.

519
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,320
But what I knew

520
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,800
sort of the one guiding light for me

521
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,160
was that I wanted to do something

522
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,520
that was gonna have a big impact on the world.

523
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
And frankly, I couldn't see myself

524
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,840
doing anything that wasn't

525
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,120
sort of impact focused.

526
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,440
And so for me,

527
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,840
I didn't know much about water.

528
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,280
I don't know much about the environment.

529
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,640
I don't know much about climate change

530
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,400
or all these big sort of sustainability issues.

531
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,520
But I knew that I could learn.

532
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
I'm a quick learner.

533
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,280
And I knew that if I was doing something

534
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,960
that I cared about,

535
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,520
I would be able to add in all

536
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,440
the other important stuff.

537
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,960
I would be able to add in the technical

538
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,920
skills and everything else.

539
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,880
And that's what happened with Epic.

540
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,400
Before we officially farmed out big.

541
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,920
I spent about six months

542
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,360
just talking to everyone

543
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,360
that he had not even sort

544
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,880
of a very basic connection

545
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,560
to what we were doing.

546
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,600
I spoke with building developers,

547
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,880
architects, engineers.

548
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,000
I spoke with scientists.

549
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,280
I spoke with professors.

550
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,800
I went to farmer's markets

551
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,000
and went up to the people and said,

552
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,100
"Hey, would you use treated

553
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,400
human waste on your crops?"

554
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,320
And I just talked to everyone

555
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,120
to just find out what are the problems?

556
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
What are the red flags?

557
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,800
What are the things that

558
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,960
we should be looking out for?

559
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,960
And we just learned.

560
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,840
We just learned.

561
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,600
And, you know, there's an element of

562
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,480
we got lucky that five years ago,

563
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,400
if you ask someone,

564
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,320
"Can we recycle waste water on buildings?"

565
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,520
They would say, "I don't know."

566
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,040
And now we have laws in the books

567
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,640
in San Francisco and in California

568
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,000
that make it possible.

569
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,880
So, you know, I think

570
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,200
to me, when I talk to other sort of people

571
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,320
thinking about going into starting ventures

572
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,520
and becoming entrepreneurs,

573
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,600
you don't need to know all the answers.

574
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,000
You just need to be someone who's

575
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,560
comfortable with the fact

576
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,400
that you're not going to know

577
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,040
all the answers one time.

578
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,680
And how many other players

579
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,920
are in this market right now

580
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,640
that are sort of working on

581
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,880
similar problems like you are?

582
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,800
When it comes to our competitive landscape,

583
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,840
I can name all of those people

584
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,920
on one hand.

585
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,720
Wow. Okay.

586
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
So, definitely, I mean,

587
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,400
when you get to a point where a nation

588
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,440
or a large city decided that it's important enough

589
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,920
to make a law out of this.

590
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,240
And for any new construction.

591
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,600
And you're only one of a few that are

592
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,120
able to do this, I think.

593
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,520
I think you're in a pretty good position.

594
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,000
Aaron, what other things

595
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,280
around the world

596
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,600
now that you're,

597
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,240
you have experience in looking at these

598
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,680
different day to day things that we might

599
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,320
take for granted.

600
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,280
I never even thought about the water

601
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,280
that we're wasting through our toilet system.

602
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,720
What other things can we be hopeful

603
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,240
looking forward that we can

604
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,760
revolutionize and make

605
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,160
a positive impact on the world?

606
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,640
Look, I'll tell you one thing

607
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,840
I'm excited about is that,

608
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,040
before I started Epic,

609
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,160
I ran a business development marketing

610
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,840
for a large engineering company.

611
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,160
My father's company.

612
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,680
And one of the things that I did

613
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,320
was I ran the internship program.

614
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,120
Which means I reviewed

615
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,400
every single application that came in.

616
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,440
And I'll tell you the one

617
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,000
almost every single application.

618
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,520
One thing in common is that

619
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,280
they wanted to be part of a company

620
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,400
that was focused on sustainable design.

621
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,960
That was focused on creating healthier,

622
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,040
greener and more sustainable buildings.

623
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,160
And so, when I look at that,

624
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,520
that to me tells me that

625
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,720
there's a whole new generation

626
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,840
of engineers who, frankly,

627
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,680
build the world that are focused

628
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,120
not just on building things.

629
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,720
But on building things better

630
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,440
and creating a better future.

631
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,560
So, when I look at that,

632
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,800
I'm not just looking at my industry.

633
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm looking at every single industry.

634
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,440
And this new wave of the top engineers

635
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,320
who this is how they're being

636
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,800
trained and this is how they think.

637
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,120
I'm really optimistic.

638
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,200
You know, I think when people you know,

639
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,320
when you think about something

640
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,800
like climate change,

641
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,120
you know, people kind of always

642
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,400
want to find what's the solution.

643
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,360
Where should we be investing

644
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,160
billions of dollars?

645
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,840
And you know, what I believe is

646
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,560
there is no one silver bullet.

647
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,800
But instead, we need to use

648
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,040
what we call silver buckshot.

649
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,440
We need to do a ton of different solutions

650
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,120
all at the same time.

651
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,040
And that's a quote, by the way,

652
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,400
borrowed from Bill McKibben,

653
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,560
who's a very well-known climate activist.

654
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,160
And, you know, I think really,

655
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,400
as I mentioned, when we only recycle

656
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,000
3% of the wastewater in this country,

657
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,760
that means we have a long way to innovate.

658
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,920
And which means it's exciting.

659
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,240
There's so many different things we can do.

660
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,160
That's what keeps us excited that I think.

661
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,000
Definitely.

662
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,920
And is the business of doing something

663
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,880
like Epic clean tech,

664
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,800
You know I'm coming from a much more

665
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,240
science oriented place.

666
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,080
And I'm thinking immediately.

667
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,240
Okay, I see you raise your seed,

668
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,240
and then you build your MVP, and then

669
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,560
you raise a huge institutional around.

670
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,560
And you grow it and you scale it up.

671
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,560
Is that a similar model to running

672
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,520
a startup in the space that you're at?

673
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,400
Or is it much more incremental

674
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,920
and less of a hockey stick trajectory?

675
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,680
Yeah. So, I look at,

676
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,920
the basic similarities are there.

677
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,520
You need grit.

678
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,840
You need to be able to deal with failure

679
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,160
on many different fronts.

680
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,040
Both with the product

681
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,720
as well as you're

682
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,080
talking investors and customers.

683
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,320
But it is a different timeline for sure.

684
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,040
Because the whole move

685
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,720
to break things and move fast,

686
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,520
that whole methodology.

687
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,400
It's not necessarily translatable

688
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,480
to when you're dealing with something

689
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,400
like water where public health is

690
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,200
You know, that there's the

691
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,040
if you mess up,

692
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,200
you're going to kill someone.

693
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,880
Or you're going to get someone sick.

694
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,320
So we can't take quite the same risks.

695
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,640
Plus, we're working in one

696
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,040
of the most highly regulated

697
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,800
and oldest industries out there.

698
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,520
Whereas software is still

699
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,960
in many ways it's still the Wild West

700
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,280
where we're reinventing new things

701
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,120
and thinking of new things.

702
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,520
And software is eating the world, right?

703
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,080
It's nobody.

704
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,560
It's a different approach.

705
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,960
And in many cases,

706
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
we're more similar to kind of

707
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,840
the Uber model of regulatory hacking.

708
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,920
Where it's not just new technology,

709
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,200
but you have to figure out how to work

710
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,800
with an existing power structures

711
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,040
of cities and with industries.

712
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,840
And Uber stays with transportation,

713
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,160
which you only have to read about

714
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,520
the stories about the taxi unions.

715
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,680
And that whole industry

716
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,200
was very against this.

717
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,840
And by the way, take it back even further.

718
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,280
You know, when the first trolley cars

719
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,240
came to San Francisco,

720
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,200
you know who fought them?

721
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,210
Who?

722
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,280
All the guys who drove the horse

723
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,720
and buggy riders and 12 guys.

724
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,520
Well, these trolley cars are

725
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,600
going to put us out of business.

726
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,680
This is what happens.

727
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,600
Every single generation finds

728
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,800
the new innovation that's going

729
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,520
to put them out of business.

730
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,040
And but for us, it's different.

731
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,440
Because we're not going to put water

732
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,000
in wastewater plants out of business.

733
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,760
We're actually finding

734
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
a way to work with them.

735
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,400
So, we work really closely

736
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
with the utility here in San Francisco.

737
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,800
So, you know, the short answer is

738
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,040
our stuff is more expensive.

739
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,200
So, it's and it's a big physical heavy

740
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,040
we're talking about thousand pounds

741
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,040
of metalled steel and wires.

742
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,320
And so, it's different.

743
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,400
We don't iterate as quickly.

744
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,640
But all of the basic framework

745
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,960
of how to build something new is there.

746
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,680
Which is that you're gonna find our position.

747
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,840
You're gonna have to get in,

748
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,560
in our case, literally very dirty.

749
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,240
But the basic tool kit is the same.

750
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:42,840
I love it. Aaron, right before we leave,

751
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,520
I have to ask you

752
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,720
the most important question.

753
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,760
Three words that best describe you.

754
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,200
I'm going to flip it and I'm going to say

755
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,000
three words that my mom would use

756
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,000
to describe me.

757
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:59,890
That is Number One Son.

758
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,960
And I'm saying that just in case either

759
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,160
my older brothers out emerged

760
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,320
or Joseph are listening,

761
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,960
that I now put on the public record

762
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,160
that I'm most favorite son.

763
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,120
So there you go.

764
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,120
I love it. Number one son.

765
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,000
I love it.

766
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,680
Aaron, thank you very much.

767
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:13,690
Toda raba.

768
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,920
And I mean, it just sounds incredible.

769
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,760
I can't wait to move into

770
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,800
a building that has this.

771
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,280
And I can proudly say that

772
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,960
I know one of the pioneers of this

773
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,800
Who are making a positive impact

774
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,560
on the world.

775
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,240
And it's really fascinating.

776
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:27,680
Thank you.

777
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,160
You ever want to tour?

778
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,160
You let me know.

779
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,920
I just need a couple of extra clothes to

780
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,760
take with me, and I'm happy to join in.

781
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,920
We got that. Don't worry.

782
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:36,930
Toda raba.

783
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,760
Thank you very much.

784
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,640
Have a great rest of the day.

785
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,640
Bye bye.

786
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,800
