1
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:16,799
Larry Diamond, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

2
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,399
Really great to have you.

3
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,066
Thank you Michael, it's great to be with you.

4
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,799
Wonderful. Okay.

5
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,632
Larry, a Senior Fellow at Hoover Institute.

6
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:28,499
Senior Fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute at Stanford University

7
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,632
Beautiful background behind you.

8
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:33,299
We've known each other for quite some time now.

9
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:38,732
Most prominently, through the incredible class, the Spirit of Democracy

10
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:41,699
that you taught me in the beginning of the year

11
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,999
which gave me a ten-week deep dive into what is democracy,

12
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,732
what is the amazing work that you've been doing there with your colleagues,

13
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:54,532
and I can't wait for this 20 minutes to talk about democracy

14
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:57,499
and where we're headed as a world.

15
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,532
So, maybe just give me a little bit of brief down of who are you

16
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:04,566
and why are you even interested in democracy?

17
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:10,099
Well, I'm a Senior Fellow at the institution over my shoulder, the Hoover Institution,

18
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:15,066
on World Revolution and Peace and at the Freeman Spogli Institute.

19
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:19,999
I'm a Professor by courtesy of Political Science in Sociology at Stanford,

20
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,299
and I co-edit the journal of democracy

21
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,566
and obviously I care about democracy.

22
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:29,199
I believe in freedom and individual dignity.

23
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,766
And I have always believed from a philosophical standpoint

24
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:43,866
but now I know, after 40 years of study from a scholarly standpoint

25
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:49,232
that Liberal Democracy is the best way, and I believe the only way

26
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:51,866
to fully ensure a human dignity.

27
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:56,832
Okay. So, you're saying I heard freedom, I heard human dignity, and then liberal democracy.

28
00:09:56,833 --> 00:10:02,666
Why is there the word "liberal" in front of the word democracy?

29
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:09,099
Well, you had earlier hoped that I would define democracy, so let me do it in this way.

30
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,132
A democracy is a system of government in which people can choose their leaders

31
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:16,366
and replace their leaders in free and fair elections.

32
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:20,532
If you don't have that, you can't get real political accountability.

33
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:25,032
Maybe you can pressure semi-authoritarian regime

34
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:31,266
but without the ability to remove leaders who mis perform

35
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:41,532
and put a competing policy options to the citizenry in regular free and fair elections

36
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:51,966
you can't ensure political accountability and you are very likely to slide rapidly down the path

37
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:55,732
of tyranny and abusive power and abuse of human rights.

38
00:10:55,733 --> 00:11:04,032
At the same time, the political dimension of competition and accountability

39
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:09,599
through the, let's be honest, fairly crude and limited instrument,

40
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,232
indispensable though it is, of regular free and fair elections is not enough.

41
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:19,332
And the liberal dimension is everything else.

42
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:26,699
It's ensuring that you have very extensive rights of speech, press, association.

43
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:32,832
That you have a strong rule of law in which the courts are fully independent.

44
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:40,266
That you have a strong constitutional order that will defend human dignity

45
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:45,499
and provide at least means to correct the kinds of abuses of human rights

46
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,932
that we're now seeing in too many American cities,

47
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:53,532
targeted against African-Americans in particular.

48
00:11:53,533 --> 00:12:02,532
And that, you know you can at least pursue the goal, difficult though it is to achieve

49
00:12:02,533 --> 00:12:08,499
of social, economic, and political equality.

50
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,399
And some reasonable degree of justice.

51
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,766
Right. So, a big part of it is the peoples' wish, right?

52
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:21,066
The peoples vote and the human dignity.

53
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:26,366
And a huge part of that is information. It’s the dissemination of information.

54
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:30,332
If we look 20, 30 years ago, there was one or two channels

55
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,366
in which the information was disseminated.

56
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:35,532
Pretty accountable in a lot of areas in the world.

57
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:37,899
Is that information accurate or not?

58
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:43,332
Now, every kid with a Tiktok account, or an Instagram or a Facebook,

59
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,499
Those are news channels.

60
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,532
They're no longer social media channels.

61
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:51,932
To me, they're news channels because I consider myself an educated being.

62
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:55,799
I'm all about democracy and I'm all about information.

63
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,299
I get so much of my news from my social media feeds even without knowing it.

64
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,566
Just because it's there.

65
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:07,232
So, what are some of the biggest challenges that you've seen over the past 40 years

66
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:11,466
going forward with how do we deal with this information around the world.

67
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:14,232
You know, especially considering the 2016 elections,

68
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:18,332
the upcoming election, and so on.

69
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:24,666
Well, there's the eternal challenge of ensuring freedom of information.

70
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:27,032
And the plurality of information.

71
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:30,899
It's not just the people who have access to information.

72
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:35,199
There needs to be the freedom to gather report,

73
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:42,599
convey, distill, and opinionate in terms of information.

74
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:48,999
And I say it's an eternal challenge because once again we're seeing a war

75
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,332
on independent media, often a deadly one,

76
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,432
by Autocrats around the world who don't want to be held accountable,

77
00:13:56,433 --> 00:14:00,866
don't want to have their corruption, abuse of power exposed.

78
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:05,732
I believe there was just a prime minister who almost tried to get a journalist into jail.

79
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:08,966
In a specific country that I'm related with.

80
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:18,566
Well, you know Israel is not even close to being the worst offender

81
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:25,599
even among so-called democracies, not to mention all the other countries of the Middle East.

82
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,399
But we're seeing pressure on the independent media

83
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,032
even in the countries that have been considered liberal democracies.

84
00:14:32,033 --> 00:14:36,699
And I'm sorry to say that now we have a President of the United States

85
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,666
who has contempt for independent media.

86
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:44,199
Has called them "purveyors of fake news and enemies of the people"

87
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:51,099
And this gives ... comfort and encouragement to autocrats around the world

88
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:56,499
who want to subdue and completely control independent media.

89
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,532
What is your reaction to this

90
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:02,432
and political scientist like yourself who are watching

91
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:05,366
as you know, the leader of the free world

92
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:08,666
is perhaps moving, steering very rapidly away from

93
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:12,432
the so-called liberal democracy which we're aiming for.

94
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:26,499
Well, I have been ever since his illiberal and populist election campaign in 2015 and 2016.

95
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:32,366
And in particular, since he assumed the presidency and began to bring

96
00:15:32,367 --> 00:15:39,466
these themes of disinformation, intolerance, contempt for opposition,

97
00:15:39,467 --> 00:15:45,266
contempt for independent institutions and independent media in to the Whitehouse

98
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:53,166
I have been increasingly disturbed, angered, and horrified by what he's been doing.

99
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:57,399
I think increasingly it represents a danger,

100
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,032
not only to our democratic values but to our institutions

101
00:16:01,033 --> 00:16:08,299
which you see in the way he's been running rough shot over separation of powers.

102
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,466
Misusing the military. Misusing the justice department.

103
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:20,732
Dividing the country. Firing inspectors, general, and anyone who would try to hold him

104
00:16:20,733 --> 00:16:24,266
and his administration to account.

105
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:30,866
So, I think civil society here and elsewhere needs to stand up to this.

106
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:38,066
And people from across the political spectrum need to rally behind common principles,

107
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:44,932
bedrock minimum principles of not just democracy but liberal democracy

108
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:51,632
which include tolerance, pluralism, respect for the independence of the media civil society

109
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:55,699
and accountability institutions, and a rule of law.

110
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:01,232
But Michael, I did not want to neglect the other half of your question

111
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:06,366
which revolves around the new era we are in social media

112
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:15,499
and that challenge is fresh because before we thought it was enough to just have independent media.

113
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:23,432
They would constitute an arena of pluralism of information

114
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:26,399
and contestation of ideas.

115
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:33,466
Maybe there would be some irresponsibility and sensationalism in the midst of it,

116
00:17:33,467 --> 00:17:36,832
but people would kind of ferret it out.

117
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:45,399
In the era of social media, with the extraordinary precision and power of targeting

118
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:53,499
micro targeting - it's unbelievable -  and the algorithms that the social media platforms generate to do this

119
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:59,499
and the anonymity of many of the purveyors of this information

120
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,432
or what we saw in the 2016 election campaign, the deliberate disguising

121
00:18:03,433 --> 00:18:06,999
of the sources of this disinformation.

122
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,666
We're really in a new and much more dangerous era.

123
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:16,032
So, okay. I mean, it's sad to think that. But I'm now thinking ahead.

124
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:21,532
Ok, so, I'm in the realm of the millennial generation or generation Z and Y,

125
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:22,699
What is our responsibility here?

126
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,566
Because honestly, I think that most of the people that I'm around.

127
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:29,432
We can all vouch for democracy. We don't really know what democracy is.

128
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:32,932
I'm very fortunate to have been in your class and to have listened to you passionately

129
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:37,232
explain to us also the amazing work that I would love to get to the American in One Room.

130
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:41,399
Work that you've done. But what is our responsibility now

131
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,299
as educated young adult who are entering the work force

132
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,266
and except for the active voting, the once every four years.

133
00:18:50,267 --> 00:18:54,132
What do we need to do in order to ensure that we're moving in the right direction?

134
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:58,932
Because it sounds like this is now a nationwide reunite.

135
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:02,666
It's no longer does the politicians that have to work it out amongst themselves.

136
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:07,666
Let me first come to the information and then I'll come to the action.

137
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:12,599
We all need to be better educated and better informed.

138
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,132
And to be well informed, to be intelligently informed,

139
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:21,899
and I'd say to be responsibly informed in a democracy,

140
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,632
we can't be passively informed. And by passively, I mean,

141
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:36,799
allow the main or principal, or only sources of our information to be what is conveyed to us

142
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:45,499
increasingly, I repeat, through micro-targeting in algorithmic formulas

143
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,866
that constrain what we're getting.

144
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:53,599
And give us what they think is going to entertain or outraged us

145
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,866
but fixate our attention on their website.

146
00:19:56,867 --> 00:20:03,099
And so we need to be proactive to seek out multiple sources of informationa

147
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:08,532
and to you know check and verify the information we're getting

148
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:13,166
which means getting on others' engaging and creative

149
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:19,432
and intensive information searches to check out assertions

150
00:20:19,433 --> 00:20:25,599
and try to asses and validate the authenticity and credibility

151
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,866
of some of the claims that are being made before we retweet them, repeat them,

152
00:20:31,867 --> 00:20:35,499
or post them on our various social media sites.

153
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,266
Is that feasible to ask of a 20-year old to check their sources? Yes, it is.

154
00:20:40,267 --> 00:20:45,066
I think we can ask it of a 15-year old.

155
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:51,666
And if you doubt me, please interview my colleague in the school of education Sam Weintraub

156
00:20:51,667 --> 00:21:08,732
who has been working to develop protocols and educational tools for - Sam Wineburg

157
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:15,266
excuse me - develop educational tools for young people to learn

158
00:21:15,267 --> 00:21:21,399
how to confirm, or asses, or validate the claims they're seeing on the internet

159
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:27,366
and not just swallow them wholesale and therefor become at least unwitting

160
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:31,666
purveyors of misinformation.

161
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:34,532
But in addition on the action side, Michael,

162
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:40,032
don't dismiss the importance of that voting once every four years.

163
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:47,599
It's the last line of defense for political accountability, good governance,

164
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,132
and you know, the protection of civil liberties.

165
00:21:52,133 --> 00:22:01,632
But in addition, we've seen in the last two weeks, since the murder of George Floyd

166
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:07,899
in Minneapolis, that civil society action, peaceful non-violent discipline

167
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,532
coordinated in passioned civil society action can make a difference

168
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:15,266
and can bring about social change.

169
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:18,566
We saw it in the civil rights movement in the United States.

170
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:25,032
We saw it with the women’s suffragist movement in the United States.

171
00:22:25,033 --> 00:22:29,632
We saw it with the anti-war movement in the United States.

172
00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:34,099
And I think we are entering a period of profound, creative,

173
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,399
renewing social and political reform in the United States.

174
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,199
That gives me a lot of optimism. And Larry, one of the main themes

175
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,299
that we were discussing in our sessions was this idea of polarization

176
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:53,266
and how do we bring people together of polarized opinions into the same room

177
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:58,332
and to be able to have educated discussions and to really listen

178
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,632
and not just to be present.

179
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:03,466
And you ran a fascinating experiment you can call it,

180
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:06,832
or, I think it's much greater than just and experiment.

181
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,699
The word experiment doesn't give justice to the amazing work

182
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,832
that you and Professor Fishkin did.

183
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:17,932
America in One Room. Bringing together people from all different sides.

184
00:23:17,933 --> 00:23:20,366
Talk to me about that. What was that about?

185
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:26,499
Well, I was privileged to be part of a very imaginative and far-reaching exercise

186
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:32,099
in Dallas, Texas last year led by my colleague James Fishkin,

187
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,466
Department of Communication at Stanford,

188
00:23:36,467 --> 00:23:44,466
to bring 526 randomly selected Americans of all ethnicities, and parties,

189
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:51,332
and ideological persuasions, and diverse places in the United States together

190
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:59,299
for much of four days to deliberate on some of the major issues facing the United States

191
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:05,732
in terms of healthcare, the economy, immigration, environment, and foreign policy.

192
00:24:05,733 --> 00:24:10,766
And this was another iteration of the model, the deliberative polling

193
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:15,432
that James Fishkin has developed and applied over a hundred times

194
00:24:15,433 --> 00:24:18,099
in more than a dozen countries.

195
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:23,132
And what we found is what a gem and his deputy director Alice Siu,

196
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:24,966
of the Center for Deliberative for Democracy

197
00:24:24,967 --> 00:24:27,999
and others have found when they've done these things

198
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,166
that when you bring people together, under good conditions

199
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:38,899
where they have access to well researched and balanced issue briefing papers

200
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,766
and where they can hear different points of view,

201
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:48,266
in plenary sessions on the issues, and where they can interact and talk about the issues

202
00:24:48,267 --> 00:24:52,866
respectfully in small groups with people that come from different places

203
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:58,732
and may have different opinions, their opinions changed.

204
00:24:58,733 --> 00:25:05,166
And we found generally, on a lot of issues, not all but on a striking number of issues,

205
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:11,466
that people, that polarization reduced on the issues.
Pretty dramatic.

206
00:25:11,467 --> 00:25:16,032
It there was change the change was toward less polarization.

207
00:25:16,033 --> 00:25:22,199
With republicans and democrats, progressives and conservatives coming together

208
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,632
either by moving more toward one position than the other

209
00:25:25,633 --> 00:25:30,732
or moving towards some you know, kind of creative common ground.

210
00:25:30,733 --> 00:25:37,232
And not least Michael, in importance, when people got to know one another

211
00:25:37,233 --> 00:25:40,266
we had people who said, "You know, I've never--"

212
00:25:40,267 --> 00:25:48,366
an African-American woman who said, "I’ve never interacted like this with a white person before."

213
00:25:48,367 --> 00:25:53,366
And vice-versa. Or white person from a rural area.

214
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:56,499
They see them as human beings.

215
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:02,599
An affect of polarization is emotional tribalism attenuates

216
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,099
and that's very important for the future of our democracy.

217
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,966
I think one of the most important questions from the survey afterwards

218
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:14,332
that I really resonated with was, it wasn't exactly that but it was around

219
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:18,699
How do you think the other side is willing to listen to you?

220
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,066
It was of that nature. That was a dramatic shift.

221
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:25,966
All of a sudden you see republicans who are shifting and saying,

222
00:26:25,967 --> 00:26:30,099
"Yeah. democrats are listening to us" Democrats are saying the same things about republicans.

223
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:35,066
And to me that was much more powerful than any shift on any topic.

224
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:39,699
It was about of this essence of are we willing to collaborate with the other side,

225
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,699
to acknowledge the differences

226
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,499
but acknowledge that at the end we're all citizens of this wonderful country,

227
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:49,266
of this wonderful world and we have a shared responsibility to reach a resolution

228
00:26:49,267 --> 00:26:51,666
and to better the lives of all the citizens.

229
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:54,066
I can't believe 20 minutes is almost up.

230
00:26:54,067 --> 00:26:57,532
I have to leave with the last question. It always sucks that it ends so quickly

231
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:00,699
and I only get a third of what I want to talk about.

232
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,832
But Larry, I would love to hear three words that you would describe yourself as

233
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:11,366
or if I would ask any of your students, how would they describe Larry Diamond as?

234
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:14,132
Well, you'll have to ask them,

235
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:19,499
but I would describe myself, first as a Democrat with a small D.

236
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:26,732
I believe deeply that liberal democracy is the best form of government

237
00:27:26,733 --> 00:27:31,266
and a pre-condition for achieving social justice to human dignity.

238
00:27:31,267 --> 00:27:37,999
I'm very proud of the coincidence that my parents left me unwittingly

239
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,466
that my initials Larry Diamond are the same initials as Liberal Democracy.

240
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:49,266
But secondly, I am a Reformer. I am an Activist.

241
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:54,432
I'm not a revolutionary but I do believe we need to struggle for change.

242
00:27:54,433 --> 00:28:00,032
And third, I think of myself as a scholar but most of all as a teacher

243
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:03,899
trying to convey these ideas both to my students

244
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,599
and a wider community of students around the world.

245
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,999
So, thank you for giving me an opportunity to do it here.

246
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,599
Larry, I wanna use this opportunity to thank you again for the incredible inspiration

247
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,899
that you've provided me personally and everybody else in my classes

248
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,432
and I'm sure that you teach in Stanford.

249
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:23,732
I'll never forget the very first session. It was Monday morning,

250
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:27,866
the first quarter of my freshman year, and I walk into the Spirit of Democracy class

251
00:28:27,867 --> 00:28:31,399
and you're standing in front of us talking about what the class will be about

252
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:37,532
and within about five or six minutes, you go down the path of the America in One Room

253
00:28:37,533 --> 00:28:41,399
and we see the passion in your eyes and I believe that you even started tearing up a little bit

254
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,799
and we looked at each other afterwards, and we said,

255
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,532
"Wow. So, this is where we came to."

256
00:28:46,533 --> 00:28:48,832
And so, I wanna thank you for that inspiration.

257
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:52,399
And I'll take that with me wherever I go.

258
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,799
And I look forward to maintaining this relationship over many many years.

259
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,666
Me too. Thank you, Michael.

260
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:40,967
Take care. Bye bye.
