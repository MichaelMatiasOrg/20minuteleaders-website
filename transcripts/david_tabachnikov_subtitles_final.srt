1
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,000
David Tabachnikov,
good to see you.

2
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,700
How are you?

3
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,700
I’m awesome. How are you?

4
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,700
Fantastic!
Thank you for being on the show.

5
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,700
You’re actually calling
from Serbia, right?

6
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,000
Yes. Thank you
for having me and

7
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,500
I'm in Belgrade.

8
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,700
Why Serbia?

9
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,700
Why Serbia? I actually,

10
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,700
to be fair,

11
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
Serbia is basically

12
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,700
has been my base after
I left Tel-Aviv in 2016.

13
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,700
And I’ve been a digital nomad
for quite a while.

14
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,700
A digital nomad?
What does that mean, digital nomad?

15
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,700
A digital nomad is
somebody who is basically

16
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,700
location independent,
somebody who doesn’t tie

17
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,700
his work or his activities
to a specific location

18
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,700
while doing his,

19
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,700
most cases,
doing his job digitally.

20
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:26,700
So, it can be the web developers,
marketing, teachers,

21
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,700
architects, anything -
- So anything

22
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,700
... laptop.

23
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,700
Anything that doesn’t require to
to use your hands

24
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,700
to assemble something.

25
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,700
Okay, I like that.

26
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,700
Yeah.

27
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,700
And you’re the CEO
of ScholarshipOwl,

28
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,700
and you’ve been doing
some pretty incredible work

29
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,700
to help a lot a lot of people
around the world

30
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,000
find scholarships
and get proper education.

31
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,700
So, tell me a little bit
about that and what is this

32
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,700
world of education?

33
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,700
Right.

34
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,700
I think you need
to move a little bit,

35
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,700
oh there you go
you’re back in focus.

36
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,700
Okay. Is this good?

37
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,700
Perfect.

38
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,700
... It’s becoming
a bit dark

39
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,700
because it’s 8 PM
for me, so

40
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,700
No ... this out, yeah.

41
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,700
So, tell me
what is ScholarshipOwl

42
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,000
and what is this thing about,

43
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,700
Why do we need
to even deal with this subject?

44
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,700
All right.
So, I’ll start with the

45
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,700
basically, the problem.
And the problem is that

46
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,700
in the US, specifically,

47
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,700
the education is
extremely expensive

48
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,700
And substantially more so
than in any other country.

49
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,000
In fact, in the past eight years,
the cost of tuition

50
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,700
has been going eight times
faster than the wages.

51
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,700
Wow!

52
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,700
- Okay.
- Yes.

53
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,700
Well how much are we
talking about tangibly here?

54
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,000
An average family pays per student

55
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,700
$26,000.

56
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,700
- Per year?
- That’s an average

57
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,700
per year, right.

58
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,700
I know cases of $70,000

59
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,700
and $90,000 as well.

60
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,700
Right.

61
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,700
So, numbers are huge.

62
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,700
To put it into a perspective,
a master’s degree in the UK

63
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,700
is kept by 9,000 pounds.

64
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:13,700
And that’s some of the most
expensive education in Europe.

65
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,700
Interesting. Okay.
So, why is that

66
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,700
So, why is that
though an issue?

67
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,700
So, yeah, we can say

68
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,000
you want to go
to a better university,

69
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,700
you’re gonna have
to pay more.

70
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,700
Are there not options
that are financially viable

71
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,700
for everybody?
Is that the issue?

72
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,700
So, there are all kinds
of government programs,

73
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,000
and there’s a subject
of student loans as well,

74
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,700
which has been talked a lot.

75
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,700
- Right, yeah.
- And student loans

76
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,700
is basically an attempt of the
government and private companies

77
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,700
to help students pay
those high tuition costs.

78
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,000
I believe, actually,
the student debt

79
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,700
is the second largest debt
in the US,

80
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,700
if not the most.
- It is. It is

81
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,700
No it's the second one.

82
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,000
It’s $1.7 trillion
and going by almost -

83
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Trillion dollars.

84
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,300
Trillion dollars, yeah.

85
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,700
That's a big market to go after, David.

86
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,700
It’s more than many
countries in the world.

87
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:10,700
And it’s been going
by around $100 billion a year

88
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,700
for the past five years.

89
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,700
- Crazy.
- It's crazy numbers.

90
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,700
It’s crazy numbers.

91
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,700
But the thing is that
the student loan industry,

92
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,700
in a way, it’s

93
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,700
it’s the one that drives

94
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,700
the tuition fee cost up
because the more loans

95
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,700
are available, the more money
the universities are taking

96
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,700
because they know
that the students can afford

97
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,700
to take more money in loans.

98
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,700
Interesting.

99
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,700
Okay, wait. So what you’re describing
here is this vicious cycle where

100
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,700
there’s more loan programs,

101
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,000
whether it’s by banks
or by government,

102
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,300
the universities see that,
and say, “Okay.

103
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,700
Well, actually now,
every kid on the block

104
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,700
can just go get a loan
from the bank.

105
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,300
Pay it over 30, 40 years.
So, why don’t we just raise

106
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,700
the tuition because
they can just get a bigger loan.

107
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,700
And now, we’re gonna" -
Yeah, but it’s just vicious, obviously.

108
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,700
Yeah, but you said it right,
every kid on the block.

109
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,700
So, basically, you’re telling
a 17-year-old kid,

110
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:11,000
“Now, take $100,000 in loan
that you will need to pay

111
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
with huge interest.”

112
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,700
We’re talking
like 8% to 14% interest.

113
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,700
It's huge interest.
Like, you have no,

114
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,700
no current history,
no other measurement of

115
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,700
how will you be able to repay it.
- That's right.

116
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,200
That's right.

117
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,300
So, how do you calculate
the interest?

118
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,700
And that’s how you end up with very,
very high interest

119
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,000
on that.
- Wow.

120
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,700
And you ask that
from a 17-year-old kid

121
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,000
like to make the decisions.

122
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Of course, he’s going to be
talking to his parents,

123
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,700
and so on.
But at the end of the day,

124
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,000
it’s very easy to be overwhelmed.
- But ... because

125
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,700
that kid needs an education

126
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,700
and if this is the only way
to get an education,

127
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,700
then it doesn’t matter
what the interest rate is.

128
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,700
Even if it’s 20%,
you have to do it,

129
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,700
otherwise you won’t even have
a chance here.

130
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,000
And let’s be honest,
most families do not have

131
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
$26,000

132
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,900
lying around to,

133
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,700
per year.

134
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,000
Most families don’t have $400
to pay in an emergency fund

135
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
if the car breaks down.
I heard that

136
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,800
in one of my economics classes.
I was shocked beyond belief.

137
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,000
Exactly. Exactly.

138
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,700
$400, most families don’t have
as emergency money.

139
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,700
I think

140
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,700
I just want to,

141
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,700
you said, like you know

142
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,700
We grew up in a considerably
more privileged world

143
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
than 4 billion people here

144
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,000
where we can go out
to restaurants.

145
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
We can eat.
We can go to university.

146
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,700
We can study and we’re engineers.

147
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,700
And I think, sometimes,
also for me, it’s hard to

148
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,000
it’s easy to forget
that a lot of others

149
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
don’t have these opportunities
and that’s why

150
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,700
I’m also so excited
about what you’re doing

151
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,000
with ScholarshipOwl
to level the playing field

152
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,700
and allow everybody there.

153
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,700
Exactly.

154
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,000
Now, student loans is one,

155
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,700
like you said,
it’s a vicious cycle.

156
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,700
A vicious cycle.

157
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:54,000
But part of the money, obviously,
comes from savings

158
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,700
that the parents have saved
beginning

159
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,700
the savings programs
from when the kid is born.

160
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,700
Part of that comes from
different types of scholarships.

161
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,700
And scholarships does
a few different types.

162
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,700
Some of them are
institutional scholarships

163
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,700
given by the college,
by the state,

164
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,700
by the government, and so on.

165
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,700
And some of them are private,

166
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,700
given either by private companies
or philanthropy funds,

167
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,700
by different organizations,
which are not related

168
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,700
to the education system itself

169
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,700
directly, okay?
- Right.

170
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,700
Basically, any company
can give out

171
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,700
or any brand
can give out a scholarship.

172
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,700
And they do it, in many cases,
either because it’s considered

173
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,700
a donation, so they get
tax breaks on that.

174
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,700
Okay.

175
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,700
Other because they want
to get the message across

176
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,700
in different ways.

177
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,700
You have a scholarship for

178
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,700
to not to drink and drive,
for example.

179
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,700
So, they want students
to get the message,

180
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,700
they offer a scholarship.

181
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
And unlike many -

182
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,000
Wait. What does that mean,
scholarship with the conception of

183
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,700
don’t drink and drive?

184
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,000
Basically, in order to apply
to many of the scholarships,

185
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,700
you need to do something
to actually apply.

186
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,700
In many cases,
it can be either an essay,

187
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,700
or an image
or video that you need to record.

188
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,700
Hmm?

189
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,700
The students apply.
The students write the essay

190
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,700
or fill out the application, right?

191
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,700
Exactly, yes.

192
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,700
But the organization
that offered the scholarships

193
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,000
decides what the
requirements are gonna be.

194
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,700
Okay.

195
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,700
So, if you're an organization
that tries to fight accidents

196
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,700
caused by the drunk drivers,
you can make the scholarship,

197
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,700
like one of the scholarships
to write an essay

198
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,700
on why drinking
and driving is bad

199
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,700
Okay.

200
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,700
Which means the students
will need to research that,

201
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,200
learn about it,

202
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,700
write an essay about it,
and they get the message across.

203
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,700
That makes sense.

204
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,700
Unlike just putting a TV ad
or something saying,

205
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,700
“Don’t drink and drive,"

206
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,700
making a scholarship
for that causes the student

207
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,700
to get to you
to hear your message,

208
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,700
to actually, internalize
the message.

209
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,700
Sure. Sure.

210
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,000
So, that’s kind of
one side of that equation.

211
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,700
The other side is that
this scholarship

212
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,700
then goes a student,

213
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,700
in most cases,

214
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,200
those outside scholarships
are between $1,000 and $5,000.

215
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,700
Mm-hmm.

216
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,300
And you don’t need to repay them.

217
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,700
You don’t need
to anything, but -

218
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,700
- Right, it's a scholarship.
- But the amount of students that -

219
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,300
It's a scholarship.

220
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,700
Exactly.

221
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,000
But the amount of students
that are awarded the scholarships

222
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,700
are very limited.
- Of course.

223
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,700
- So, where, so where do you -
- But there's a lot of them.

224
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,700
- So, where do you come into this?
- But, and that's exactly -

225
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,700
- there's a lot of
scholarships,

226
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,700
 - there's a lot of them.

227
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,700
- a lot of students,
and there’s a lot of

228
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,460
big mishmash balagan on
matching them.

229
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,700
Right. Exactly.

230
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,700
And that’s exactly
where we come in.

231
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,700
Did I catch the problem right?

232
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,700
You caught the problem precisely.

233
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,700
Okay.

234
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,700
The thing is that
finding all the scholarships

235
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,700
with all the requirements
and all the eligibility

236
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,700
rules they have,
just going through them,

237
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,700
it's a full-time job.

238
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,700
No student can do that, right?

239
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,700
Of course.

240
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,000
And on top of that,
if you go to the easy scholarships,

241
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,700
like the no essay ones
or the ones with very easy,

242
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,700
there’s tens of thousands
of students that apply to them.

243
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,700
So, huge amount of competition
and they maybe award five of them.

244
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,700
- Right.
- That’s kind of the problem.

245
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,700
What we have done is we built
like we mapped all those

246
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,000
kinds of scholarships
with all the requirements,

247
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
eligibility, and so on.

248
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And when the students
comes to us,

249
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
we build the profile
of the student

250
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,700
and we match the students
with all the scholarships

251
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,700
that the student's eligible to.

252
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,700
Now, they still need to do
some of the work.

253
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,700
They still need write an essay.
They still need to do -

254
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,700
- Right, of course.
- You know, maybe

255
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,700
record a video, and so on.

256
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,700
But given the data we have,
we will show him

257
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,000
and recommend the student
the scholarship

258
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,700
that he has the highest
chance of winning.

259
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,000
So, you'll ask the student, "Hey,
give us a little bit of an

260
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,700
Who are you?
What are your interests?

261
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,300
What are your passions?
Tell us everything

262
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,800
you can tell us.
And then, we will

263
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,700
We know of the 10,000
possible scholarships.

264
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,000
And we know
what they’re looking for,

265
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
so we can give you the top 10
so that you don’t have to go

266
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,700
to the other 990" Right? Or the -

267
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,700
- Exactly.
- Okay.

268
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,700
But we go the extra mile here,
because other than

269
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,700
knowing the 10,000 -

270
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,700
tens of thousands
of scholarships,

271
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,000
we also have millions
of students on the platform.

272
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So, we know how many
other students

273
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
are eligible for each scholarship.

274
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,700
- Okay.
- So

275
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,000
the narrower the rules,
the higher the chances

276
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
that you will win -

277
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,500
Right.

278
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,700
which means that
if you invest the same 20 minutes

279
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,000
into writing an essay
on a scholarship

280
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
that has 10,000 applicants
versus a scholarship

281
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,700
that have a hundred -

282
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,000
So, David, it’s like Waze, right?

283
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You know that there is a lot
of traffic in one lane.

284
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
You go to the other
and that this works well

285
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,700
because you worked for Waze.

286
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,700
Exactly.

287
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,700
Now I see where you got
where you got the inspiration.

288
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,700
Definitely, it’s Waze
for scholarships in a way, yes.

289
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,700
We’re trying to show you
Actually, that’s our slogan, right?

290
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,700
It's “The fastest route
to scholarships.”

291
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,700
Okay, you see?
I can go -

292
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,700
It’s exactly that.

293
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,700
- All right.
- You're welcome.

294
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,700
- David
- We'd love that.

295
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,700
Future Minds.
Talk to me about that.

296
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,700
I want to touch,
just before we go to Future Minds.

297
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,700
ScholarshipOwl is our student site.

298
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,300
Yeah.

299
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,300
And last year, we launched
scholarship app,

300
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,700
which is our brand

301
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,700
and organization site,

302
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,700
which is basically a CRM and a CMS

303
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,700
that helps organizations
to offer scholarships easily.

304
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,700
Basically manage
the scholarship itself,

305
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,000
manage the applicants,
manage the award winners,

306
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,700
and so on.

307
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,300
Right.

308
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,700
And we offer the scholarship app
completely for free.

309
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,700
Okay?

310
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,700
With the intention
to make the private scholarship

311
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,700
space as transparent
and trustworthy as possible.

312
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,700
So, basically,
like any organization

313
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,700
or company can come over,
and within 15 minutes,

314
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,700
publish a scholarship
and offer it,

315
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,000
basically increasing the amount
of supply of scholarships

316
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,700
to the demand from students.

317
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,700
So, basically,
we connected the two sites.

318
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,700
Okay.

319
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,700
And our mission as a company
is to make private scholarships

320
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,700
a viable alternative
to student loans.

321
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,700
Yeah.

322
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,700
So, a student goes
to our platform,

323
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:16,700
and if for now doesn’t replace
the student loans completely,

324
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,700
at least, takes a substantial bite
out of student loans

325
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,700
and owes a lot less.

326
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,700
But David, what is
How is the market balanced?

327
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,700
So, how many students

328
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,700
So, every year, how many

329
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,300
How much money do students
need in scholarships?

330
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,700
And how much money
is available through the 10,000

331
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,700
possible scholarships?

332
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,700
Is it about the same amount?

333
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,700
'Cause in my mind,
I would imagine

334
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,700
there is a huge disparity.

335
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,700
So, some of the students
we work with have won

336
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,700
tens of thousands of dollars
just in private scholarships.

337
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,000
Some of the advisers
we worked with got

338
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,700
hundreds of thousands of dollars
in private scholarships.

339
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,700
The majority of students
get nothing, if at all.

340
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,000
And that disparity
is exactly because of that

341
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,700
because it’s so hard
to know what to apply to.

342
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,700
If you have a good system
and you know what you are doing,

343
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,700
you will win scholarships.

344
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,700
Okay.

345
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,700
But to get to that system -
- And obviously every amount helps

346
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,700
It doesn’t even have
to be even,

347
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,700
I don’t need the full ride.

348
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,700
But even just getting me there
substantially

349
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,700
reduces the stress,
the anxiety,

350
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,700
but also the confidence
that I need to go and get

351
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,700
my academic education.

352
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,700
We like to think
of it that way.

353
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:32,700
Thousand dollars in scholarship
was worth $1500 in student loans.

354
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,700
Makes sense.
And that’s, I guess,

355
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,800
mainly looking
at the interest, right?

356
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,300
It’s not just the interest.

357
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:41,800
It’s

358
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,300
Well first you

359
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,300
anyway need to invest to work, right?

360
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,300
If you apply to a scholarship,
you need to invest,

361
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,300
it becomes front-loaded.

362
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,700
You need to invest
to work at the beginning.

363
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,700
Right.

364
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,700
If you go the student loan route,
you need to pay it later,

365
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,700
with interest,

366
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,700
when you’re in a different place
in your life. Basically,

367
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,700
you start paying
your student loans,

368
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,700
well depends
on many conditions,

369
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,700
but basically,
half a year after you graduate

370
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,700
or if you drop out,
which, and the statistics

371
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,700
of dropping out
are pretty awful, right?

372
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,700
Okay.

373
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:21,000
And in fact, 41% of the students
that drop out are dropping out

374
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,700
because of financial reasons.

375
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,700
Wow. That’s insane.
No, but David but I do wanna add also,

376
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,700
in my mind I can see
the viability

377
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,700
of the psychological aspect of it.

378
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,700
You’re getting a scholarship as
for any amount,

379
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,700
whether it’s a thousand dollar
or ten thousand dollars,

380
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,700
that vote of confidence
that somebody’s giving you,

381
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,700
and saying, “I believe in you.
Go and get your education.”

382
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,700
I think that has some impact.

383
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,700
But I can’t believe

384
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,700
we only have about,
five minutes left

385
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,000
and we have to do Future Minds
and I want to talk about the fact

386
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,700
that you’re completely remote,
which in the age of COVID

387
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,700
and the new 2020,
it's so relevant.

388
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,700
But first, Future Minds.

389
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,700
Tell me what this is about.

390
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,700
So, you mentioned COVID.

391
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,700
This week, we launch
Future Minds Fund,

392
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,000
which is based on
the infrastructure

393
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,700
and the products we already have.
It’s a non-profit organization,

394
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:16,700
which is made to help students
that were impacted by COVID-19,

395
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,700
finish their education.

396
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:22,700
We believe that if the students
that will drop out

397
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,700
because of COVID
won't finish their education,

398
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,700
we won't have
professionals tomorrow

399
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,700
to build the world.

400
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,700
We won't have
the future researchers

401
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,700
to cure the next pandemic.

402
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,700
And we have to
save this generation

403
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:40,700
because the students of 2020
will hurt the most in 20 years.

404
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,300
Like it's, the impact
that this pandemic

405
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,300
had on the students
is bigger than on many

406
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,700
other areas of life.

407
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,700
Right.

408
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,700
And Future Minds Fund
is built in a way that to,

409
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,000
Our platforms

410
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
students can apply
to those scholarships.

411
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
We basically launched.
We began by launching

412
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
three scholarships ourselves,
which were targeted at students

413
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,300
that lost their income
while studying.

414
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,700
So, if you had a side job
or things like that, and you lost it,

415
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,700
and you cannot
finish your studies

416
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,700
because of that.
Students that had to

417
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,700
rearrange their whole living
situation because they need to

418
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,700
now study from home.
You know you used to study in the library

419
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,700
or in

420
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,900
in college group,
you cannot do that anymore.

421
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,900
You need a chair. You need a desk.

422
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,900
You need a desk.
You need a chair.

423
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,900
You need a laptop.
You need maybe some books.

424
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,900
There's a lot
of things you need,

425
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,900
which you didn’t count for.

426
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,700
And like you said,
$400 can be a lot of money.

427
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,700
And now suddenly
you need to set up

428
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,700
the whole environment.
So, we begin by setting up

429
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,700
our own scholarships for that.

430
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,700
But then,

431
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,700
I’m sorry, I got distracted.

432
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,700
So, you set up your own
scholarship for that?

433
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,700
Yes. So, we set up our own
three scholarships for that.

434
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:00,700
And we got over 6,000 applicants
over one weekend.

435
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,700
Wow.

436
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,000
Somebody opened
the door and I got distracted.

437
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,700
No worries.

438
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,700
So, again

439
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,700
So, you launched
your scholarship

440
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,700
Let’s go back.

441
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,700
Yeah. So, we launched
three scholarships by ourselves,

442
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,700
basically scholarships
that are targeted

443
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,700
at helping students
that lost their side income

444
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,700
during the studies
because many

445
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,700
the students are dependent
on side income.

446
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,700
And you had
6,000 applicants, right?

447
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,700
And we had over 6,000 applicants

448
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,000
over one weekend alone.

449
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,700
One weekend.

450
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,700
So, we saw

451
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,000
there is a huge demand.
- And these are students

452
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,700
that were impacted by COVID
and they need assistance

453
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,700
to complete their studies.

454
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,700
This is not just any -

455
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,700
Only COVID.

456
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,700
The scholarships we launched
are only COVID-19-related.

457
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,700
So, where is this headed?

458
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,700
Can other organizations
come and also provide scholarships?

459
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,300
After we saw the demand,

460
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,300
which was way bigger
than we anticipated,

461
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,000
we reached out to a few
other organizations in

462
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,700
the higher education space
to help us out.

463
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,700
In that way, we’ve been able
to award 19 scholarships

464
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,700
also.
- Wow!

465
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,700
But when we saw the potential
of that, we decided to open it

466
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,700
to the general public.

467
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,700
Yeah.

468
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,700
And we launched
a non-profit organization

469
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,700
and a fund dedicated to that,

470
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,000
on which anybody, basically,
can go to our website,

471
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,300
see the story of each student
separately,

472
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,300
like how he was impacted.
What happened?

473
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,700
And then, it's like a GoFundMe
where they can sponsor students?

474
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,300
Exactly.

475
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,000
I love it.

476
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Exactly. It’s a GoFund

477
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
It’s a public funding
campaign for students.

478
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I love it.
David, very inspiring.

479
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Is this

480
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,700
Do you see this specific
for COVID? And that said,

481
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,700
do you see this in the long-term
as a way for students

482
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,700
to share their story
and get assistance for education?

483
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,300
Where do you see this going?

484
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,700
I mean, our immediate goal
was to help the students

485
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,700
that were impacted now.

486
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,700
But I don’t see
why that wouldn’t become

487
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,700
a more permanent thing.

488
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,700
Right.

489
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,000
Helping different causes
and different

490
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
helping students impacted
by different situations

491
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,700
or conditions that are happening

492
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
- I love it.
- in the US

493
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,700
Yeah. David, very quickly, how
long have you been with ScholarshipOwl?

494
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,700
Or has the company
been living as a whole?

495
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,700
I’ve been with
ScholarshipOwl since 2015.

496
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,700
So, five years now.
- And how many

497
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,700
how many people are in it?

498
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,700
We’re now 35 people.

499
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,700
35 people and
everybody’s remote, right?

500
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,700
All remote.  As I like to say,
we're spread from Vegas to Bali.

501
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,700
I love it. Okay.

502
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,000
So, David, we’re gonna
have to do another episode,

503
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,700
which will be featured
a few months from now

504
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,300
where we only talk about
this remote thing because

505
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,300
I think that is just as relevant
to this whole new 2020.

506
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,700
And I need to learn how to start
working full time remote,

507
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,700
because, I think, we all have
to learn that now.

508
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,700
I think that COVID
has basically accelerated

509
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,700
the remote workspace
tens of years within one year.

510
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,700
Unbelievable.

511
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,300
David, right before we leave,
I need three words

512
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,000
that you would best
describe yourself.

513
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,700
And I’m gonna ask
you the same question

514
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,700
in a few months
when we do the next episode.

515
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,700
So, make sure
to be consistent.

516
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,700
[laughs] We’re ... recording
to remember, right?

517
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:23,700
Three words that describe myself.

518
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,700
Ginger

519
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,700
[laughs]

520
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:35,700
Committed and curious.

521
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,700
I love it.

522
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,700
Gingie, committed, and curious.

523
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,300
Right.

524
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:40,800
Beautiful.

525
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,700
David, thank you very much.
Toda raba.

526
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,700
And best of luck
with ScholarshipOwl.

527
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,700
I really hope
you get to help these thousands

528
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:51,700
of students now during COVID,
and thank you for the work

529
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,700
that you’re doing
for the millions of others

530
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,700
that need assistance
on a yearly basis

531
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,700
going into college.

532
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,700
I think you’re doing a great,
great service to all of them.

533
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,700
So, thank you.

534
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,700
Thank you very much for having me.

535
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,700
- Take care and bye-bye.
- And see you in a few months.

536
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,700
Bye.
