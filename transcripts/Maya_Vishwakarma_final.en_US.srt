1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,280
Menstrual hygiene

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,880
is a very, very taboo job in our area.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,120
I mean, you cannot talk to the men

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,720
about the menstrual periods

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:21,760
or any kind of issue.

6
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,480
Maya Vishwakarma, thank you so much

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,440
for joining me on my show.

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,800
How are you?

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,400
I'm really great.

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,080
I'm doing good.

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,640
It's beautiful here in California.

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,253
So, yeah.

13
00:00:52,254 --> 00:00:55,120
It's nice, yeah.

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,720
Thank you so much

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,480
for joining me all the way

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,080
from California.

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,000
But really, what we'll talk about

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,920
is not California.

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,360
We're going to talk

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,120
about India today, right.

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,360
Because you're doing

22
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,600
some fascinating work

23
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,960
with India and helping a lot of people,

24
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,560
both locally and at scale.

25
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,680
So, I want to just dive straight into it.

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,680
Maya, tell me a little bit

27
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,480
about your journey

28
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,520
and how do you get

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,320
to work in rural Indian,

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,720
helping a lot of women?

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,040
Yes.

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,360
So, Michael, I am born

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,920
and brought up in India.

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,034
It's a very small village

35
00:01:24,035 --> 00:01:26,000
called Mehragaon,

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,360
and it's like you can't even find

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,120
in the Google map.

38
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,480
And that's where I grew up.

39
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,840
And I came all the way from there

40
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,480
to the United States.

41
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,640
And then I study science.

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,520
And then I was doing

43
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,440
my PhD program in South Dakota.

44
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,320
After two years, I dropped it

45
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,840
and I joined the research here.

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,960
And one thing I realized,

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,560
like how many people comes from

48
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,480
that far to here and pursue the study

49
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,440
and have a good life.

50
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,160
And the things I've seen

51
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,080
in my village, back in my village

52
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,880
and problems are arising.

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,640
So, I thought, like,

54
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,800
let's give some try

55
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,680
and, you know,

56
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,520
just serve those people.

57
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,640
So, I went back to my village,

58
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,000
search of all the problems,

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,160
I knew also because I grew up there.

60
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,600
So, then I find out, like, okay,

61
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,560
these are the bigger issues which I can,

62
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,680
you know, work easily

63
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,800
because nothing is like,

64
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,240
difficult for me

65
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,480
since I know the people,

66
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,880
language and culture and everything.

67
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,680
So, then I started

68
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,480
with this project called

69
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,800
menstrual hygiene awareness

70
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
affordability and availability.

71
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,040
These three things like,

72
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,880
it has to be there

73
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,880
because in the remote area everywhere,

74
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,000
this is the women hygiene,

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,960
women hygiene is a big issue everywhere,

76
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,079
most of the part.

77
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,920
So, tell me a little bit

78
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,040
about this big issue.

79
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,080
What is the issue

80
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,320
and what is the scale of it as well?

81
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:57,960
Because, you know,

82
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,920
coming from a place

83
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,680
that's a little far away,

84
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,160
it's a little distant

85
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,240
from my understanding.

86
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,280
So, share with me a little bit

87
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,560
about what's actually happening.

88
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:08,920
Yes.

89
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,880
So, the thing is, like earlier time,

90
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,120
like, if you talk

91
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,400
about like our grandmas time,

92
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,960
that time, they were like,

93
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,400
you know, very, very

94
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
accu with the cotton clothes.

95
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,560
We all know, like, you know,

96
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,200
all the time,

97
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,720
the women they used to have

98
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,880
the good cotton in the abundance

99
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,080
that they can change

100
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,560
that cloth every time they can dry.

101
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,800
And they had that kind of a freedom.

102
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,960
But over the time

103
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,480
we replaced that cotton

104
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,520
with the synthetic,

105
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,840
with the other materials

106
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,640
and then families getting divided

107
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,160
and then the women space

108
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,440
got very, very small.

109
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:52,240
And now, the new modern India

110
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,720
so-called like the

111
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,400
architecture of the houses,

112
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,680
the buildings that are build,

113
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,200
you can't dry that clothes in a sun.

114
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,720
And it is a big taboo in India.

115
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,200
So, if you can't dry

116
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,240
and you can't wash that clothes,

117
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,204
then ultimately, it will be

118
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:10,440
making you sick.

119
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:12,760
And nowadays it's very, very hard

120
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,720
because one woman is using

121
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,880
the same clothes over

122
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,640
and over and over and over.

123
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,200
And especially in the rainy season,

124
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,680
it gets really moisture

125
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,920
and that's how they got UTI,

126
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,080
URTI, cervical cancer

127
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,920
and so many of those stuff.

128
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,760
So, this is the major issue.

129
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,360
And because of

130
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,440
the biggest population in India,

131
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,440
like we are billions in India,

132
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,440
so, it's a hard to reach out

133
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,800
the sanitary pad to each and everyone

134
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,000
in the remote, in the tribal area.

135
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,960
So, most of the women

136
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,680
who are living in the outside,

137
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,840
like outskirt countryside,

138
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,880
they don't even know

139
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,400
what is sanitary pad.

140
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,880
And if they know the sanitary pad,

141
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,280
it is so expensive

142
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,440
that they can't even afford it.

143
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,720
Because it comes with a,

144
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,600
it doesn't come with the livelihood

145
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,280
because they had

146
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,120
to arrange first the food,

147
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,840
and then only

148
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,320
they can think about other stuff.

149
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,560
So, most of the population

150
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,000
can't afford such expensive pads.

151
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,400
And if they can afford then

152
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,800
it's not available there.

153
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,440
So, then we started thinking about it

154
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,880
and then we thought, like,

155
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,000
you know how to solve this problem

156
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,640
in our area, actually.

157
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,320
So, tell me a little bit about

158
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,680
this problem solving thinking.

159
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,120
First of all, how would you define

160
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,160
the scale of this problem?

161
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,840
So, how many people do you think

162
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,480
are lacking this proper hygiene

163
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,440
or sanitation right now,

164
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,600
because of these different norms

165
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,120
in modern India?

166
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,960
How big is this problem

167
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,440
that you're tackling?

168
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,760
So, the problem is really, really huge.

169
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,000
The data says like

170
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,680
still in the modern age

171
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,120
in India, all the rural place,

172
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,640
70% population is still not getting

173
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,520
the hygienic stuff.

174
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,040
Wow.

175
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:10,720
70% in the village in the rural India,

176
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,880
they are not getting the sanitary pad

177
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,840
or any hygienic stuff.

178
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,680
So, the problem is very, very big,

179
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,280
very, very high.

180
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,200
And I tell you, like 12% girls,

181
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,800
they drop out because of this issue.

182
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,520
Because in the school,

183
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,680
when they get to periods,

184
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,040
they don't have pads.

185
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,160
They use the clothes

186
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,440
and then they go to school

187
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,760
and the school doesn't have toilets,

188
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,280
and, you know, comfort kind of place

189
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,560
where they can change.

190
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,920
So, they don't go to school.

191
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,480
And then finally, they drop out.

192
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,040
So, 12% girls

193
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,720
they drop out from the school

194
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,120
because of the sanitary pad.

195
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,320
Unbelievable.

196
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,440
And so, tell me a little bit

197
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,320
about your experience.

198
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,560
How do you even get involved

199
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,840
with thinking about a problem like this

200
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,440
and knowing that this is something

201
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,320
that you're passionate about solving?

202
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,760
Yeah, because this relate

203
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,120
to my own story.

204
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,200
When I was growing up in those areas,

205
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,880
I was also one of them in my teens,.

206
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,800
So, in my high school.

207
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,840
I also feel the similar issues,

208
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,240
like using the clothes,

209
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,360
and very hard time for drying them.

210
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,280
And if they dry it's hard to keep them

211
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,320
like six hours or so.

212
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,080
So, all these difficulties,

213
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,360
I went through.

214
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,160
And then, you know,

215
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,720
over the time, I also got some

216
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
kind of infections

217
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,080
and all issues like the other women's.

218
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,440
And then because I was always

219
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,720
a ward in a hospital

220
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,160
in the medical research.

221
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,160
So, I thought,

222
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,920
I may can solve these issues

223
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,320
because this relate to me.

224
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,040
This is my very, very intimate,

225
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,440
you know, issue that I can understand

226
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,080
other girls, other women.

227
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,120
So, then I went there

228
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,200
and then I talked to the women's

229
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,960
and heard their issues,

230
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,000
their problems.

231
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,240
And then we thought, like, okay,

232
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,000
how can we go one by one,

233
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,280
one step at the time.

234
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,280
Then we find out, like,

235
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,560
you know, who is the guy,

236
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,360
I mean, who's the guy

237
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,320
working on these issues.

238
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,000
Then I travel all over India,

239
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,760
find out some people.

240
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,320
And one of them is like,

241
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,680
Arunachalam Muruganantham,

242
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,720
he's the guy

243
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,720
who's biopic is very, very famous.

244
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,240
It's called Pad Man.

245
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,960
So, it is like one of the big

246
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,120
blockbuster in India.

247
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,880
So, that guy I met

248
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,320
and he was kind of inspirational.

249
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,120
And then I started arranging machines

250
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,840
the materials and the women's

251
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,760
and the trainings

252
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,000
and scalabilities and everything.

253
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,920
So, it's around like

254
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,520
six, seven years journey, yeah.

255
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,800
So, you're saying it as if

256
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,280
it's a very, very simple.

257
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,840
Yes, scalability, and that everything,

258
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,040
but I would love to hear that story.

259
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,000
Because I think that's really

260
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,520
where it gets fascinating,

261
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,360
how you can actually

262
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,800
take this idea, take this poll

263
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,280
and bring it to fruition

264
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,760
and create a product that actually makes

265
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,000
such a strong impact,

266
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,680
especially in a population

267
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,720
where it's not the same thing

268
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,480
as creating a product

269
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,640
and marketing it to a bunch of consumers

270
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,520
right in the United States.

271
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,160
It's a different type of problem,

272
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,840
it's a different type of distribution.

273
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,520
So, tell me first a little bit about

274
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,200
the solution that you found,

275
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,920
and then I would love

276
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,680
to really talk about the distribution

277
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,400
and the scalability of it.

278
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,880
How do you get it

279
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,600
to all these women?

280
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,720
Because it's again,

281
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,400
it's a very different industry

282
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,000
from those that I'm used to.

283
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,720
Yes. So, it is completely different

284
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,920
because it's a hygiene kind of industry.

285
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,080
And very few people work

286
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,920
for that issues

287
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,720
because all the multi company

288
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,400
come forward

289
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,880
and then they take over this.

290
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,560
But the problem is, first of all,

291
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,720
in our area, it's like agricultural area.

292
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,840
And the income

293
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,120
of the poor family capital

294
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,680
is very, very less.

295
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,160
And they mostly spend in like,

296
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,680
you know, food

297
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,280
and arranging other stuff.

298
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,880
So, the women hygiene comes

299
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,640
at the very last end.

300
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,280
Like here in the United States,

301
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,000
we live here,

302
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,840
we include the sanity pad

303
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,720
and all the hygiene stuff

304
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,600
in our monthly budget.

305
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
So, we buy at the same time like,

306
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,280
you know, when we

307
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,840
are buying our groceries

308
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,160
or vegetables or other things,

309
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,800
but not in India.

310
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,080
It's not even considered

311
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,960
like it is a things to buy.

312
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,560
So the thing is like, when the women,

313
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,400
they are not getting on the time,

314
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,440
they are not educated,

315
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,040
they are not aware, we didn't had

316
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,520
any kind of syllabus in our book

317
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,720
right up to 10th grade

318
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,320
that the hygiene should be,

319
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,000
you know, included.

320
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,240
And this is the prominent issues

321
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,240
and all the girls,

322
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,120
they should learn about

323
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,600
this thing in a school.

324
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,000
So, this is like really big issues

325
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,240
in our community.

326
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,480
So, then what I thought, like,

327
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,400
okay, how difficult it is. Right?

328
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,480
Because I'm already working

329
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,400
in a science side

330
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,920
and medical side and other stuff.

331
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,800
That time I was working in UCSF.

332
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,840
So, then I spoke to the local people

333
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,920
like how big this taboo is.

334
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:06,000
And it is a big taboo

335
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,640
because nobody wants to talk

336
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,200
about this problem.

337
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,800
So, first thing, you are a local

338
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,640
and you need to talk to the people

339
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,240
and convince them

340
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,960
that like, I really want to work

341
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,400
on this issues in this area only.

342
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,280
Because I can work anywhere in India.

343
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,920
But why I chose my own district,

344
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,960
location, hometown area?

345
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,400
Because I understand people

346
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,520
and I want to solve that problem

347
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,240
from that community.

348
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,760
So, then we arrange the machines

349
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,160
and then, you know,

350
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,880
the material which comes all the way

351
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,280
from China, as we all know,

352
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,400
like it's all standard.

353
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,840
And then we find out

354
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,680
the good machines

355
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,840
and we hired the women

356
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,680
who are actually looking for a job.

357
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,120
They are like a daily worker,

358
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,080
the daily wage worker.

359
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,680
Amazing.

360
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,640
Yeah. So, we hired them.

361
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,960
We train them

362
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,920
what is a hygiene,

363
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,120
how to make sanity pads.

364
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,080
But it's a very small scale

365
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,120
that we were working earlier.

366
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,480
But then slowly,

367
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,160
we gave them confidence

368
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,000
like, hey, this is your product,

369
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,600
you are going to work here,

370
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,160
and we gave the brand

371
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,760
this called No Tension sanitary pad.

372
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,440
And they got like very happy like,

373
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,080
hey, this is our own products

374
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,440
we are making

375
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,640
and we are distributing.

376
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,480
So, then that gets like really, really

377
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,000
around the cities

378
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,520
and then the villages.

379
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
And then we reach out

380
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,320
to the more women.

381
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,000
Because in India

382
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,280
the sector is divided.

383
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Like the men's,

384
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,840
they work in a different parts

385
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,400
and the women,

386
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,520
they work in a different work.

387
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,600
It's like the industry side,

388
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,640
you will find the more men

389
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,560
and the less women.

390
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,920
But in agriculture,

391
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,400
there is like 50%, 50-50.

392
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,920
And then there are some certain groups

393
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,330
in all the villages like

394
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:58,520
ASHA karykarta workers, those groups,

395
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,400
they are only for the women.

396
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,520
So, the women to women

397
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,920
it's easy to spread out the word,

398
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,280
spread out the products.

399
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,800
And after that,

400
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:09,960
after manufacturing the pad,

401
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,680
then I thought like maybe

402
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,360
the education is

403
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,400
the most important key

404
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,000
to, you know, educate them

405
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,200
about the awareness,

406
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,440
how to use pads,

407
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,080
how to dispose the pad.

408
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,200
Because the environmental issue

409
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,120
is also coming up in landfilling

410
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,760
and plastics and all that.

411
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,840
So, we need to approach

412
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,040
in a holistic way

413
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,400
where we are giving the solution

414
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,440
also, we are giving the

415
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,600
other solution to dispose

416
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,960
the sanitary pad.

417
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,680
Because in India

418
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,560
we don't have like, you know,

419
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,200
things like separation

420
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,920
and segregations and all that.

421
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,400
We dump at the one place

422
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,360
or we burn at the one place.

423
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,280
So, this is how

424
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,040
this was very critical because, you know,

425
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,480
the awareness and the education part.

426
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,040
So, I took the place

427
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,920
that I will go around that area

428
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,480
and stay on the road for, like,

429
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,320
you know, a couple of months

430
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,240
and educate all the schools

431
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,120
and the girls hostel

432
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,680
and the Tivoli in terms

433
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,320
of the menstrual hygiene,

434
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,160
like the awareness program.

435
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,480
So, we designed the program,

436
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,240
we designed the material.

437
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,200
And then I went to 15 tribal area,

438
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,280
stayed there for a few days,

439
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,880
and then, you know,

440
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,800
take the workshop and the conferences

441
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,280
and the classes in all,

442
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,040
you know, girl kind of a hostel.

443
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,120
So, you can meet like larger population

444
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,480
from a different villages,

445
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,600
you train all the girls,

446
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,440
like how to spread this message,

447
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,440
how to reach out

448
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,360
to other women in your village.

449
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,160
Very, very cool.

450
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,120
Exactly.

451
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,400
So, this program

452
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,840
went like really very, very successful

453
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,160
and all the media is covered.

454
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,480
And it came in the local news

455
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,880
so that other people also

456
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,280
they were reading.

457
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,480
And this was kind of eye openers.

458
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,560
And that time the movie

459
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,960
was coming like Pad Man.

460
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,840
So, eventually my name

461
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,720
came up as a pad woman of India.

462
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,920
So, this was the time

463
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,760
where I spent most of the time

464
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,000
on the road,

465
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,480
and then I spread out like,

466
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,560
you know, I reach out

467
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,000
to thousands of girls,

468
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,360
women's need it.

469
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,600
They had millions of questions

470
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,560
like, hey, why this happens,

471
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,840
why that happens and so many.

472
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,600
And unfortunately,

473
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,920
there's no system where

474
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,360
they can ask their queries

475
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,600
and they can get the right answer

476
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,538
and they can study well.

477
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:34,280
Because, you know,

478
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,920
when you have something in your mind

479
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,840
and you are not getting answers on time,

480
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,040
then you cannot focus on your study

481
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,360
or in your daily day-to-day life.

482
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,720
So, this is how like, you know,

483
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,520
we spread out this awareness programs

484
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,520
and the sanitary pads

485
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,520
all over the places.

486
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,680
I think that's just remarkable.

487
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,000
Tell me a little bit about

488
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,280
the most difficult thing

489
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
that you've encountered

490
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,080
throughout this process.

491
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,160
Because you make it

492
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,400
sound relatively okay.

493
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,160
But I'm sure that

494
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,720
it was incredibly difficult.

495
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,200
I mean, you're talking about

496
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,240
having to find a holistic approach

497
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,640
to solving an incredible need

498
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,640
within the country

499
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,920
that has billions of people,

500
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,560
and you're talking about something

501
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,320
with a population

502
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,040
that doesn't necessarily

503
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,720
have also the funds

504
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,760
and education to start with.

505
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,480
So, I'd love to hear a little bit about

506
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,680
the greatest challenges

507
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,640
that you've had along the way.

508
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,280
Yeah. So, the challenges is like I mean,

509
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,720
if I were work in San Francisco,

510
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,160
I have an excellent like,

511
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,720
you know, teams I can find,

512
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,800
I can hire people,

513
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,240
I can get the best of the best,

514
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,360
you know, talent there.

515
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,760
But when you when you go

516
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,320
to the grassroots level,

517
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,880
work in a very, very like,

518
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,080
you know, deep into interior,

519
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,480
you had a very hard time to find

520
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,400
a suitable person for the suitable job.

521
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,880
So, this was my biggest challenge,

522
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,280
that I cannot find the accountant,

523
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,480
I cannot find a computer guy,

524
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,600
I cannot find a data entry

525
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,240
because you are living with nothing.

526
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,400
There's no I mean, hardly electricity.

527
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,680
And you have challenges

528
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,480
like network and so many things.

529
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,800
So, getting the right team

530
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,240
on the right time,

531
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,640
understanding, you know,

532
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,040
they would understand your issue

533
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,320
and you would understand their issue,

534
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,920
it's a difficult part.

535
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,160
And then other difficult one

536
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:28,360
was because menstrual hygiene

537
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,960
is a very, very taboo job in our area.

538
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,240
I mean, you cannot talk to the men

539
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,760
about the menstrual periods

540
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,720
or any kind of issue.

541
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,920
Convincing them, telling them,

542
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,440
hey, this is your family,

543
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,720
so this is your maybe mom issues,

544
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,440
sister issues, wife issues,

545
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,400
you know, we need to speak up about it.

546
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,840
And then sometimes they get like,

547
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,720
you know, they hide,

548
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,720
they just, you know, feel shy.

549
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,520
And even the women also

550
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,040
they feel very shy.

551
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,920
Like if you if you go to the room

552
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,320
and where 10, 20 women are sitting

553
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,400
and you start speaking about the period,

554
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,000
they will go away.

555
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,480
So, you cannot do that.

556
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,680
You have to relate with something

557
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,080
to something to something

558
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,720
and then you come up

559
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,000
on the on the real talk

560
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,160
like the periods

561
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,840
and other sort of issues.

562
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,200
Because it's a very, very big taboo.

563
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,440
And fighting on that is like it's a hard.

564
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,560
So, these kind of issues I faced

565
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,800
in the beginning,

566
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,600
but when you open about yourself,

567
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,200
you train like women

568
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,080
and then 10 people other,

569
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,160
they are speaking with you

570
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,720
with the same issue,

571
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,000
then people will believe.

572
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,440
Like, hey, this is something

573
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,880
that we really need to listen,

574
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,680
this is something we really need to talk.

575
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,960
So, these are the issues which I go,

576
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,920
and I'm still facing the challenges

577
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,040
to get the right team,

578
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,720
to get the right people

579
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,480
for my job in this scalability

580
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,960
is very difficult.

581
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,280
So, slowly we are training people slowly,

582
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,840
slowly we are involving.

583
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,360
Right.

584
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,000
So, then, you know, things will improve.

585
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,920
I know it will be

586
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,080
a never ending challenge for us, yeah.

587
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:16,880
Unbelievable.

588
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,240
Maya, I have to say that

589
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,560
it's inspiring to hear

590
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,440
the both the challenges,

591
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,160
but also you know,

592
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,240
that the incredible work

593
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,400
that you're doing over there.

594
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,200
I think it's incredibly innovative.

595
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,240
And to me personally,

596
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,480
it's inspiring to see somebody

597
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,080
who goes after such an important topic

598
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,200
from the get go.

599
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,080
And I want to thank you

600
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,240
for being so generous with your time

601
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,600
in the past 20 minutes.

602
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,120
I'd love for you to share with me

603
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,240
three words that you would use

604
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,120
to describe yourself.

605
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,960
So, in three words,

606
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,120
I can say that I'm very fearless,

607
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,800
very confident and very,

608
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,320
I would say the learner for a lifetime.

609
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
So, these are the three words

610
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,080
which I want to conclude this.

611
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:01,880
Amazing.

612
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,560
Maya, thank you very, very much.

613
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,240
This was wonderful.

614
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,720
Continue making such a positive impact.

615
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,880
And stay safe and stay healthy.

616
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,720
Yeah, you too.

617
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,920
Thank you so much.

618
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,560
Happy holidays

619
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:18,080
and happy New Year in advance.
