1
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,920
Ayal Yogev, thank you so much

2
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,640
for being on my show.

3
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,840
How are you?

4
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,320
Good, good.

5
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,960
Thank you for having me.

6
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,520
Of course.

7
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,040
So, incredible journey

8
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,040
that I can't wait to dive into,

9
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,680
whether it's from starting a company

10
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,280
which you're doing now,

11
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,960
to being a VP product at a startup.

12
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,120
But before that, being in a corporate

13
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,760
like Cisco and that whole transition.

14
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,640
But even before that,

15
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,160
drawing on your, what you say,

16
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,800
your first entrepreneurial experience,

17
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,480
so commanding one of the most prestigious

18
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,640
computer courses

19
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,520
in the Israeli Defense Forces,

20
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,040
which I think

21
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,000
it's an incredible take to look at it

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,200
from an entrepreneurial perspective.

23
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,040
So, I can't wait to hear about that.

24
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,840
But before everything

25
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,280
Ayal, we have to talk

26
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
a little bit about Survivor.

27
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,200
Because I'm a huge huge fan.

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,040
It's been a dream

29
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,400
since I'm like six years old

30
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,680
to be on Survivor.

31
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,080
Why do you love the show?

32
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,720
I love the game.

33
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,400
It's such a smart and fun game.

34
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,800
And basically, you throw

35
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,120
a bunch of people onto an island,

36
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,160
I guess, it's not about these competitions

37
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,720
that they do, it's about the social game

38
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,760
and how you get people to follow you.

39
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,520
And eventually, you're essentially

40
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,520
you vote them out,

41
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,200
you do all the things

42
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,400
and eventually [--] them

43
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,200
to vote for you

44
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,280
and how you handle the social,

45
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,840
it's just phenomenal.

46
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,320
I think it's exactly,

47
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,480
it's such an incredible game.

48
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,080
Because like you're saying,

49
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,040
a lot of people are enjoying

50
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,920
the challenges and the drama,

51
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,840
it's not about that.

52
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,040
It's about this whole idea of

53
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,880
how do you go through a journey

54
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,440
and reaching the finals is not enough

55
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,880
because then you have to have the jury.

56
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,160
People that you blindsided

57
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,480
and you voted out coming in.

58
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,760
And I don't want to give any spoilers

59
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,000
to people, but I'll give a small one.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,720
There is a player on the American series

61
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,840
who I believe got to second place

62
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,480
twice or three times

63
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,680
over the 40 seasons.

64
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,760
So, they brought this player back

65
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,360
because he was so entertaining

66
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,640
and he's very very intelligent.

67
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
He runs, I believe,

68
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,360
a fuel company in the US.

69
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,320
But he only managed to get second place

70
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,440
exactly for that reason.

71
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,600
Because he missed out on that

72
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,560
other whole aspect of the game.

73
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,040
And so, we have much more to talk about.

74
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,880
I'm actually now watching

75
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,560
the 37th season and I'm loving it,

76
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,240
but we'll have to catch up

77
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,680
a little bit later about that.

78
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,960
Ayal, take me back to your journey.

79
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,080
Who are you

80
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,640
way before you started

81
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,840
a cybersecurity company

82
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,200
here in the United States?

83
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,240
Sure. So I guess very, very quickly,

84
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,960
I started my journey

85
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,040
in the Israeli intelligence forces.

86
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,440
And basically I joined

87
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,120
when I was in unit 8200,

88
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,080
but I cannot say that in the podcast.

89
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,880
And essentially I've been there

90
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,560
for about six years.

91
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,360
And I guess my last,

92
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,760
the last thing I did there

93
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,120
was running a course,

94
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,760
as you said, it was one of the,

95
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,560
it's the course that I probably

96
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,440
wouldn't have got into

97
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,160
as a teen as an 18 year old.

98
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,320
But I was so lucky enough

99
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,200
to be part of essentially, starting there

100
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:32,400
I was very involved since the first one

101
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,180
and got to be the commander

102
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,220
of the first one.

103
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,930
Oh wow, I didn't know that. Wow.

104
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:36,920
Yeah. I was a teacher

105
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,040
in the first and second one,

106
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,880
and then I was commanding the fifth one.

107
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,760
So, again, it was an amazing experience.

108
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,560
And what's very unique

109
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,320
about this specific,

110
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,400
I don't think I'm gonna dive deeper

111
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,560
into that,

112
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,480
but what's unique is that

113
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,680
it basically involves

114
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,560
a lot of different units

115
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,440
within the Israeli intelligence community.

116
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,560
Which is extremely unique

117
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,880
for any course, which again poses

118
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,400
a bunch of unique challenges

119
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,640
that you don't see in other courses

120
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,200
in terms of,

121
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,520
and again, I can't go in depth

122
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,840
but there's so much

123
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,000
of the politics behind it.

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,880
Everybody wants to get

125
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,400
the best people to come in,

126
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,640
but they don't actually want

127
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,720
to give the resources

128
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,520
because there's this other unit

129
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,680
needs to give the resources.

130
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,800
Right. Now, Ayal, just for context,

131
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,600
because a lot of people

132
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,320
that are watching this

133
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,960
from outside of Israel may not realize,

134
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,680
but this specific course in general,

135
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,080
the Army does a really great job

136
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,680
at creating this filter.

137
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,640
They're starting out

138
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,520
that they're getting anybody

139
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,680
who might be remotely interested

140
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,640
in computer science

141
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,080
going through a series of tests

142
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,520
just as comprehensive, if not,

143
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,960
more than the college applications

144
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,520
to Stanford, MIT or Harvard.

145
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,720
It's really remarkable

146
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,160
the way that they're doing it.

147
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,800
At the end, you reach a cohort

148
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,520
of just a few dozen people

149
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,400
out of thousands.

150
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,360
And it's like this childhood dream.

151
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,840
If before, people dreamt of being pilots

152
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,600
and dreamt of being

153
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,080
in the elite combat units,

154
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,080
now, a lot of people are dreaming about

155
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,640
getting to the course, specific one

156
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,760
that you helped initiate

157
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,760
and that you commanded

158
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,240
its fifth iteration.

159
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,080
And so, that's also why people

160
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,760
that are in the course,

161
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,840
they're so sought after

162
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,800
and to all the other units,

163
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,840
because these are

164
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,480
some of the most brilliant minds.

165
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,720
Talk to me a little bit about being 23,

166
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,880
getting thrown into this responsibility

167
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,000
of leading this course.

168
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,400
And you're saying that this is

169
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,920
your first entrepreneurial journey, right?

170
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,520
Yes, exactly.

171
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,640
Part of this was the fact

172
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,760
that you have to,

173
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,000
you're getting 23 years old,

174
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,480
you're not extremely senior

175
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,480
in terms of your rank,

176
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,520
but then you have to deal with

177
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,120
all these extremely senior people.

178
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,040
The head of the steering committee

179
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,080
for the course

180
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,240
is the second in command in unit 8200.

181
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,480
And you have to deal with

182
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,280
all these people

183
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,000
that are basically

184
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,880
10 levels higher than you are

185
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,480
from all these different units.

186
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,720
And again, and you need to make sure that,

187
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,520
and one thing is they give you this

188
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,040
you can do whatever you want, right?

189
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,520
You can do, you can pretty much,

190
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,200
obviously on the technical side,

191
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,960
none of these people

192
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,880
really have any idea

193
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,520
what you're doing.

194
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,560
You know way better than they are.

195
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
But also just in terms of leadership

196
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,240
you are thrown in this remote location

197
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,520
that's not within one of the bases.

198
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,720
And you can pretty much,

199
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,880
you have all this freedom

200
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,560
to get people ready

201
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,720
and do what you need to do

202
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,520
to get them ready for their service.

203
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,000
But the other thing is the resources.

204
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,320
It's getting the resources that you need,

205
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,360
getting everything, pulling together

206
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,920
the things that you need

207
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,080
from all these different units.

208
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,600
It was an amazing experience

209
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,680
that it taught me a lot about

210
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,640
how to handle large organizations;

211
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,200
how to handle politics;

212
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,000
how to work with people who are not,

213
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,920
obviously, they'll report to you,

214
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,520
but also they are

215
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,800
much more senior than you.

216
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,280
It was, and again, an amazing experience.

217
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,120
I probably think some of the gray hair

218
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,080
that I have now,

219
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,120
it's probably due to that experience,

220
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,720
but it was amazing.

221
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,280
And the other one

222
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,640
even more amazing thing is that

223
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,480
I actually I met my wife.

224
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,440
She was actually running

225
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,200
the recruitment process for this course,

226
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,000
and that's how we met.

227
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,960
Oh, that's just beautiful.

228
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
That's wonderful.

229
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,720
But the course itself,

230
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,680
it's not just another programming course.

231
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,440
There's a lot of courses out there.

232
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,600
It's not like taking a class at MIT

233
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,560
and it's not like going

234
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,520
to a summer program to learn how to code.

235
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,280
This is a very intensive period,

236
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,080
where you,

237
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,480
as the commander over the course,

238
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,160
don't just have

239
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,600
the professional responsibility

240
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,440
for the people going through it,

241
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,720
but you're really responsible

242
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,960
for their livelihoods

243
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,440
over the course of a few months.

244
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,800
They're relocated to another area

245
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,720
and they look at you

246
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,520
as the commander in charge.

247
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,560
And like you're mentioning, at 23,

248
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,080
you're given responsibility

249
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,640
that a lot of people

250
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,200
that are ten ranks above you,

251
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,520
that's the responsibility

252
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,840
that they've been working for

253
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,080
for a long time.

254
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,880
So, definitely, I totally appreciate

255
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,720
what you're doing there.

256
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,760
And I helped teach quite a bit

257
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,920
in different courses,

258
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,040
not the specific one,

259
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,120
but it's a remarkable experience.

260
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,760
Ayal, you transition to the United States,

261
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,240
you do an MBA at Berkeley,

262
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,240
you're at Cisco,

263
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,320
and you're transitioning from there

264
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,760
towards another startup.

265
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,520
Talk to me a little bit

266
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,000
about that transition,

267
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,040
or if you even want to go before

268
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,080
to another startup you worked at

269
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,640
which was acquired by Cisco.

270
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,000
Sure. So, basically,

271
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,400
since after I left the military,

272
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,320
I went to work for a bunch of start ups.

273
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,960
And I was always, you have to,

274
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,520
and again, now a start up

275
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,920
when at Cisco,

276
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,400
you interview a lot of people.

277
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,360
And you see that some people

278
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,480
are more of startup people

279
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:33,960
and some people

280
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,760
love the bigger companies.

281
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,040
And some people like both.

282
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,240
And there's no right and wrong there.

283
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,640
It's your personality,

284
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,520
what you like doing.

285
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,840
And one of the things

286
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
I always ask people is

287
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,560
that want to join us is,

288
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,520
"Why startup?"

289
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,160
And part of it is just making sure

290
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,600
that they understand what that is,

291
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,520
and part of it to make sure

292
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
it's a good fit.

293
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,920
And I, again,

294
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,840
maybe it was that experience.

295
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,800
Maybe it was just [--].

296
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,280
I knew that startups was probably

297
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,040
the right thing for me.

298
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,200
I end up working for a few startups.

299
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,000
Very early in my career

300
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,640
I worked for a startup

301
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,280
that got acquired by IBM.

302
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,760
And that even reinforced

303
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,400
my thinking that a big company

304
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,320
is probably not for me.

305
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,600
Even though, again,

306
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,080
I think IBM was very, again,

307
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,120
there's a lot of great things to say

308
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,280
about IBM, but the culture

309
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,800
wasn't a great fit for me at the time.

310
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,520
And then I decided to come here to the US

311
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,640
and basically get my MBA at Berkeley.

312
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,360
And that was to me,

313
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,960
a way to move to the Bay Area

314
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,040
where everything happens.

315
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,280
It was a really really great way

316
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,880
to come in.

317
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,480
Obviously, somebody that grew up

318
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,680
in Israel and worked in Israeli,

319
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,760
it was tech companies

320
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,160
that most of the business in the US.

321
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,400
But I didn't really have

322
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,200
a strong US network.

323
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,400
And this was just a great way

324
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,280
to come to the Bay Area,

325
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,400
build a network here.

326
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,400
That was an amazing,

327
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,880
amazing experience.

328
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,760
And after doing that,

329
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,440
I worked at a couple of startups

330
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,360
here in the US.

331
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,880
The second one I worked for

332
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,760
was a company called OpenDNS,

333
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,320
and about a year in

334
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,360
we got acquired by Cisco.

335
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,600
And again, I remember getting the email

336
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,200
from the CEO saying Cisco is acquiring us.

337
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,520
It was I think why I woke up

338
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,680
very early that morning

339
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,960
and [--], the email in my inbox

340
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,080
and I remember thinking,

341
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,480
it's going to be the IBM experience

342
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,080
all over again.

343
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,280
But it ended up being amazing.

344
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,160
Cisco is very very good

345
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,480
at acquiring companies.

346
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,680
I think it's one of the companies

347
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,000
that acquired the most companies

348
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,920
went through the most M&A ever,

349
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,960
and it was just a phenomenal experience.

350
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,640
And it got me the view

351
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,560
of what it's like to work

352
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,560
in this very very large organization.

353
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,560
And again, I can talk a lot

354
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,920
about how well the merged

355
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,080
that's  into the organization

356
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,600
and how our CEO ended up becoming

357
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,760
the head of SVP and GM

358
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,600
for security at Cisco.

359
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,520
What is one thing that you experience

360
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,160
which was very positive

361
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,880
in the mergers and acquisitions?

362
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,520
because a lot of the people

363
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,400
that I talked to on the show,

364
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,240
they've gone through these

365
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,320
different mergers and acquisitions,

366
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,840
it sounds like the majority of them

367
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,880
aren't as successful

368
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,680
as people hope them to be, right?

369
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,360
And obviously, it's extremely difficult

370
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,400
and complicated process, not just

371
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,640
technologically and professionally,

372
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,960
but also in terms of the culture.

373
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,200
Because you're going from a small startup,

374
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,360
even a hundred people is tiny

375
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,920
compared to thousands of people

376
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,400
at a large organization

377
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,320
when all of a sudden

378
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,320
you have a new identity.

379
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,600
So, what was one thing that

380
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,960
you found really helpful

381
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,880
in your transition?

382
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,480
The one thing I think

383
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,640
Cisco did very very well,

384
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
and I think IBM

385
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,600
that's where they missed,

386
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,800
Cisco basically gave us the autonomy

387
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,640
and they didn't come in and told us,

388
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,680
"This is what you need to do."

389
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,920
"You need to change everything

390
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,880
to be Cisco."

391
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,080
And again, eventually it happened

392
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,760
over a number of years.

393
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,720
But they came in

394
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,560
and nothing changed in the beginning.

395
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,560
We still had our

396
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,080
the same reporting structure,

397
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,000
we still had the autonomy that we had.

398
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,800
There were a lot of things,

399
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,560
I'm sure very difficult for Cisco

400
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,240
to agree to

401
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,920
because they were very different

402
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,560
than how they do things.

403
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,160
I'm sorry.

404
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,160
But they didn't really change any of that.

405
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,280
They allowed us to continue

406
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,280
doing everything as we did.

407
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,040
And to some extent

408
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,400
that their approach was,

409
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,720
"You guys have built something

410
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,640
very very successful."

411
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,360
"You guys are doing something amazing."

412
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,680
"We want to come in and learn from you."

413
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,400
And they changed a lot of their,

414
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,120
what I did there was I was running

415
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,960
the product management organization

416
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,400
for Umbrella, which was

417
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,480
the leading product that we had.

418
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,560
And they were basically saying,

419
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,560
"We want to learn from you."

420
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,040
"How do you guide from product?"

421
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,280
And I ended up getting a bunch

422
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,480
of other product groups

423
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,720
reporting into me from Cisco.

424
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,720
This I-can't-say group

425
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,920
ended up reporting into my organization.

426
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,520
They basically said,

427
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,000
"You guys know how to do this?"

428
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,840
"Because you are

429
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,240
a very very successful company."

430
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,320
Which, again, was I think,

431
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,240
was a very very smart way

432
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,920
of doing things.

433
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,360
Right.

434
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,480
So then, you're transitioning from Cisco.

435
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,960
And I'd love to make sure

436
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,320
we have enough time to also talk about

437
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,040
the current startup that you're running.

438
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,760
Because now you've transitioned after

439
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,760
being at a few startups,

440
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,120
being at a few corporate,

441
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,280
being a commander in the IDF,

442
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,240
you're now starting your own company.

443
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,120
So, tell me a little bit about

444
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,440
Anjuna Security

445
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,080
and some of the insights

446
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,600
that you've gained

447
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,280
throughout the process

448
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,200
of starting this company.

449
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,760
Sure. So, I guess due to a lot

450
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,480
of what I did throughout my career

451
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,120
was getting ready for this.

452
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,080
I always knew I wanted to start

453
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,040
my own company.

454
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,000
And a lot of what I did

455
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,040
was geared to that.

456
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,440
Even in my MBA,

457
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,120
I did my internship at a VC firm

458
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,920
just to see the other side of the table

459
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,240
looks like and learn from that.

460
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,000
So, after Cisco,

461
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,480
I went to a VP Product

462
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,440
series A startup at the time,

463
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
series B startup now.

464
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,520
I have to see what it's like to be

465
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,600
an executive at a startup

466
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,790
and get that experience as well.

467
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,640
Very cool.

468
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,600
And then my time there

469
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,480
was cut short

470
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,120
because a friend of mine that I knew

471
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,880
from the Israeli intelligence days,

472
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,680
he was actually a teacher at the course

473
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,200
I was a commander of,

474
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,160
he reached out to me

475
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,400
and he just finished his PhD at Stanford

476
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,200
working with Professor Dan Boneh

477
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,520
that you might know.

478
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,720
Of course.

479
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,920
So, he basically researched this,

480
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,160
it's funny, it was this huge huge

481
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,600
security problem that we both knew about

482
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,480
in the Israeli military intelligence

483
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,920
and to say it in one sentence is that,

484
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,160
you can't secure data

485
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,720
and use it at the same time.

486
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,120
Every time data is being used,

487
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,240
it's essentially not,

488
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,720
it's not being secured

489
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,720
because it has to be

490
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,240
in the clearing memory.

491
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,840
And I ran into that problem

492
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,000
again and again throughout

493
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,160
going in the private sector

494
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,960
as well as at Cisco,

495
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,800
in a lot of places

496
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,920
I ran into how big that problem was.

497
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,160
And he actually found a solution

498
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,920
for that problem during his PhD

499
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,320
with Dan Boneh.

500
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,560
So, we ended up joining forces

501
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,680
and starting a company

502
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,800
to actually solve this problem.

503
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,800
Wow. So, you became a co-founder

504
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,280
of this company, right?

505
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,240
And you joined.

506
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,600
So, what's actually happening now?

507
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,120
Where is the company in the life cycle

508
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,360
of a traditional startup?

509
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,440
So, this was about

510
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,320
two and a half years ago.

511
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,600
The first thing we did

512
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,120
was start talking to

513
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,760
as many potential customers

514
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,160
as it's possible to somewhat understand

515
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,560
if we got the right problem.

516
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,240
Once we had enough information,

517
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,360
we basically built a deck

518
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,840
and started pitching this to investors.

519
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,480
We ended up getting both a seed round.

520
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,640
So we raised our dollar seed

521
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,560
as well as got into Y Combinator.

522
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,120
Amazing.

523
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,460
And when we did that at the time

524
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,000
it was the same week that we got

525
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,760
the term sheet for the investment

526
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,440
and the call from YC.

527
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,560
It was a good week.

528
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,200
It was a good week.

529
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,440
After a very difficult couple of months

530
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,520
it was a very good week.

531
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,920
And yes, since then, we grew the company.

532
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,160
We raised a significant series A.

533
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,560
And we're now basically

534
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,940
a company of 20 people.

535
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,600
Wow. That's incredible.

536
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,000
Tell me a little bit about Y Combinator,

537
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,840
because that's something

538
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,400
that almost every startup seize

539
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,200
as the glory of programs to go through

540
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,240
to accelerate your growth.

541
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,520
What was that experience like

542
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,720
going through it?

543
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,560
Yeah. YC is amazing.

544
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,800
It's basically a startup school.

545
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,560
It's obviously it helped

546
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,280
the company a lot,

547
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,640
but what YC is very very good at

548
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,320
is making sure you know what to focus on.

549
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,800
That you focus on the right things

550
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,760
and that you only focus

551
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,400
on the right things.

552
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,440
And they're just amazing

553
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,240
at making you do that.

554
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,680
So, it's obviously a great experience

555
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,800
for the company.

556
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,640
But it's also an amazing school

557
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,840
for me as an entrepreneur.

558
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,920
Just to doing it is very very different

559
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,160
than seeing it from the sidelines.

560
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,000
And again, I've seen it from the,

561
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,520
I was part of it as an exec,

562
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,760
I was part of it as an employee,

563
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,000
I was looking at it from the outside,

564
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,640
I was doing the internship at a VC,

565
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:13,400
but nothing helps you get actually ready

566
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,520
and really understanding

567
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,920
what you're going to go through

568
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,720
as an entrepreneur.

569
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,680
And the one thing that does the best

570
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,080
is YC are really doing

571
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,160
a really really great job.

572
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,240
And the last thing that YC is doing is,

573
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,960
and I think you probably heard this a lot,

574
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,480
this is not becoming a cliche,

575
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,040
but being an entrepreneur

576
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,400
is an extremely lonely job.

577
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,600
There's really no one

578
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,840
that you can talk to.

579
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,760
The again, the investors

580
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,520
you have a great relationship

581
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,320
you can talk to about a lot of things,

582
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,760
but again, you need to be very thoughtful

583
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,520
about what you tell them

584
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,480
and how you tell them things.

585
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,720
If you very existential,

586
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,200
you don't really share things like that.

587
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,400
And the same with your employees, right?

588
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,200
You want to shield them

589
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,960
with a lot of these ups and downs

590
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,000
that you might be experiencing.

591
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,320
And what's nice about what YC

592
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,920
is that you get this cohort

593
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,280
of other founders,

594
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,440
that you can share all these things with

595
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,280
that is extremely extremely helpful.

596
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,760
Right. 100%.

597
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,400
So, what was probably

598
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,040
the most helpful event within YC?

599
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,160
Was it the network

600
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,000
that you were creating there?

601
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,280
Was it the goal setting?

602
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,040
I mean, I'm guessing

603
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,560
that it was primarily the founding team

604
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,560
that took part of it, right?

605
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,000
Not necessarily

606
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,760
the rest of the employees as actively.

607
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,040
No. It was just me and my co-founder.

608
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,520
And we started YC extremely early

609
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,600
in the company's journey, again,

610
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,760
as we were getting the term sheet

611
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,520
for the seed,

612
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,960
we got into YC the same week.

613
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,560
And YC is essentially

614
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,640
only for the founders.

615
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,920
And it was me and my co-founder

616
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,840
that went through this.

617
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,280
In terms of what we got from it,

618
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,560
one is, the YC network is phenomenal.

619
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,880
If you're part of the YC network

620
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,040
you can pretty much,

621
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,040
it's like we email the founders of Airbnb

622
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,920
and got a response back within minutes.

623
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,320
It's just this amazing network

624
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,040
of founders.

625
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,440
It is just phenomenal.

626
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,640
And also, YC continues, and again

627
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,480
they helped us understand

628
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,680
what we need to focus on,

629
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,240
make sure we're focused on it.

630
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:21,920
You work with two partners

631
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,720
throughout the program

632
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,400
and they help you reach the milestones

633
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,440
that you need to reach.

634
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,120
But also they continue to help you

635
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,760
after you come out of YC.

636
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,360
And you're still part of the network.

637
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,560
You can still do office hours.

638
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,240
You can still talk to people

639
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,360
whenever you want.

640
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,600
Plus they have these

641
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,760
growth programs as well.

642
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,560
They have something called

643
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,840
the series A program

644
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,840
that we actually didn't go through.

645
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,720
We actually are lucky

646
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,980
to be [--] for our series A.

647
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,200
But they do help companies

648
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,460
in raising their series A

649
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,960
and getting ready to raise their series A.

650
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,520
They also have a growth program

651
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,400
that help companies

652
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,200
once they reach about 50 people

653
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,040
growing the company since then.

654
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,360
So, YC keeps helping you

655
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,000
throughout the lifecycle of the company.

656
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,240
And obviously they've seen probably

657
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,040
more startups than anyone else.

658
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,720
So they can do a really good job

659
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,120
at helping you there.

660
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,170
And that's just phenomenal.

661
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,560
Ayal, best of luck with the startup.

662
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,880
It sounds incredible.

663
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,160
And I just love this journey

664
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,200
that you went on.

665
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,760
And you really got to taste

666
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,640
so many different parts

667
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
of the tech ecosystem.

668
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,040
And the fact that you're saying that

669
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,520
a lot of these experiences

670
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,080
were geared towards preparing you

671
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,440
for this incredible journey

672
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,320
that you're on now,

673
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,000
I think that's just really awesome way

674
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,760
of looking at it.

675
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,280
And the way that you are talking

676
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,800
about your experience

677
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,680
as the commander of that course

678
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,520
in the IDF,

679
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,040
I think it totally resonates.

680
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,320
And I think it's part of the magic

681
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,840
of startup nation, part of the magic

682
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,240
that also Eric Schmidt talks about a lot.

683
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,320
And the book, obviously,

684
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,240
Startup Nation talks about

685
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,280
that it's this innovation

686
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,400
through necessity.

687
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,600
And when you think about commanding

688
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
a course in the IDF,

689
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,800
you don't necessarily think about,

690
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,760
you think about

691
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,040
the professional side of it

692
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,840
and the mentorship,

693
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,920
but you're presenting

694
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,040
this whole other side of

695
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,760
you had to innovate your network,

696
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,600
to innovate politics in order to make sure

697
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,360
that this works.

698
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,320
Ayal, before we leave,

699
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,760
I want to thank you

700
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,320
for being so generous of your time.

701
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,360
What are three words

702
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,520
that you would use to describe yourself?

703
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,520
Sure. So, well, you gave me a minute

704
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,040
before we started to think, so yeah.

705
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,160
I think that the three words

706
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,920
I would use are, one is passionate.

707
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,760
Number two is curious.

708
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
And I really believe in the

709
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,200
student always mentality.

710
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,840
I think you can always get better.

711
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,960
You can always learn more.

712
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,980
And I love learning new things.

713
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:39,160
And the last one is empathetic.

714
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,080
Why is that?

715
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,760
Explain that a little bit more.

716
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,720
I think one of the best things,

717
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,000
especially CEO

718
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,440
regardless if he is a manager,

719
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,960
but definitely as an entrepreneur,

720
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,320
the one important thing you build

721
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,280
is not actually the product,

722
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,920
it's the company.

723
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,440
And a huge piece of building a company

724
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,840
is the culture that you build.

725
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,800
And one of the things

726
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,360
I'm focusing on the most

727
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,000
is how do I build the right culture.

728
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,880
How do I build a culture

729
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,880
that I would want to be a part of.

730
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,240
And again, working for a lot of startups

731
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,400
I've seen better cultures

732
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,920
and worst cultures.

733
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,400
And it got me thinking a lot about

734
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,600
what culture I want to build.

735
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,960
And I want to have a place

736
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,760
where people enjoy being a part of it.

737
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,080
And to me it's all about, I think,

738
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,000
I actually have a little story,

739
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,320
which I think is he best way

740
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,480
to think about this.

741
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,880
I was lucky to meet Eric Yuan,

742
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,800
the founder of Zoom

743
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,800
on a couple of occasions

744
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,280
and small group settings.

745
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,480
And he talks about the culture

746
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,200
that he's building.

747
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,280
And he see all these companies

748
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,160
with the company values,

749
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,760
the seven things they put on the wall

750
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,600
and it's like super,

751
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,360
I think nobody nobody reads it,

752
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,200
nobody remembers it.

753
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,600
He said, and we adopted it

754
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,200
that are in Anjuna as well,

755
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,880
he said the one company value

756
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,240
that they have, is care.

757
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,040
He said it's caring about the employees,

758
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,240
caring about the customers,

759
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,120
caring about your investors.

760
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,040
So, it's the one thing.

761
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,280
And every time I go back

762
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,640
decision to make,

763
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,800
I go back to that

764
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,640
and thinking about that.

765
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
And I think that's an extremely

766
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,680
important piece of building a company.

767
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,020
Wonderful.

768
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,560
Ayal, thank you very much.

769
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,080
Toda raba.

770
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,240
This was just that wonderful.

771
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,360
Best of luck.

772
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,120
Thank you.

773
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,640
Best of luck to you.

774
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,040
Bye bye.
