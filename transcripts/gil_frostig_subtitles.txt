1 Gil Frostig. Thank you so much for being on 20-minute Leaders. My pleasure. So good to have you. And we used to seeing you once a month on the J-Ventures at the J-Ventures monthly meeting where you're also an LP. So now we have to do this, And now we have to do this online like this. But actually you're more than an LP at J-Ventures By the way, you're actually taking a much more of a Chief Technology role. Correct? Yeah, I'm pretty active there. I'd like to --to be a sort of a chief technology officer of the fund like J-Ventures? What does that even mean? That makes me very proud actually. I really like the whole concept of J-Ventures. It used to be called J-Angels prior to that. I think it's a model of a VC second to none. There are some things here which are so unique and we're going to do great business on one hand but Also at the same time, we're going to build a culture of the community that is going to be first of its kind. A capitalistic Kibbutz. I've been feeling that sentence from quite a few people. Gil, we only have 19 minutes left. I'm already upset. So much to cover. You worked at Intel since graduating from the Technnion. Spent 30 years there. Climbed the ladder of success from an entry-level chip designer to a VP. Moved off onto Qualcomm. Built products that emerged as number one in the market of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. You're going to explain to me what that means. And now you're in Silicon Valley. One of the most well-respected advisors, board members, and investors. Take me back. Technion. You graduated and you're entering Intel. What is that like spending 30 years of the company and climbing up the ladder of success? Well first of all, Intel has been a fantastic company for me. It is a big company, so actually I got opportunities here and there. Okay. It was always under you know for 30 years, it was under under the Intel umbrella, I call it. But they were very different things. So I did start as the chip design guy in Haifa. And over time, I moved to the US and I got a great opportunity to be Co-GM of the business unit there. And this really opened a lot of opportunities for me. And I was I guess very lucky which is a big part of the story. What is it like fighting for those ranks? Because you know at least you know young entrepreneurs like myself all we hear about is, "Yeah, you could join a company like Intel, IBM, Google, etc. And slowly climb the ladder but that's really hard. Why don't you go, do a start-up. Get acquired maybe and then just join as a director." I mean talk me about your experience... I don't think there's one answer which fits everyone. Okay. Michael: Yeah. Some people are really born to be in startups. Okay, this is their personality. Of course, we know the percentage of successes of startups. Somebody wants to try and you know generate some calculation. They may but it doesn't mean anything. Did you know, did you think you're going to get to where you got to at Intel? I get opportunities which were far better than my dreams. I can tell you that. That's incredible. Yeah and I'm really grateful for that. And you know I started as young engineer. There were very good people around me. Okay. And this gave me a huge push through teamwork. Okay. Which I meant Israel was built on the shoulders of several you know very good people who just created the culture. And we were helping each other. And it was just a fantastic stuff for my career. And then actually, people in Haifa helped me get to the opportunity I got. It's Intel in the US. It's southern Oregon in the LAN business. Okay. And I got to be a Co-GM there which was phenomenal experience for me. OGM isn't? Sorry? OGM. What is that? Co-GM. Co-GM. Okay. Co-General Manager. Installed that's in a box. So, I was mostly the operations and the engineering person. and I had a person and I had a partner who was mostly marketing, and sales. and together, we build the strategy, and working on the budgets and the leadership of the organization. We actually grew in our organization which was about $250 billion over three years in the late 90s to become a $1 billion dollar organization. And so you know each person can have opportunities different places and excel in different places-- Not that many you know. They say that if you want to run a billion-dollar business, You should go and be an entrepreneur because that's the really doing it. But no, you went you know the Intel route and you still got to manage a billion-dollar business. Wow. One of the other fortunes was that they never worked on the x86 processor at Intel. I always worked on other businesses which were new to Intel. So we built a you know billion-dollar, this business out of networking LANs, a LAN solutions. Then our team, my partner and I were assigned to build this new protocol nobody heard of which was Wi-fi. Wi-fi. I heard of that before. Yeah. I mean people try to Yeah. people people try to have wireless solutions for a long time. But this was the right time definitely. And we can come up. Michael: Just to get a context, we are talking about the inception, the years where the Internet is born because you know talking to somebody like me, I don't know what that means. But there was a period where the Internet needed to be born and I get to be speaking now to one of the pioneers who got it out to the world. Okay. I love by that. I think the Internet's really start to spread around in mid- 90s. And in the late 90's, we were assigned go and implement this you know new wireless protocol. Then the folks who worked in Israel on chips for plans. I said, "Hey, can you do the same thing just without the wider?" And what always the engineer say? "Of course we can." So this was '98 or '99. And by 2003, we came out with a solution Wi-Fi into the Intel platform which was called Centrino. Again, you need to be half a dinosaur to remember that name. It became a real success. So this was actually together not only the engineering efforts But also all the marketing efforts and the market creation effort. This was actually the one product and the one brand which opened up the Wi-Fi market. And later on, it was so gratifying to see people who they just need Wi-Fi as the same as they need oxygen to some extent. Okay. It became so pervasive. You know actually Gil you mentioned that I was in Kilimanjaro a year ago, exactly a year ago with my dad my brother. We were up on the mountain and we didn't have Wi-Fi but we had oxygen. And at some point, I was thinking what do I want more right now? And I didn't have my Wi-Fi for a week and I didn't know what I valued more. Right. So this is very rewarding you know to see how successful this became. So I was just you know fortunate to be part of that team which was a scientist started. We started something on the side. You know for Intel suddenly they decided to have it as one of the key components on the platform. Wait, that was a side project? it started as a side project? Yeah. It was something on the side for this LAN division. Maybe they can do something out of it. and then the CEO of Intel realized that, "You know what? This could be one of the key stone's here for a new type of platform for Intel," where we brand not only the processor but we brand several elements of the platform - the processor, the networking, the chips, the memory. You know things of that nature. And with all the additional efforts on the marketing side, it became you know a big hit. And this actually opened the entire Wi-Fi market up here. What do you learn from that? so having gone through this experience, you know I can look at it in the textbook and see, "Okay, so this is one of the key innovations that really transform people's lives." You experienced it. so what do you learn about, what can you teach me about organizations or about you know innovation, and entrepreneurship from this example of this Wi-Fi technology being born out of these circumstances? Yeah. so I think there are sometimes cases were somebody high there start something without knowing even if it's going to be something we're not and you have to try that. We also tried VSL and it didn't go anywhere. We also tried the cable modem solutions for the PC and it didn't go anywhere. but we've tried Wi-Fi, we started Wi-Fi and at some point in time, there was a key strategic decision by the CEO. So this was, in my opinion, an example where CEO can decide on some strategy which really makes a difference. Okay. And because of that, from something on the side, we just joined the eye of the storm. Okay. and we had weekly meetings with the CEO to make sure everything is on track. With the CEO of Intel? Yeah. Wow. I mean the chipset, and the processor, and our solution, and everything else. And you know PC platform is something pretty complex. And you don't want to be the guy who's going to delay the new rollout of a new platform. But it was you know and then there was also another element not about the design which was about enabling the market. so the marketing team came and said, "we're going to build outside places, coffee shops. You know 400 of them that will be utilizing Wi-Fi." So the CEO looked at them and said, "why 400? why not 4,000?" Okay. And this was so meaningful. and yes, they got the 4,000 and it really went terrifically from there. And other companies also grew up in that area. Some of them thank Intel today because they became rich too. Wow. Gil: yeah. Very close. Admirable. And what does that mean in building the platform that at the end gets number one market share in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi technologies? Well, this comes to you know your work as a team and is it P&L. So the trick in big companies like Intel. They put people in business units. People have a lot of affinity to their own businesses And they wanted to succeed in the marketplace. I've told you a story actually about our Gigabit Ethernet controller. Okay. LAN controller which we built around the same time and we competed head to head with Broadcom. It was huge battle. Okay. And it was just about the question of who can do faster, who can do develop it faster and high quality. At the end of it, I remember till today Dell was the king of the hill and PC's at that time. And we wanted really bad to win Dell and so did Broadcom. And the design went changed places at Dell between Intel and Broadcom five times. Last and fifth time was Intel. Okay. This was one of the best days of my career. Okay. especially when you take into account a guy who ran Broadcom at the time, Henry Nicholas and his eccentric behavior. You can write about it, you can read about it in the media, in the gossip columns, wherever you want to see it. But it was a huge, huge win. Wow. That's just incredible. and Gil, you transition from this then to, and you transition from that to Silicon Valley helping companies, helping both early and late stage companies succeed both at GigCapital where you're a strategic advisor but also as part of J-Ventures. So why is that? because you go from these huge, huge corporations. 30 years. VP at intel. VP at Qualcomm and all of a sudden, you're working with startups. Yeah, so I've been in the Valley here for 20 years. I still work here for Intel quite a bit and for Qualcomm. But since the day I got here, I start to get involved with startups. I still found the time. get engaged with startups. Usually, they came through my personal network, friends. Okay, people from me Israel or something like that. and because I missed that. I really wanted to learn more about that and help where I keep where I could. And I found some great startups and great people to work with. And over time, I also learned to trade by doing so. At some point in time, I decided this is about two three years ago. I decided, "okay, corporate America was great for me. I'm thankful And I want to do everything around startups going forward." okay. And I just you know I left. I went to pitch events, pitching nights between San Jose and San Francisco every day in different place just to meet more people. see more startups. And what I learned see which one I can actually helped. You know I started to be an advisor. Many of them investor of several [inaudible]. And then I had you know, then I found with Odesk for money and J-Angels as were called at the time. And this is you know a bunch of great people. Some of them are VC's in the day job. Some of them are CEO's who were successful in driving their companies' exits. Corporate people. So it's a great mix. And right now, I feel more comfortable investing through or with J-Ventures because I think we're really doing a good job here on due diligence side as well as on the connection side. You know we're having 60 members right now. and people are very connected. And we can not only be investing and making money out of it But to actually help the startups that we invest in. Through the connections, we have people in the Valley and we have people around the world as well. So this became a very, very qualities expense for me. I am mostly, most of the my time is about startups. I met two new startups today, earlier. Okay. And it's it's wonderful. Michael: I love it. --nominal ideas. Okay. you see great people and you can help them. What could be better? tell me. A 100 percent no. But Gil, are you still in the you know hardcore networking scene or are you now branching out to other things as well? I did branch out a lot. Networking is one field. if I can help there, it's great. But over the last 20 years, I really learned a lot of things which are you know relevant to many ,many types of startups. Could be Fintech. Could be biotech. Med tech. Okay. Really lots of areas. Now if I don't have anything smart to tell them, I don't tell them anything but there's some experience which you know plays by now and I can help really a lot of guys. So you know give me some of those earned secrets over the years both as you know in corporate America but also as a start-up advisor and a strategic investor. What are some the most important things to keep in mind especially now considering the times that we're at now? And let's say for early-stage startups, what is it the common thing that you see come out of both that of J-Ventures and other startups that you see that some phenomenas? Yeah. So there has to be some good differentiation. Now differentiation could be in the technology or could be in the marketing of it or wherever. But if you don't come with something which is really new and gain you lot of momentum relative to the competition, it's going to be very tough. It's going to be very, very tough. People who are open to feedback. Okay. sometimes they need to fizzle it. They come with the fizzle to their startups. And you know what? It's a great idea. I mean not having your people every three weeks. But you know you listen to the market. You listen to customers. Listen to other people. You still have you know the initial strength. That's you and your team That you can say, "hey, you know what? It could be more applicable here and I have also some connections or this investor given more connections in their area. Okay. So if they keep flexibility, it helps a lot. Right. And I mean you know a lot of the startups [inaudible] in a ventures, a lot of them are early stage and you can always assume that. and throughout the lifetime of this company, which hopefully will end in success. There's going to be quite a few pivots. So a big part of also the due diligence is understanding who are the founders behind this [inaudible] up to now. And are they flexible to pivot when necessary. Let's say like in times of COVID-19? Yes and the founders have to be very also open to learning new things because if they are first time CEO or first time CTO, they have to understand the script and how it evolves over time. You know things like a lot of presentation. So I sit a lot of companies on their presentation or you know before angels or VC's. They tend to talk a lot about the technology. They tend give a big, big background of how the world is changing, what are the new trends while these things could be known already or too deep technically. And you have to be a businessman. Okay. You have to understand that the financials that you do here or you plan here should be very, very clear and substantiate it. Okay. And the entire story of how you raise funds and all the ins and outs that people really care when they're investors. Yeah, your personal story could be nice. But don't spend time on it. Don't spend time on it. These are businesspeople who sit in front of you. They want to see how you, they're going to make 10X on your startup. It's not cynical. It's a very good, It's a very good test. Okay. For you as well. And you have to understand the rules and get into this you know very, very quickly. Otherwise, you're going to be in love in some of your slides which are not that relevant. Are you going to get waste people's time? And then, you will not going to have enough time to explain the important things. So after two years of J- Ventures, after seeing 200 startups in the last three years, I actually wrote my own lists of slides and what the investor care about. And I sit with CEO's and help them understand what they need to present, how do you need to present it. Don't need to rush. Speaking too quickly. Okay. There's a lot to learn. and you get one shot. You get one shot. That's it. It has to be perfect. Sometimes people tend to wing it and think "that's okay, my invention is so smart. everybody will get it." The answer is no, they will not get it unless you really, really simplify it and explain it slowly. I love it. Gil, I love it. I love it. I love it. But we have to we have to finish, okay. It's 20 minutes already. I have the most important question for you. Three words that you would best describe yourself as or as anybody at J-Ventures would describe you, Frostig. Okay. So I would say first of all, grateful. Okay. Finally. First of all grateful. I think I've had a hundred episodes. I don't remember grateful as being a word yet. Okay. the other one is I love people. And I enjoy working with them. okay. It's just you know just a dream for me. And the other thing is try to be as thorough as possible in this environment. Okay. Definitely. Gil, such a pleasure. And thank you for all everything that you're teaching me at J-Ventures and here. And then, I look forward to maintaining this relationship in learning more from you. Thank you very much. Gil: All right. Thank you. Thank you for the stage here. [Jewish language]
