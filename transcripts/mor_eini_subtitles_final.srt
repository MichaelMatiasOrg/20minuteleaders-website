1
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,760
Mor Eini, thank you

2
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,600
for joining me on my show.

3
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,760
How are you?

4
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,560
I'm very good.

5
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,440
Thank you very much for inviting me.

6
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,280
So actually, you're I think

7
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,200
my first guest

8
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,760
that's talking from Europe

9
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,000
right now, right?

10
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,880
Yes. At the moment I'm based in Berlin.

11
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,720
Based in Berlin.

12
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,680
Okay. Well, that's quite

13
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,840
an interesting experience

14
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,200
to be there during covid

15
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,280
even though I believe that Berlin

16
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,760
actually managed pretty well

17
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,240
right from the get go, right?

18
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,760
Mm hmm. Definitely.

19
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,880
Actually, here it feels like

20
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,920
we're almost back to the old normal.

21
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,680
Really? Okay.

22
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,520
Well that's very different

23
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,520
from my usual base,

24
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,680
which is either in California

25
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,960
or Tel Aviv.

26
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,040
Both these places right now.

27
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,880
But this will, it'll take a few weeks

28
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,160
until we publish this.

29
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,880
So, let's hope that

30
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,840
everywhere will be great.

31
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,080
Mor, you're based in Berlin.

32
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,840
You're working for APX

33
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,520
strategy and partnerships

34
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,200
one of the leading early stage

35
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,280
venture capitals and accelerators.

36
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,320
And you're running

37
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,000
relationships and strategy.

38
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,480
So, talk to me a little bit about

39
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,080
what you're doing at APX,

40
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,960
how you even got to Berlin,

41
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,360
and then I'd love to go

42
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,560
a little higher, 30,000 feet in the air

43
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,200
and talk about the European ecosystem

44
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,840
for startups.

45
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,560
So actually you ask one question,

46
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,520
but with like 10 different questions.

47
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,120
100%. I love doing that.

48
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,280
I will try, as a good Israeli,

49
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,640
I will try to answer all your question

50
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,600
and provide the answers

51
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,800
that actually I wanna give

52
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,120
and information that I wanna give.

53
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
So, let's see how it works.

54
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,160
If I forgot anything, just let me know.

55
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,840
Sounds great.

56
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,960
What is APX in general?

57
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,320
APX is a joint venture of Axel Springer,

58
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,240
which is the biggest

59
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,480
European media publisher actually.

60
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,440
Not many people know,

61
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,160
and to our Israeli audience,

62
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,940
they actually bought ...

63
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,207
Oh, wow.

64
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:17,800
Yes.

65
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,460
So of course

66
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,640
there is an Israeli connection.

67
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,880
Actually, it's a very well known

68
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,600
German company.

69
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,120
It always supports Israel

70
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,760
since long long time ago.

71
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,000
And together with Porsche,

72
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,880
which is the German automotive OEM

73
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,600
luxury sports car.

74
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,480
And actually, I started there

75
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,920
while I was managing

76
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,520
their partnership with Facebook

77
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,600
which is, I would say,

78
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,800
quite an interesting partnership.

79
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,000
What is that partnership? How is Facebook connecting to

80
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,120
the startup ecosystem over there?

81
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,480
So actually Facebook has this kind of like

82
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,720
it's called the Facebook accelerator.

83
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,960
It exists all over Europe

84
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,800
and also in Israel, in Berlin,

85
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,360
or in Germany or in ...

86
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,120
I don't know how we wanna call it,

87
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,520
we were their local partners.

88
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,400
So, actually the aim was to see

89
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,200
how we can help Facebook

90
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,760
integrate their technologies

91
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,560
into startups.

92
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
So, we’re not talking here about ads

93
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,120
or managing campaign ads,

94
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,500
but actually more of like

95
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,080
a bit more well-advanced technologies

96
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:27,040
like AR, VR, messenger, and AI.

97
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,640
So, we had quite an interesting journey.

98
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,200
It was twelve weeks working

99
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,440
with C-Levels of I would say

100
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,200
early stage startups,

101
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,400
but not that early.

102
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,720
So, that was what I was doing

103
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,400
for the last six months.

104
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,760
And then recently,

105
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,160
I stayed and shifted my position

106
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,960
a little bit towards

107
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,440
strategic partnership and growth.

108
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,640
And just to make it, keep it simple

109
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,240
So basically, my job is to understand

110
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,760
how I position APX, not only Europe wise

111
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,480
as the leading early stage investor,

112
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,800
but also in Israel and other ecosystems.

113
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,320
And in parallel to that,

114
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,400
to create business opportunities

115
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,120
for our portfolio that is currently

116
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,360
with over 50 companies

117
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,140
from actually, all over the world.

118
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,360
That's awesome. Okay.

119
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,800
So what does that mean,

120
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,840
how do you go about

121
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,640
and taking a VC or an accelerator,

122
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,400
and taking it from Europe

123
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,960
and trying to get it based in Israel

124
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,400
and trying to get in on the good deals

125
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,700
and become a well-known brand

126
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,920
so that Israeli start-ups,

127
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,360
instead of going to some of the other

128
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,920
well-known VCs,

129
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,560
they would consider going to APX

130
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,840
for their seed or series A?

131
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,240
If you have the answers,

132
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,640
please let me know.

133
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,580
Because that's actually

134
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,960
what I'm trying to do.

135
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,160
But in a nutshell,

136
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,720
maybe it's also connected to who I am

137
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,280
and where I'm coming from.

138
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,040
So, I'm originally Israeli.

139
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,680
Was born and raised in Israel.

140
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,640
Was working quite a lot

141
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,560
in the Israeli ecosystem.

142
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,680
You were working with mobility, right?

143
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,400
Yes. I started my career

144
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,200
with EcoMotion,

145
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,520
which is the biggest smart mobility

146
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,000
community in Israel.

147
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,120
And later on, I worked for Hubraum

148
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,560
which is the seed investment vehicle

149
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,800
of Deutsche Telekom.

150
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,920
So, I guess I always had

151
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,880
a German kind of like bug inside of me.

152
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,040
And then after, yeah

153
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,520
after those positions, I decided

154
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,640
okay, it's about time to see

155
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,840
what else out there,

156
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,720
outside of the Israeli ecosystem bubble

157
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,280
which is very comfortable.

158
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:34,800
But I felt

159
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,200
it was too comfortable for me.

160
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,280
And I believe

161
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,800
in actually creating value.

162
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,960
I mean, I'm in my core,

163
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,280
I'm a community manager.

164
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,640
That's how I started.

165
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,200
And I believe

166
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,200
that to create a fruitful ecosystem or

167
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,720
to create a really meaningful community,

168
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,400
you need to provide value

169
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,440
not only to the members,

170
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,920
but also to people that are trying to see

171
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,880
how they can partner with the community.

172
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,920
And that's exactly

173
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,840
how I see this position as well.

174
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,600
I feel like okay it's, APX,

175
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,880
it's a joint venture

176
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,280
of two well-known names

177
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,500
I would say

178
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,680
not only in the German ecosystem,

179
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,120
but in the worldwide ecosystem

180
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,600
if I can call it that way.

181
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,840
But what makes us different

182
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,520
than other VCs or other programs

183
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
that are out there,

184
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,500
and it's actually the value

185
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,600
that we can provide to the companies.

186
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,660
And I think that,

187
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,860
although we have this corona crisis

188
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,720
and it might be more challenging

189
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,120
to raise money,

190
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,880
but good companies will approach VCs

191
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,800
that not only can give them the money,

192
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,880
but can also give them the connection.

193
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,280
And the, I would say,

194
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,000
the unique selling point.

195
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,440
It can be connections.

196
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,480
It can be, I don't know,

197
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,040
good advice or feedback or support,

198
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,880
helping them to get new customers.

199
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,640
And that's what I'm trying to do

200
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,920
in the position

201
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,440
because we do provide money,

202
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,400
but what else do we provide?

203
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:04,880
Amazing. So I'm fairly comfortable

204
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,680
within the Silicon Valley ecosystem,

205
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,920
the Tel Aviv ecosystem

206
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,160
in terms of how startups operate

207
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,240
and the different stages

208
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,880
that they go through.

209
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,800
I'm very excited to go

210
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,720
on that journey myself pretty soon

211
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,440
in both fields.

212
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,160
But I know nothing about

213
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,960
the European ecosystem,

214
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,160
and obviously some say

215
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,680
that Israel is part of Europe,

216
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,080
but the real European ecosystem

217
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,920
and Germany and in Berlin

218
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,640
and the places that you get to work at,

219
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,020
how do startups operate there?

220
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,040
Is it different than in Palo Alto

221
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,040
or Tel Aviv?

222
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,240
Is there a different mindset?

223
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,200
Are the investment stages the same?

224
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Talk to me a little bit about that.

225
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,280
So first of all, when you say Europe,

226
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,920
I mean, it's pretty challenging

227
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,680
to say Europe

228
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,760
and then try to generalize it

229
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,640
because you can't.

230
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,198
Yeah. I'm sure.

231
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:50,440
Even in Germany,

232
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,600
the Berlin ecosystem

233
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,680
doesn't look like the ecosystem

234
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,400
in Munich or in Frankfurt.

235
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,940
So maybe, if we will,

236
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,480
that's why when I talk to startups

237
00:14:59,480 --> 00:14:59,960
and they're like,

238
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,960
"Yeah, we see Europe is

239
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,840
our next destination."

240
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,760
I'm like, "Okay, what is Europe?

241
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,120
Is it UK?

242
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,960
Is it France?

243
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,160
Is it the Netherlands?

244
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,040
Maybe we're talking about Poland"

245
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,640
Is it mostly cultural norms

246
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,900
or professional norms that are different?

247
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,960
I think it's all together,

248
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,800
but one thing I can say that I think

249
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,720
that if you manage to conquer Germany

250
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,760
in a way, you as a startup

251
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,120
have a good reputation

252
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,640
because Germany is well known

253
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,360
to being a bit of a tough market here

254
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,920
I think not only for foreign startups,

255
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,400
but also, for German startups themself.

256
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,520
I will now, maybe very much generalize it

257
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,320
just for the sake of the conversation,

258
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,080
but it goes a bit deeper than that.

259
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,720
But Germans, if I would say

260
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,620
put it like that, compared to Israelis,

261
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,760
are less tend to take risks.

262
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,120
And if a small company from Israel

263
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,120
come and say, knock on the door and say,

264
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,040
"Hey, hello.

265
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,440
We have this great technology.

266
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,880
We've been to 8200.

267
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,080
I'm sure you heard about us.

268
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,880
You know, we're going to revolutionize

269
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:12,040
the way that you are protecting your data.

270
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,840
Let me show you how we do it."

271
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,740
So, don't be surprised if they say,

272
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,260
if they're very polite and say,

273
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,520
"Thank you, but we don't need you

274
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,520
at the moment."

275
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,360
Or they don't even bother

276
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,720
to answer the e-mail.

277
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,600
So, I think what's really important

278
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,520
in Germany, is actually to make sure

279
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,120
that when you come here,

280
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,360
you know exactly what is it

281
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,520
that you wanna get.

282
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:37,480
You are pretty stable finance-wise,

283
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,560
but also have the capacity

284
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,680
to actually deliver what it is

285
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,000
that you promise.

286
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,680
And I know that in the Israel ecosystem,

287
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,240
we always say,

288
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,380
"Of course, we can do it.

289
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,560
In 14 days, you will have it."

290
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,320
But when you come here,

291
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,820
you can't say 14 days

292
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,520
and then deliver it in six months.

293
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:55,960
Yeah.

294
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
It doesn't work like that.

295
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,640
And you need to come

296
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,240
when you have ...

297
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,360
When you have invoices.

298
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:00,840
When you are like,

299
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,480
Okay, that's what I was doing so far.

300
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,040
Now, here, that's how I see

301
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,680
how I can optimize that

302
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,480
or help you to achieve that.

303
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,360
Don't try to find

304
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,280
how you are going to change

305
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,600
the entire structure

306
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,620
because Germans also don’t like changes.

307
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,240
For years, their economy's working.

308
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,680
The industry is moving.

309
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,520
You can't come there

310
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,920
and promise them something

311
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,120
that you both know

312
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,550
you won't be able to deliver.

313
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,200
So, try to be a bit modest

314
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,360
I would say.

315
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,520
And also, come prepared

316
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,830
that it's going to take

317
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,880
be a long process.

318
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,440
But, the minute you manage to create

319
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,510
this confidence,

320
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,560
so they will see you

321
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,310
as a long-term client or costumer

322
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,080
And actually you're going to walk

323
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,590
this road together for a long time.

324
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,000
And I guess, that's what's also different

325
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,030
than US.

326
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,360
Right. So, both in the US and in Israel,

327
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,720
it's also very accepted

328
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,880
that big corporates

329
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,520
are partners with startups

330
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,000
and they're very supportive of startups.

331
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,840
Not only do they have

332
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,200
often venture arms

333
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,310
to invest in startups,

334
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,560
but they often bring them in

335
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,160
and do these initial contracts

336
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,920
pretty leniently.

337
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,400
Similarly, C-level executives

338
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,360
in a lot of these companies

339
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,760
are angel investors themselves

340
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,240
or they sit on the boards

341
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,440
of startups themselves.

342
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,560
Is that existent

343
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,920
in the German ecosystem?

344
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,720
Do German corporates have an arm?

345
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
Do they help startups?

346
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,680
Do the executives invest

347
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
and sit on the boards?

348
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,750
Or is that different as well?

349
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,800
So actually

350
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,790
it's a very interesting question.

351
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,750
And I think that in Israel,

352
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,040
it's very small ecosystem

353
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,200
and it has its own rules,

354
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,270
but it's also a bit far away

355
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,750
from the headquarters.

356
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,320
And eventually,

357
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,680
when you approach this corporate,

358
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,280
you start with playing

359
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,160
in the Israeli ecosystem

360
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,800
but it does not promise

361
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,600
that you will take a core part

362
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,200
in what the mission or strategy

363
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,270
of the headquarters.

364
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,030
And that's what I was doing in Hubraum

365
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,240
in Deutsche Telekom.

366
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,960
I was basically

367
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,160
their woman on the ground

368
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,720
and helped to source startups

369
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,320
that might be potentially

370
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,270
strategically relevant for Hubraum.

371
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,080
And I can tell you,

372
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,640
it's super challenging.

373
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,160
Eventually you need to understand

374
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,640
what the strategy

375
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,760
that the corporate need,

376
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,560
not even now,

377
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,260
maybe in two, three years.

378
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,080
And then to understand

379
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,680
who within this corporate

380
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,720
will be able to lead you in this,

381
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,400
I would say,

382
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,000
very sometimes complicated roads

383
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,070
within the corporate.

384
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,040
And actually, that's something

385
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,200
that I was trying to solve here,

386
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,240
because I realized

387
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,040
that we, the Israeli ecosystem,

388
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,240
I think it's amazing

389
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,270
the way it helps and provides support

390
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,240
and knowledge sharing

391
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,640
to all the members,

392
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,400
all the different members

393
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,120
of the ecosystem.

394
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,550
And here in Berlin,

395
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,550
I felt it was a bit missing.

396
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,200
It's also important to say that

397
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,320
it's not like you cannot really compare

398
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,680
the Israeli ecosystem in Berlin

399
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,880
to the one in Silicon Valley

400
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,440
or in London in other places,

401
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,240
because it wasn't that developed.

402
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,960
Only in the like few last years

403
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,320
you can see more and more Israelis

404
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,400
that actually comes here

405
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,680
to work in startups

406
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,960
and to work with big companies

407
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,750
and big corporate.

408
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,840
And together with a friend and a partner,

409
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,070
we created here a community

410
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,310
for Israelis in tech and business,

411
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,640
and the aim was actually to create

412
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,720
this small Israeli ecosystem

413
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,120
where you create connection,

414
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,070
helps to network, and provide tip, advice,

415
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,200
or even just support to anyone who needs.

416
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,160
So we have more than 200 members

417
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,560
coming from different corporates

418
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,160
in Germany,

419
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,280
startups, governments,

420
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,960
Israeli companies that are based here

421
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,840
because, indeed,

422
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,160
it's very very tough sometimes

423
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,480
to come into this market and say,

424
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,550
"Hey, okay, what's next?"

425
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,720
And sometimes you just need

426
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,040
to hear a little Hebrew

427
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,750
and to have a little fun and have it be with friends.

428
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,200
But Mor why are you doing this?

429
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,320
Because it sounds very complicated.

430
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,550
It sounds tough.

431
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,160
It sounds like

432
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,040
this is a developing area that

433
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,240
there's a lot of,

434
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,320
you really have to understand

435
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,200
the different players.

436
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,920
And it's not necessarily as open yet

437
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,640
as in a lot of other areas.

438
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,560
Why are you over there instead of

439
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,160
being in Silicon Valley or in Tel Aviv?

440
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,600
It's an interesting question

441
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,800
and I sometimes ask myself

442
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,790
the same question.

443
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,480
What happened?

444
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,840
Like you could stay in Tel Aviv,

445
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,240
and do your thing

446
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,200
and everything will be fine.

447
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,080
And you won't have to struggle

448
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,900
with Germans

449
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,000
and with the language

450
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,400
and with the culture.

451
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,200
But I think that those

452
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,360
outside of comfort zone spaces

453
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,590
where you can grow the most.

454
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,560
I mean, the level of connections

455
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,320
and experience that I gained here

456
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,000
in less than three years, is tremendous.

457
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,720
I don't think I could ever

458
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,720
be able to create something like that

459
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,550
not only in Israel,

460
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,880
but in other places that are

461
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,640
maybe a bit more mature

462
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,110
than the ecosystem here.

463
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,760
And I think that that also gives me

464
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,960
an opportunity to grow

465
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,000
within the ecosystem

466
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,600
and actually to position myself

467
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,240
in a place that I can create new things

468
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,880
and initiate different projects

469
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,310
that actually no one saw before.

470
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,340
And I can say that

471
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,760
many of the things that I was doing

472
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,640
is something it's like those things

473
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,240
that I got from the Israeli ecosystem

474
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,550
and the way we work.

475
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,600
And it's super fun.

476
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,320
I feel it's like,

477
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,070
okay, it's a new playground.

478
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,550
I bring my skills,

479
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,680
but I also had the experience

480
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,040
and the opportunity to learn

481
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,760
and get to know other culture

482
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,840
which in the world of today,

483
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,520
I think it's something you can't learn

484
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,420
through computer

485
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,920
or with making video calls.

486
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,080
You actually have to be here

487
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,240
and understand

488
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,440
how this ecosystem operates

489
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,680
and also how different people create

490
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,920
different kind of businesses

491
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,040
and relations.

492
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,320
And sometimes when I'm visiting Israel,

493
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,600
I need to do this shift in mind.

494
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,280
I'm like, okay. Here, you don't cue.

495
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,680
You need to go from that side

496
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,000
or to be a bit more louder

497
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,960
if you wanna get what it is

498
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,040
that you want.

499
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,520
So, it's a different mindset

500
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,700
and it's like, for me,

501
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,840
amazing to get this exposure

502
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,880
to what I'm having here.

503
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,120
And also, to be this channel

504
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,080
when Israeli companies or people

505
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,400
that also want to experience,

506
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,320
I can be that person that say,

507
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,310
"Hey, you can do that

508
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,440
and that" because

509
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,120
it's something that I myself did it.

510
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,000
That's so so cool.

511
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,120
So, did covid hit the German ecosystem

512
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,040
the same way that it hit the other world

513
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,120
in terms of everybody

514
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,320
going to remote working

515
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,550
and startups having troubles

516
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,240
raising money?

517
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,080
Was it a similar thing in your area?

518
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,680
I would say yes and no.

519
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,760
I think that here,

520
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,160
we need to divide it

521
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,040
also to different aspects.

522
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,720
I think that the German government

523
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,600
was well prepared

524
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,830
to what is about to come.

525
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:53,200
Many startups, or many not only startups,

526
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
many companies in general

527
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,880
in the German industry, have

528
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,590
what is called ...

529
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,590
which is the company still exist

530
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:04,600
and the government pays 60% to 70%

531
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,200
of the employees' salary.

532
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,800
So, the companies didn't fire anyone.

533
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,310
People are still working.

534
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,830
Yes, and I think that's amazing.

535
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,790
So, the economy is still moving.

536
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,790
And I think that create

537
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,550
a bit less stressful situation.

538
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,080
I can tell you that at APX,

539
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,280
we actually invested

540
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,360
in more than five companies

541
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,180
during since, I would say,

542
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,550
corona started hit us all

543
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,200
in the beginning of March.

544
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,960
So, we continue to invest money

545
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,200
in startups.

546
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,520
We also see that, I mean,

547
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,440
it's not that corona hit

548
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,350
and then suddenly you stop everything.

549
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,560
Some of the process started

550
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,880
before that.

551
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,880
So, in for many of those giant companies

552
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,960
and big big companies,

553
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,480
it's not like a matter of

554
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,480
Okay, in a month or two,

555
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,160
I'm going to change my entire strategy

556
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,720
something that the budget and the plan

557
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,480
was deployed long time ago.

558
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,120
So, you keep moving.

559
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,240
Some of the companies actually said,

560
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,680
"Okay, we're not going to hire

561
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,920
new people at the moment."

562
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,240
But, the ecosystem is still moving.

563
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,640
Like everyone else,

564
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,720
we adapted ourself to be in an online world,

565
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,280
but I have to admit that last week,

566
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,880
I was actually in a physical event.

567
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,680
Wow.

568
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,160
Yes.

569
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,200
That's a little scary in my mind.

570
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,140
I have to

571
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,520
one of the things

572
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,800
that I was contemplating with friends

573
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,920
was that we're watching Netflix now.

574
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,520
And all of a sudden

575
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,680
you see in the movie

576
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,560
two people hugging or shaking hands.

577
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:31,840
And I'm like,

578
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,800
"Oh my God! Look,

579
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,550
no, you can't!"

580
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,360
There's a pandemic!"

581
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,800
What are you doing?"

582
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,000
So I think

583
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,640
it's a really interesting thing

584
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,040
that's happening now.

585
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,200
But Mor, do you see yourself long-term

586
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,920
in this relationship between

587
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,790
Germany and Israel?

588
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,200
Or is this something that, you're like,

589
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,080
Wow. I had this amazing five years.

590
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,440
Now I'm ready to go

591
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,640
now I'm ready to go back to Tel Aviv

592
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,830
or to my next country for an adventure.

593
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,600
So maybe I should ask you that question.

594
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,520
If someone would ask you like

595
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,520
like six months ago,

596
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,440
would you ever imagine

597
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,160
that we will have no flights?

598
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,880
We won't be able to leave our home.

599
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,000
And restaurants or bar

600
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
are going to be closed.

601
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,350
Would you imagine that?

602
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,520
So, I guess not.

603
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,980
And I guess that's life.

604
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,590
For me, it feels like,

605
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,590
I can plan and decide

606
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,400
how is it that I see my future,

607
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,240
or what I'm going to do in five years,

608
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,340
but reality prove us

609
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,640
that we can't plan that long.

610
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,280
So at the moment, I'm having fun,

611
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,310
and I feel that I'm being challenged

612
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,640
and learn new things.

613
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,480
And actually, I can grow here.

614
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,960
At some point,

615
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,000
I know myself,

616
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,780
I need to change.

617
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:42,000
And whenever I feel too comfortable,

618
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,960
I know that it's about time to leave.

619
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,350
So, when I feel like that, maybe

620
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,280
I will make the change.

621
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,350
But let's see, I guess.

622
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,280
Wonderful.

623
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,160
Mor, before we leave.

624
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,080
I wanna ask,

625
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,440
you get to see all these startups

626
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,000
and you get to see

627
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,350
these different ecosystems.

628
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,720
Do you notice any things that are perhaps

629
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,080
lagging in terms of the ecosystem

630
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,740
that you're in?

631
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,480
Some technologies

632
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,640
that we already consider mainstream

633
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,800
in different parts of the world

634
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,760
that are potential opportunities

635
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,920
for young entrepreneurs

636
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,200
who are considering their next steps

637
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,120
and maybe there's a good opportunity

638
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,040
in Europe or specifically in Germany?

639
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,320
So I think in general,

640
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,480
the startup material here

641
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,760
is a bit different than what you see

642
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,880
maybe I'll say in Tel Aviv

643
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,160
because I'm not very familiar

644
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,520
with what's going on in Silicon Valley.

645
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,120
Here, and I would be precise

646
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,110
and say Berlin,

647
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,400
because I don't wanna talk

648
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,420
about the rest of Germany

649
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,080
because as I mentioned,

650
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,440
it's a bit different.

651
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,240
Startups here

652
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,350
are less technology innovative,

653
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,360
but more of like, business model

654
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,880
or product innovative.

655
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,590
You can see a lot of consumer products.

656
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,520
A lot of B2C, which is actually

657
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,160
quite interesting.

658
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,240
In Israel, you can see a lot of deep tech.

659
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,800
So, companies that it will take them

660
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,920
five to seven years until we will

661
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,640
or very very long life cycles of sales

662
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,350
until you can actually see something.

663
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,790
And here, it's a bit different.

664
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,240
I mean, you can see that the big unicorns,

665
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,320
the German unicorns,

666
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,550
are marketplaces for cars

667
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,920
Auto Eins.

668
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,520
Zalando which is the German ASOS.

669
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,000
Get Your Guide which is marketplace

670
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,520
for travelling or tourism.

671
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,000
And it's not by accident.

672
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,600
I mean, you need,

673
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,520
that's what I'm saying that

674
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,000
I don't think it's a different world,

675
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,080
but the way technology perceived here

676
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,880
is a bit different

677
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,200
than what we see in Israel.

678
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,640
In Israel, we are very much used to say,

679
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,520
Okay, we're going to change the way

680
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,120
that we drive our car,

681
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,360
and everything is super super

682
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,040
technology oriented.

683
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,110
We're here to be different,

684
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,160
but you can also see the success

685
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,960
very fast of those products,

686
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,240
or the failures.

687
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,160
So, I would say that

688
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,830
I think it's a great place.

689
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:00,400
To come here after you have some,

690
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,360
I would say, product validation

691
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,280
and technology validation.

692
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,960
But it's not a very good place

693
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,920
for experimentation.

694
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,920
So I would recommend,

695
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,680
unless you are very like mobility

696
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,880
and then like all the OEM and tier ones,

697
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,560
this is a perfect place for you.

698
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,360
And also depends which

699
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,400
what is it in mobility that you are doing.

700
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,400
Come here when you already have

701
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,440
some funding, product market fit,

702
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,720
a bit more stability in the company,

703
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,720
and maybe my tip will actually be

704
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,880
to have someone that is physical here

705
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,680
although we all live in Zoom.

706
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,310
I think that with Germans,

707
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,360
it's very very important

708
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,590
to have someone on the ground

709
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,000
that you can contact with.

710
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,400
And if he's German and local,

711
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,520
it's sometimes even better.

712
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,700
Because although we say,

713
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,720
"Yeah, we are Swiss knives Israelis.

714
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,200
We can do everything everywhere."

715
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,680
It's crucial to have someone here

716
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,880
and if that someone speaks German,

717
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,760
and not only the language

718
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,680
but the culture,

719
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,760
I guess your life will be easier.

720
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,700
That really sounds interesting.

721
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,720
Mor, thank you so much for your time

722
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,760
again for your generosity.

723
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,360
Before we leave, I need three words

724
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,830
that you would use to describe yourself.

725
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,590
So, that's going to be a tricky one.

726
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,830
I'll do my best.

727
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,360
So, I would say,

728
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,280
Israeli.

729
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,760
Redhead.

730
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,760
And white wine.

731
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,520
Israeli, redhead, and white wine.

732
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,520
I love it.

733
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,400
Mor, toda raba.

734
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,120
Thank you very much

735
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,940
and best of luck with everything.

736
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,680
danke schön

737
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,160
Bye bye. Thank you.

738
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,640
Bye.
