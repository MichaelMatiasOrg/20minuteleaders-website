1 This is something that technology cannot solve on its own. You have to had much more empathy and compassion and insight into the human psychology. Really understanding the emotional barriers that go into people like, having difficulty to change their behavior. And what are the mechanics that you can build into that. Michal Levin, thank you for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? I'm great, how are you? Happy holidays. Happy holidays to you, too. I'm so excited to talk about user experience with you. Like I mentioned, I didn't get to talk to it about nearly enough in the 300 episodes we've had. And I'm super excited to dig deep into the importance of user experience and in everything we do, both in tech and startups, but in daily life as well. And before we get started, I have to say your experience with UX is remarkable. I think that I saw about a dozen different organizations that you've made an impact on in the world of UX all the way from a startup like Zoox to a Google, to Verily, and now Hero. So, tell me a little bit about your journey. How do you even get started with dealing with user experience? Yeah. That's a great question. Those are quite a few years back. Actually, the story starts back in Israel where I was born and raised. And after I finished my army service, I actually join a company. And that's kind of like was my entry to the tech industry. And I actually, join as a QA. And I started working there. And back in the days it was about, what, probably, about 15 to 20 years ago, UX in Israel wasn't an industry. Like there was no education around and there were not a lot of companies that was doing that. It was just like early on where mostly engineers were just like building the UI's based on what they thought was the right thing to do. And I actually remember those early days where I was doing QA and I was testing the functionality of the product. But I kind of started also asking, just like intuitively all this question as to why, you know, why do we have all these menu items, like why does the workflow work like this. And I started just like within the culture of that company. We started talking about this idea of usability and UI super early on. So, that's kind of like was the early, early seeds. Then I actually went to a school and I started Computer Science and Business Management. However, halfway through my degree actually decided that computer science is not what I want to continue doing. I didn't see myself just like, you know, exiting and coding. I really wanted to see how I can bring more people to focus creative doing into kind of like what I do in my career. So, I paused. I started exploring, kind of like what I want to do next. And I ended up actually going on to multiple route of psychology and communication as one bachelor degree. And I also continued my business management as a parallel path. And I continued with these two bachelor degrees. And I really enjoyed it. But then kind of like as I was studying, I was like, okay, what am I going to do with all these degrees, like, what does that translate to. And while I was in school, I kind of like went back to this like, oh, you know, there was this UX thing that I kind of like started back then and I think super interesting. And it made me feel like this could be something that I'm good at that really brings together this like the cognitive psychology with technology. So honestly, what I ended up doing is one evening, I just opened Google and I just search for all the UX companies in Israel and I just applied to all of them. I wrote a cover letter explaining why I think bring I value to that company. And I just like throw it out there. A couple of companies got back to me. I got an interview process and luckily enough, I landed in TZUR, which was kind of like one of the top design agencies in Israel. And that was actually my entry point. So, you go into an agency, it's just like all about, like having a lot of UX people there. I worked there for almost four years and I think I built a lot of just like hands on experience and understanding, working with dozens and dozens of clients across so many different platforms, you know, mobile and web and TV and across like media and finance and gaming. And that gave me, like, so much experience with that. So, yeah. So, that kind of like how I started. From there, I actually joined Modu, which was founded by Dov Moran, one of the top entrepreneurs in Israel. And during my work at Modu, actually nine months into my work there, I was approached by Google. And a funny story was that I had a doubt like I don't want to pursue that. Like I was very happy at Modu. And then a friend of mine said like, "What are you saying? Are you crazy? You know, get started, go through the hiring process. You can always say no at the end." So, I started. And it ended up being a really long process. It was about seven months of hiring process because it was the first UX hire in UX Israel. So, I had like, 14 interviews across, like around the world, on [--]. Yeah. But during that time, seven months of interviewing, you start getting excited about the opportunity. And it feels kind of like this psychological connection and I ended up getting hired. And this is how I started my Google journey, which really kind of like a company in over the following decade. I spent six and a half years with Google. I moved to the US, through Google. I worked at Verily, and now I'm at Hero. Unbelievable. I have to give the analogy. I never wanted to be a pilot. My father was a pilot. And when it came down to going to do the army testing which we do in Israel, of course, you know, I said, okay. You know, they're inviting me to try. I knew that I didn't want to be a pilot. And but all my friends said, "Well, Michael, you have to try. Like, you know, it's like, you have to see if you can make it." And I remember they sent me to the [--]. It was one of the worst weeks of my life. And I'm traumatized by it until today because it was so difficult. By the end of it when I was accepted, it was so hard to say no. Even though I didn't want to be a pilot, I felt like I just had to do it because I got through it. As if it does mean to myself. But I have to give that analogy, And I think you set it on. You said that they hired you now, you said yes. That's what I think it's, it more comes down to, from what I'm gathering from the story. Michal, break it down for me. User experience. You mentioned the psychology, communication, computer science, disintegration of understanding user behavior. Break it down for me. What is user experience and why is it so fascinating to you? Yeah. That's a good question. I think, at the end of the day, you know, it's kind of like it's starting with understanding why are we doing these things, you know. You start with the why. I think that's going to, like one title commonly associated with Simon Sinek, I think I kind of like very much relate to that. It's really like starting to think about what you're doing and what you're building by truly understanding what people need, what are their pain points, what are their mental models, behavior weaknesses, where the psychology really kind of like going deep into understanding what is the problem that you're trying to solve, what are the common barriers, what are the pain points. And really starting from their needs and goals, doing that analysis really understanding the people and the audiences that you are trying to to solve the problem for, and go from there. So, it's not about starting with the technology and everything we can do because the technology can do X and can do Y, which is what we call a tech driven approach. It's a user centered approach. Like, let's understand, what do people even need and then see what is the best way to do that. And again, it doesn't mean that we necessarily need to do all the fancy stuff. We really need to hone in on what are the key needs. I think a good example for that and for that kind of like how it manifests itself, i actually think the last couple of years working in healthcare is a really great example. Michal, new background, new environment, same user experience, same question. Talking about health care a little bit from your experience as well. Why is your expertise with health care an interesting example of the importance of user experience? Yeah, I think it's a really great example of the difference between technology focused approach and user centered approach. Because, you know, there's a lot of promising technologies and things that we can do. Machine learning and AI, and we can build all these amazing tools and do sophisticated things. But when you actually try to innovate within healthcare, what you realize that oftentimes when you try to build tools for like health systems physicians, the secret and what would actually get you to change and move the needle is how well you can integrate into their existing workflows. So, if you stop building all these amazing tools, but they're actually a separate tool that they need to log into that, they need to open it, they need to learn. that is a huge barrier for adaption. And oftentimes innovation would come by like finding the ways that you can integrate into their EHR. And even if the EHR UX is not great, this is where they're at. And you need to find the creative ways of integrating yourself there, and being in it as part of the workflows and seeing how through there you can bring value to them. So, oftentimes it's not necessarily, like all the amazing, beautiful technology that we can build independently is really finding their way to tapping your cells into their busy schedule and really understanding that they have like, five minutes a day to take a look at these things. And if you want to squeeze yourself within their daily routine, it's not going to be with building a whole other tool outside of their kind of like habits. I think that's a fascinating example. Because, you know, it's the entrepreneurial mindset of any, especially young entrepreneur is saying, Okay, we have this idea and we want to make it all around beautiful products that are all login screen and are all user experience. And we're so excited to show this on encompassing product when if we forget a little bit about the customer that at the that needs to use the product and what their behavior is and how are we fitting into their behavior, then we might have this crazy misalignments where nobody can even use your product because you're not aligning to what they actually need. Why isn't the engineer in the room or the project manager in the room enough to understand this? Why is there a specific role called user experience Why is there this function within a company? Why isn't it enough that engineers just think critically about their customers and just adapt to that? Yeah. It's a great question,. And I would start by saying that again, like the culture that I've been raised on and I truly believe in. It's not like that the UX person is the only one that solves all the problems. I think it's like continuously collaborative process where we work together, engineering and product and UX bringing all the considerations together, thinking through user problems. I think it's important across the organization, whether you're a product manager, engineer, regulatory person, to have a shared understanding of what are we building, why we're building, who are our user. So, I think this is actually something that culturally we need to be shared. I think in terms of like when do we need it like, why do we need a dedicated role? I think it's just that a full time job to do that work well. And at the end of the day, it's just like any role. Like, why do we need PGMs? Like, can't a PM be a PGM? In some scenarios, yes. Like, people can build that skillset. I think it's just like at the end of the day, like, you have a limited bandwidth, there's work to be done. And if you want to do it well, you need dedicated resources that can have the bandwidth to do it. So, if a PM needs to, like a PM can also code. Why not them the engineers? Well, because if they need to have to code, they going to need to spend half the day on it so, they don't have the time to collect the business requirements and do like landscape analysis and talk to customers. So, I don't think it's necessarily like people that have like a specific super power that others cannot learn or gain. It's more about how do you build a healthy organization where you put your resources on the key things that have to be, you know, super thoughtful, go deep and truly understand, so, we do build the best product. I think that's fascinating. And one of the things that I'm always asking myself\ in the context of user experience is the way that I think about user experience to some degree is thinking, okay, we have this intuition about how we should approach solving the problem for our users. And user experience professionals can help us navigate that intuition into practicality and research data driven analysis of what actually do our users needed, how do actually can we use our intuition to navigate there. And one of the things that I'm always asking myself is how do you even know that there's a problem. Right? How do you know that if I have a hundred functions within a company and I'm guessing within Google and Verily, in those different companies you've been a part of, there were many, many aspects where user experience was important. How can the CEO, the engineer or the product manager, even pinpoint the parts where a user experience professional may be of use? Yeah. Well, i think kind of like as you said, it starts with like research and really understanding what we're trying to solve. So, I think every entrepreneur, every CEO, every product manager, they usually start their initiative by observing a problem. By observing an unsolved need or a need that is not being solved well enough. And then in order for you to tackle differently, so, you sometimes if you went to this personally, you already have some insights around what you experience is being like the key barriers or the key gaps. If you're trying now to say, okay, how do we build a scaled product out of that, you need to do kind of go deeper to say, how much is your experience actually applicable more broadly. You want to understand what are the target audience that apply to that. And there's a lot of research that needs to go into understanding more deeply what does that intake. So, again, like, where are the problem's coming from, what are people's expectations. As well as, you know, in an ongoing way, as you develop the product, whether it's based on your intuitions and kind of like your ideas, you want to validate that. And again, you need people that can go and thoughtfully do that. So, you know, there's like different approaches. Often times people just think that they can go to people and say, Would you like this feature? Would you find this feature useful? Which, again, kind of like for a lot of people, it feels like intuitive to do. But that actually doesn't generate and like any viable results. Because whenever you ask anybody if they want this or that, they will usually say yes. Because why not if they can get more. But there's a lot more that goes into it because what you end up seeing that people use maybe 10% of the features that you offer them, because at the end of the day, would they actually use the product. Then there's trade offs whether in terms of complexity and time and all those things, they're not going to use it. So, you do need to have particular skills to do the research well. So, you gain the right insight that you can rely on. Also, you really want to have, kind of like, holistic approach to look at qualitative data and quantitative data. And again, doing all of that, it takes time, requires expertise. Also, how do you design things well. Like how the whole there's a whole, like, investment now. And this is an area that I'm also like, super excited about is like this whole idea of behavior change. And I think that's another angle that to me represents how important UX is. Because we see it again in healthcare but everywhere. You can build all the most amazing devices, whether it's wearables or like all of the crazy stuff that we see that is amazing. But between having an amazing device and getting people to use it every day, there is a big, big gap. Right? This is why we see that like obesity is like more prevalent than ever. And like changing behavior of the people is so so hard. I think this is where, this is something that technology cannot solve on its own. Like, you have to have much more empathy and compassion and insight into the human psychology, really understanding the emotional barriers that go into people kind of like having difficulty to change their behavior and what are the mechanics that you can build into that. So to me, that's another area where I see healthcare like UX is critical. To really change people behavior and scale, it's still an unresolved problem. UX is critical. And I think this is what I see a lot of the value that comes by really going deep on these areas. It's fascinating beyond belief. I just read a really interesting article by one of my former bosses, Kristen Berman from the Irrational Lab. One of Dan Ariely's projects. And he was talking about the vaccine. Like thinking about the covid-19 vaccine and the user experience behind that whole distribution. And now, we were in this situation where we need like 75% of the world to take this shot voluntarily in order to resolve this pandemic. And it's fascinating, I think. Thinking of behavioral economics and help. And you see prime ministers going on live television doing it themselves. Like that's a part of the user experience journey. Right? And I'm really wondering, sometimes, how much thought really is put into these critical, critical things. I have a hunch that it's not enough. And we need more people like you to help advise these [--]. But that's fascinating. Michal, we don't have much time. But give me a few key insight nuggets for the young entrepreneur of how to approach solving user experience issues or intuitions as they build a company, whether it's for B2B or B2C, doesn't really matter. Yeah. That could be a topic for an entire conversation. I think I would go back to kind of like where I started. It starts with why. And I think this is also, when I interview UX people, when I look for UX people, I start with looking at their critical thinking and their problem solving skills before the visual aesthetic and the ability to design a screen well. You really want to have people that keep asking why. Really understanding like, why are we doing that, why are we doing it this way, can we simplify it. Like really keep asking this why. And it's pretty interesting. I have two toddlers and I think those behaviors, they ask why like 10 times on everything. They go, but why, but why, but why. And you know, as a parent it would sometimes be challenging. But I think that's the right mindset. And I think over time along the way, we start asking those deep whys. But I think that those whys and going like three whys in, you know, the first principle approach. Really understanding why we need a certain things and how can we do it better. I think this is where innovation starts from. So, that would be kind of like my top advice in terms of the mindset. Because I think it starts with the mindset. And the more you ask those why, I think this is where you start thinking about things differently. The other thing I would say is what I think like personal experience is many times provides good intuition as to where we need to go. We do need to remind ourselves that you are not the user in most cases. So, we need to be humble, we need to make sure that we're not making too strong assumptions based on our own experience and take the time to truly try and understand the audience that we are targeting and where they are coming from and what are their challenges and making sure that we have the empathy and we really incorporate that into how we approach the product and we validate and we learn. Because those things are changing all the time. So, yeah. I think that's just inspiring. So, thank you, Michal, for that. Three words that you would use to describe yourself. My favorite question. Okay. So, three words. I'm probably going to, I'm going to cheat a little bit because I'm going to use the two words for each one. But there is a hyphen there so, theoretically speaking, it's one. I think one thing about myself that characterizes me, I think, in everything that I do and also my career is just like people-focused. I think it all starts with the people. Hiring the right people, building the right relationships, being really people focusing, kind of like what people need, how you can grow them, how do we work with them as peers. That's going to be one. The second is growth-minded. I think constantly, like I seek feedback, I seek growth. I want to grow as an individual. I want to grow as a professional. I am a big believer in the approach of atomic habits. Get 1% better every day. And so I really do seek those avenues of growth constantly. And the last thing I would say is daring-greatly. Which is a concept that has kind of become more popular with Brené Brown books, which I absolutely admire. I think she is she's brilliant and she like the type of messages that she's trying to kind of like disseminate are so important on vulnerability and imperfection. But to me, that's kind of like this idea of like being in the arena, fighting, putting in the blood and sweat and failing and overcoming obstacles until kind of like you ideally succeed, but really kind of like not just critique and point from the side of what's not working. But really being there and trying and working hard for worthy outcomes and do your best. I just love that. Michal, thank you so, so much. This was wonderful. I appreciate your time so much. I know how busy you are. And all I can say is stay safe and stay healthy. And thank you for the amazing work that you're doing. Thank you.
