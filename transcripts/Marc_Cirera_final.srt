1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,400
People, I believe are good.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,560
People are good per se.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,040
They want to do good things.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,320
However, sometimes it's not easy

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,120
to do good things.

6
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,000
Sometimes you want to, I don't know,

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,800
you want to plant a tree

8
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,760
but where, how, with who?

9
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,720
How are you going to do it?

10
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,240
And like this, like so many other

11
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,480
initiatives, so many other things

12
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,720
that you might want to do,

13
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,040
and it's difficult.

14
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,920
So, what we want to do is

15
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,880
to make it super easy.

16
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,840
We don't want any excuses

17
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,160
from businesses.

18
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,560
If you want to do good,

19
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,300
tell us how and we will help you.

20
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,960
Marc Cirera, thank you so much

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,120
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,800
How are you?

23
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,240
I'm very good, thank you.

24
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,240
It's still covid-19.

25
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,600
We have the distance for you

26
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,280
and a beautiful Paramount hotel in Dubai.

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,560
And Marc, you are an entrepreneur.

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,000
But you're originally from Barcelona,

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,920
but here you are in Dubai.

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,720
And I can't wait to talk to you

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,000
a little bit about doing good

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,560
for the world

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,600
and helping companies do good.

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,440
So, tell me a little bit about yourself.

35
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,120
And what are you doing here in Dubai?

36
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,680
Sure.

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,720
So, well, I started doing business.

38
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,960
And then at some point, I realized that

39
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,280
I needed something

40
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,640
a bit more meaningful in my life.

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,480
I wanted to make a larger impact

42
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,800
than just making money

43
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,920
for the sake of it.

44
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,640
And so at that point,

45
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,400
I went to Australia

46
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,520
to do a masters in business ethics.

47
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,200
And that really kind of motivated me

48
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,240
to get into this sector

49
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,960
of sustainability, CSR, business ethics.

50
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,840
To help businesses make money

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,240
while doing good.

52
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,800
Right.

53
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,040
But you're originally not from Dubai.

54
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,200
You're still from Barcelona

55
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,360
and you spent some time in Australia,

56
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,584
what brought you to Dubai?

57
00:01:56,585 --> 00:01:58,960
Correct. Love brought me here.

58
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,840
So, before coming here,

59
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,040
I was in London.

60
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,960
I was working there as a CSR consultant.

61
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,120
Then I quit my job.

62
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,520
I left the city,

63
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,360
just was looking for new experiences.

64
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,600
And I went to South America to travel.

65
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,520
And while there,

66
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,800
I met the love of my life,

67
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,240
who she was working here at the time.

68
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,960
And I just followed her here

69
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,600
and here I am now.

70
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:22,960
Beautiful.

71
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,640
And you're raising a family here.

72
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,840
Marc, you're an entrepreneur.

73
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,080
You are a different kind of entrepreneur

74
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,800
because your focus is not just

75
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,720
on taking a business

76
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,320
and growing it exponentially.

77
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,400
Not the regular hockey stick.

78
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,240
But your focus is on doing things

79
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,280
that do good for the environment

80
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,440
and do good for the world

81
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,960
while helping other companies do that.

82
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,080
Tell me a little bit about,

83
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,800
why you're even in this doing good space?

84
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,240
Yes.

85
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,960
So, normally, I don't call myself

86
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,840
an entrepreneur,

87
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:47,960
I call myself a social entrepreneur.

88
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,400
Because for me,

89
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,640
just to starting a business

90
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,080
without having this element

91
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,000
of giving back to society,

92
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,600
it was not really meaningful.

93
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
So, whenever I thought

94
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,520
about creating something,

95
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,120
it was always with this

96
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,480
purpose driven kind of goal.

97
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,320
And so, I created Companies for Good,

98
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,320
which is a social enterprise

99
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,440
and we help businesses do good.

100
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
And as you were saying,

101
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,840
it's not the typical, I would say,

102
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
startup in the sense

103
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,600
that we're not really looking

104
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,920
at growing fast and raising funds

105
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,760
and making it huge.

106
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,400
We're just looking at doing things well

107
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,120
and enjoying the journey as well,

108
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,480
which I think is super important.

109
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,960
I've seen lots of entrepreneurs

110
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,160
suffer a lot

111
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,000
while creating their startups.

112
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,680
And I'm sure you are a witness

113
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,280
of having told with so many people

114
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,920
of how tough the journey can be, right?

115
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,240
And how people sometimes

116
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,040
are always looking for funds

117
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,280
or they are like struggling to

118
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,600
to make things happen.

119
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,440
And so, for me,

120
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,480
that was something very important.

121
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,520
I set three big objectives

122
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,000
when setting up Companies for Good.

123
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,480
One was to make it profitable,

124
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,280
to make money.

125
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,600
One was to make a positive impact

126
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,280
on society and the planet.

127
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,680
And the third one was to have

128
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,280
a good life while doing it.

129
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,680
Good, work, life balance.

130
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,000
So, these were the three

131
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,520
kind of elements

132
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,938
of the startup.

133
00:04:20,138 --> 00:04:20,600
Right.

134
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,960
I think that's a very interesting trend

135
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,840
that we see today.

136
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,920
Unlike a lot of different timelines

137
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,240
in the world,

138
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,960
but now we have social entrepreneurs

139
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,600
that are realizing that

140
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,480
it's not just about, you know,

141
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,520
doing non-profitable work

142
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,240
and just volunteering their time.

143
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,960
But you have to make it

144
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
also, a profitable business.

145
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,840
You have to make

146
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,800
a positive social contribution

147
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,280
to the world

148
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,080
while also having a profitable startup

149
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,480
that can actually generate revenue

150
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,320
and keep sustaining.

151
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,720
Because if you want to make an impact

152
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,240
and I remember I read a quote,

153
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,720
one that really transform me,

154
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,520
if you make an impact

155
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,480
on a billion people,

156
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,960
you also make a billion dollars.

157
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,200
They go hand in hand.

158
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,120
It's not just about doing good.

159
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,440
But it has to be a two way street.

160
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,040
Because it also, you have

161
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,640
to have a good team

162
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,240
that is working on you.

163
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,880
You have to attract

164
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,240
the best talent to work for this.

165
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,880
So, I think that's very inspiring.

166
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,560
Marc, before we go

167
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,800
into Companies for Good more,

168
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,000
I'd love for you to tell me

169
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,560
a little bit about

170
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,160
your experience here in Dubai.

171
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,080
What have you observed in the ecosystem?

172
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,400
You've worked with different companies,

173
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,280
you've seen different VCs and incubators,

174
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,320
what is happening here in Dubai?

175
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,760
There are lots of things happening.

176
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,480
I've seen the startup scene

177
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,680
change a lot in the past five years.

178
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,920
There are so many accelerator programs,

179
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,560
incubators, and generally, like

180
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,360
the ecosystem is growing a lot.

181
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,520
I think it's an amazing place

182
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,498
to start up anything,

183
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,040
any project, any business.

184
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,080
It's a place full of opportunities here.

185
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,440
And so, and it's fairly easy as well

186
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,800
in terms of bureaucracy.

187
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,920
I mean, it's fairly easy

188
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,400
to set up your business

189
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,440
and start operating

190
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,360
and start the invoicing

191
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,000
and start working

192
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,800
within almost hours, sometimes.

193
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,040
That's pretty crazy because

194
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,480
you've had also different experiences

195
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,240
with bureaucracy.

196
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,440
And you've observed different countries

197
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,120
in how they operate.

198
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,120
So, how is that different?

199
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,840
Yes, it's absolutely different.

200
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,640
Before having Companies for Good here,

201
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,280
I had the business back home,

202
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,240
which is Barcelona.

203
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,760
And over there,

204
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,560
the bureaucracy is a nightmare.

205
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,637
It's like, it's so complicated

206
00:06:13,638 --> 00:06:15,160
to set up a business.

207
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,040
It's so costly.

208
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,040
Even before you start operating

209
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,080
you really need to pay

210
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,240
lots of taxes

211
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,440
and you need to pay fees.

212
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,240
And it takes days, if not months

213
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,000
to be able to start working

214
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,080
and start doing something.

215
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,560
And that's really not good

216
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,440
for the entrepreneurs and of ecosystem.

217
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,880
What we need, we are young people

218
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,760
or not so young,

219
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,800
but with lots of ideas

220
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,040
we want to make things happen.

221
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,680
And if the institutions

222
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,120
keep putting all these barriers,

223
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,360
then they're just making things

224
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,560
way more difficult.

225
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:48,800
Right.

226
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,640
So, tell me a little bit

227
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,880
about what's happening with the world.

228
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,640
And, you know,

229
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,920
you're coming in and saying,

230
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,640
you know, we have all these

231
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,880
great organizations that are looking to

232
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,680
have these bonding group experiences,

233
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,640
but while also making

234
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,440
a positive impact on the world.

235
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,080
What is happening to the world

236
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,800
where companies are having this shift,

237
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,480
where they're looking

238
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,920
to have these impactful projects

239
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,560
that you've observed which triggered

240
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,520
you are doing Companies for Good?

241
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,840
Yeah, I think two things are happening.

242
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,600
One is that,

243
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,400
people are more aware nowadays

244
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,880
about things that are not

245
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,560
really going as we would like to

246
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,600
in the world

247
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,320
in terms of like climate change, right?

248
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,880
It's on the agenda of all governments.

249
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,720
Everybody's talking about it.

250
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,160
In terms of social inequalities,

251
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,960
diversity and inclusion.

252
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
There are so many things

253
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,120
that perhaps, in the 70s, 80s,

254
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,120
businesses could just carry on

255
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,440
and people are looking the other way.

256
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,720
But now, it's not happening anymore.

257
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,120
Everybody is way more accountable.

258
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,640
And businesses also,

259
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,560
are more like aware

260
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,320
that they need to do more things.

261
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,440
The other one is that,

262
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:49,800
people, I believe are good.

263
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,960
People, are good per se.

264
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,440
They want to do good things.

265
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,680
However, sometimes it's not easy

266
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,480
to do good things.

267
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,400
Sometimes you want to, I don't know,

268
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,160
you want to plant a tree

269
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,760
but where, how?

270
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,120
With who?

271
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,160
How are you going to do it?

272
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,670
And like these,

273
00:08:02,671 --> 00:08:05,080
like so many other initiatives,

274
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,840
so many other things

275
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,120
that you might want to do

276
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,440
and it's difficult.

277
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,200
So, what we want to do

278
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,280
is to make it super easy.

279
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,200
We don't want any excuses

280
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,520
from businesses.

281
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,960
If you want to do good,

282
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,760
tell us how and we will help you.

283
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,280
So, that's why we're seeing

284
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,520
that people really, and people

285
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,360
and when I mean people,

286
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,040
I mean companies are made by people.

287
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,720
So, when I talk about companies,

288
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,280
I always think about

289
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,530
the people making up those companies.

290
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:30,920
Because I think it happens a lot

291
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,760
that people talk about,

292
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,440
"Oh, Microsoft is this and that."

293
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,560
or I don't know,

294
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,720
that oil company or coca cola, or this.

295
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,400
Sorry, I'm dropping names here.

296
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,600
But these are worldwide.

297
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,160
And who are these brands?

298
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,640
Like I mean, they're just legal names.

299
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,160
And behind those names

300
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,520
there are lots of people.

301
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,000
And lots of different people

302
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,120
who care about different things,

303
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,920
who have families

304
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,520
who live within the planet.

305
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,320
And so, it's those people

306
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
that we're talking to

307
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,880
when we are offering

308
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,360
our support to them in the sense of,

309
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:00,960
how do you want

310
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,160
to make a positive contribution

311
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,280
with your colleagues in this case?

312
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,400
Do you guys want to do something

313
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,240
for the refugee community?

314
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,294
You want to do something for

315
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:10,720
those who are suffering cancer?

316
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,680
Do you want to support children?

317
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,560
Do you want to protect the environment?

318
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,440
So, we know that people care

319
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,520
about those things

320
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,040
and we just give them

321
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,120
the opportunity to do something about it.

322
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,920
So, what it sounds to me

323
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,200
is that you've identified a gap

324
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,800
between a desire that people want.

325
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,760
So, like in economics,

326
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,840
I think the supply and demand,

327
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,520
there's a lot of demand,

328
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,360
there's not really supply

329
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,800
because people might know

330
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,960
that they want to do certain things

331
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,080
but they have no idea

332
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,720
as to how they are going to go do it.

333
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,920
How do I plant a tree?

334
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,360
How do I help families

335
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,440
that are in need?

336
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,040
Right?

337
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,120
And so, you're creating this platform

338
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,080
where you're helping bridge that gap

339
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,800
and saying,

340
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
"You want to do good?

341
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,200
I know how to do the good,

342
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,920
and I can just help you leverage

343
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
the human capital and financial capital

344
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,160
to go and do that."

345
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,640
Give me a broad spectrum

346
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,880
of what types of activities

347
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,480
do you actually do?

348
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,120
And how do you go

349
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,200
about taking companies

350
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,560
and make them happen?

351
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,760
So, in terms of activities,

352
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,960
we have many different ones.

353
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,560
We categorize them between

354
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,280
doing good for the environment

355
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,200
or doing good for the communities.

356
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,880
For the environment,

357
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,440
we do beach cleanups,

358
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,760
we do a tree planting,

359
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,840
we do forest reforestation,

360
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,600
we do under water clean up

361
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,400
with divers on the ocean,

362
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,560
we do clean ups on the desert.

363
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,760
So, we do many different actions

364
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,360
that are about keeping our planet clean

365
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,520
and trying to keep the air

366
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,065
as healthy and possible in terms of like

367
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:28,720
offsetting CO2 emissions.

368
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,600
And then for the communities,

369
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,280
we have activities to support children,

370
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,040
to support people of determination,

371
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,760
which are like people with special needs.

372
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,857
Here, we call them

373
00:10:37,858 --> 00:10:39,320
people of determination.

374
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,640
And with their groups of employees

375
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,640
to go to a center where there are like

376
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,840
children with special needs

377
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,040
and they teach them,

378
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,880
they play with them,

379
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,760
they read books to them, etc.

380
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,320
We have activities to support refugees,

381
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,680
people that are suffering from cancer.

382
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,280
So, many different initiatives

383
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,480
that you can do something

384
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,440
with your colleagues,

385
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,400
and that has a positive impact

386
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,400
on that certain community demanded.

387
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:02,640
Right.

388
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,120
So, what's been the most

389
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,120
both easiest and hardest part

390
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,240
of this journey?

391
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,560
Because I imagine that

392
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,600
every company that you work with,

393
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,400
it's a different challenge,

394
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,160
it's a different flow.

395
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,600
But over you know, you mentioned that

396
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,880
you're doing hundreds of projects.

397
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,680
What's the pattern

398
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,000
of the easiest and the hardest things

399
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,880
that you've had to overcome?

400
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,720
The easiest is to make people happy.

401
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,800
People love doing these things.

402
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,880
And I cannot repeat it enough times.

403
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,920
When we start one of our activities,

404
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,560
everybody arrives, they're be like,

405
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,480
not grumpy, but their level of energy

406
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,880
is not that high.

407
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,840
Some for instance,

408
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,800
let's imagine a beach cleanup. Right?

409
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,160
We say to a company there,

410
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,920
that group of employees

411
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,880
that are coming like, we meet at 9 AM

412
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,960
and we will start.

413
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,000
They arrive at 9 AM

414
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,680
and either sleepy like,

415
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,960
often they don't know their colleagues

416
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,920
or they don't know them much.

417
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,840
Because in the office,

418
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,200
the kind of relationships established

419
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,880
with people might be different

420
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,480
from outside the office, right?

421
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,080
In the office there are lots of hierarchies

422
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,960
or your day to day work,

423
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,640
wherever that is.

424
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,344
So, people don't talk much

425
00:12:04,345 --> 00:12:05,080
among themselves.

426
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,080
They're not really like laughing,

427
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,880
not really engaged.

428
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,640
Time keeps passing,

429
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,120
they keep doing things together.

430
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,800
And then by 11, 12,

431
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,240
when they finish the activity,

432
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,920
they are such a hype there.

433
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,000
The level of energy is huge.

434
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,880
People are laughing.

435
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,200
They're talking on each other much more.

436
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,440
And we ask them afterwards,

437
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,200
you know, like,

438
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,360
"Have you met anyone new?"

439
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,680
"Yeah. We met lots of colleagues

440
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,440
I didn't know."

441
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,080
And they love doing a clean up.

442
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,840
For some people,

443
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,120
only the idea of picking up trash

444
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,560
might be a bit like, I don't know,

445
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,320
there people who work on that.

446
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,000
Why do I need to go and clean up?

447
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,400
But once you're there

448
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,880
and you see that real impact

449
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,200
you are making on nature,

450
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,480
something happens,

451
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,920
something quite magic

452
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,040
that it lifts you up.

453
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,800
They call it "the giver's glow" as well.

454
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,240
It's a bit like, I don't know,

455
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,520
you feel fulfilled, you feel happy,

456
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,680
you feel you've done something good.

457
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,760
And we see that all the time

458
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,840
with the groups that we're taking

459
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,920
to do these kind of activities.

460
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,520
That they end up super excited.

461
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,080
That they end up

462
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,240
obviously much more aware

463
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,360
of the situation,

464
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,160
whether it's environment

465
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,720
or the community.

466
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,200
But it's that feeling

467
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,400
that people have that,

468
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,680
wow, we've done something good.

469
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
We've done it together

470
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,280
and that's exciting.

471
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,200
That's really good.

472
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,480
Now, moving a little bit more

473
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,400
to the business side of things.

474
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,440
Because that's always something

475
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,320
that I'm very curious about.

476
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,480
How do you get companies

477
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,600
to know who you are

478
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,760
and to understand the value

479
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,480
of Companies for Good?

480
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,000
Because it's not every day

481
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,680
that a company wakes up and says,

482
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,920
"Maybe I should take my team

483
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,360
to a beach cleanup today.

484
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh, and by the way,

485
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,280
there is this Marc

486
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,240
from Companies For Good."

487
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,360
So, how does this whole cycle work?

488
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,680
You know, you would be surprised

489
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,840
that there are many people

490
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,834
that wake up one day and say,

491
00:13:38,835 --> 00:13:39,760
"Oh, I want to do something

492
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,640
with my team."

493
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,600
There are loads of them.

494
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,880
And we're not talking about like the CEO

495
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,560
or the vice president of a company.

496
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,480
We're talking about a team leader.

497
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,560
It could be the head of HR

498
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,080
and you have a team

499
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,200
of seven people under you,

500
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,600
or the head of finance or,

501
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,960
and these people,

502
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,800
it's not their area of expertise, right,

503
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,600
to organize activities.

504
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,960
They have other

505
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,080
kind of day to day jobs to do.

506
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,800
And normally, they want to do something

507
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,440
a bit original.

508
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,040
Something a bit meaningful.

509
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,880
And perhaps they heard

510
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,440
about the escape rooms,

511
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,160
go karting or some similar activities.

512
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,040
They want to do something

513
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,760
like a bit more impactful.

514
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,920
And they don't know,

515
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,280
Right.

516
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,800
They don't know what to do

517
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,880
or what they could do.

518
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,600
And so,

519
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,680
when they found that,

520
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,560
when they find us,

521
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,000
they're really excited.

522
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,480
We had, I think, a very rare position

523
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,640
in the market since the beginning,

524
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,200
which I think we're very blessed about,

525
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,160
which is the clients are happy

526
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,640
when they found us.

527
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,680
We haven't done any

528
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,760
like outreach, any sales.

529
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,920
We've been of course,

530
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,840
we've done like some marketing

531
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,040
and we try to position ourselves

532
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,120
in Google, in the rankings.

533
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,760
It's not that we've been

534
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,480
just sitting and people like, we work.

535
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,360
One of actually interesting things

536
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,440
that you mentioned was that,

537
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,000
you know, this is a pretty niche market.

538
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,120
People don't often search

539
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,520
for beach cleanup

540
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,840
or planting trees on Google.

541
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,200
And that's one of the ways

542
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,920
you've reached to your client base right?

543
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,680
Yes. That's helped us a lot,

544
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,160
that we are in a niche market.

545
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
And so, we've done a little bit

546
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,960
of search engine optimization

547
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,080
on our website

548
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,880
and a little bit of link building

549
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,440
and writing blogs, etc.

550
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,520
So, when people wanted to find us,

551
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,760
it would be easier.

552
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,000
And so in Google,

553
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,520
we rank quite well because of that,

554
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,040
because it's fairly niche

555
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
and we've done an effort.

556
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,640
But also like we were working

557
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,240
with lots of businesses that come to us

558
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,440
because of word of mouth.

559
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,320
So, they ask around, like,

560
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,320
"What can we do to do an activity

561
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,560
that gives back to society

562
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,720
or to that helps the environment?"

563
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,080
And then after having

564
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,000
a couple of conversations,

565
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,720
they're like, "Oh, you know,

566
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,880
you should contact Companies for Good.

567
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,120
They organize these kind of things."

568
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,040
But as I was saying,

569
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,400
like since the beginning,

570
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,200
I was shocked when the phone would ring

571
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,840
and it would be,

572
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,240
I work for DHL.

573
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,200
I work for Killens, I work for HSBC,

574
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,960
I work for Amazon, and I'm like,

575
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,920
"Okay.  And so how can I help you?"

576
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,200
"Oh, we heard you do a tree planting,

577
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,040
or this kind of activity like."

578
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,960
"Yeah, we can help."

579
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,720
"Oh yes please.

580
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,400
That would be amazing.

581
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,000
Because I've been looking for it."

582
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,040
I'm like, "Okay, sure."

583
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,080
"Can we do it next week?"

584
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,920
"Yes, sure."

585
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,480
"This is the price."

586
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,720
"Okay, fine."

587
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,560
So, it's been surprisingly,

588
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,520
I wouldn't say easy because

589
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,040
easy is a undermining word

590
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,160
because we worked hard for it.

591
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,120
But it's been a pleasant journey,

592
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,720
let's put it this way.

593
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,840
That's incredible.

594
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,360
What's next? What's the vision

595
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,640
for Companies for Good?

596
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,760
Well, that's a very good

597
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,720
a very good question.

598
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,760
What we have done a lot

599
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,520
this year is go digital.

600
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:33,800
Yeah.

601
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,680
Like everyone else. Right?

602
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,480
It's no news.

603
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,440
But all our activities

604
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,440
were physical team activities

605
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,200
with teams.

606
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,520
Corona came and we had

607
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,640
to cancel every single activity.

608
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,600
In Feb, we did, I don't know,

609
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,440
about 20 activities.

610
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,600
We had more than 20 booked for March.

611
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,360
It was our best month ever.

612
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,480
We were like growing a lot.

613
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,160
It was amazing.

614
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,840
Everything was like fantastic,

615
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,240
and then boom.

616
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,760
So, from one week to another,

617
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,319
everything got canceled.

618
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,120
And we were like,

619
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,000
okay, is this going to last

620
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,520
like one month or like one year,

621
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,880
ten years, who knows.

622
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,640
But we quickly,

623
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,320
like reinvented ourselves.

624
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,840
And while the situation was,

625
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,600
you know, tough in terms

626
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,120
of physical team activities,

627
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,120
we started to create online things.

628
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,600
And so, now we have a very cool

629
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,080
team building activity called,

630
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,000
the climate change challenge.

631
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,240
And this is like hundreds of people

632
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,160
can play online.

633
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,960
Normally they do it like

634
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,400
in teams of a company.

635
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,880
And it's a group of eco heroes.

636
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,120
They travel around the world

637
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,320
and they go to different continents,

638
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,040
discovering what is

639
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,200
the climate change issue

640
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,200
that is affecting the most in that area.

641
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,120
They need to overcome

642
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,680
different challenges and games

643
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,200
and they keep moving on like

644
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,960
some kind of competing among teams,

645
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,400
but learning at the same time

646
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,880
and having having some fun.

647
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,080
And that's been kind of a positive thing

648
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,080
from these challenging year.

649
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,720
And I think, in terms of the vision

650
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,560
that's where we want to go more,

651
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,120
because physical team activities

652
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,960
are fantastic

653
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,800
and it creates this kind of hype.

654
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,720
But it's a bit more limited in terms of,

655
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,400
where you can do it.

656
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,560
And we also have many businesses

657
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,760
that are international, right.

658
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,240
And so they have an office here,

659
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,680
but they also have an office in Oman,

660
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,840
another one in Saudi

661
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,040
another one in Qatar or elsewhere.

662
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,520
And often, they want to do activities

663
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,240
among their teams

664
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,280
to bring them together

665
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,080
but cross-border.

666
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,040
And how can you do that? Online.

667
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,800
Right.

668
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,280
So, what are some nuggets of advice

669
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,840
you can provide for some

670
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,120
young social entrepreneurs

671
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,560
that are on their journey?

672
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,560
Obviously, it's a very different type

673
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,720
of journey than the average entrepreneur

674
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,000
that is just trying to raise money

675
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,120
for a first startup that is

676
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,360
on the hockey stick trajectory.

677
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,280
What should young entrepreneurs

678
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,760
need to know as they're embarking

679
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,160
on this social adventure?

680
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,400
I think two things

681
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,160
are very, very important.

682
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,440
And one is give,

683
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,800
offer to your customers

684
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,960
what they might want or need.

685
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,000
Not what you like or what you think

686
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,720
they might need like.

687
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,720
I've seen so many

688
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,080
both normal entrepreneurs

689
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,800
or social entrepreneurs,

690
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,040
I don't know why I'm calling them normal,

691
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,760
but whatever,

692
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,600
like non-social entrepreneurs

693
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,440
and social entrepreneurs that

694
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,600
they're so passionate about their idea

695
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,600
and what they want to do

696
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,720
that they have missed

697
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,120
on checking with their customers,

698
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,240
their clients,

699
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,280
if that's what they want

700
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,560
or how they want it.

701
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,840
And they spent a year working

702
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,440
on that product or service,

703
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,920
hidden in a room or something,

704
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,000
investing a lot of money,

705
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,800
even like spending

706
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,720
a lot of time thinking

707
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,800
about the name or the logo.

708
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,440
And then, once they go out there

709
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,040
after a year,

710
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,640
obviously they have no money

711
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,880
and almost no energy

712
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,320
because they are working so hard.

713
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,000
And then often they find

714
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,320
that the customers want something else

715
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,600
or that they want it differently.

716
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,040
And so, it's a very, very

717
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,040
kind of clashing situation.

718
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,640
Whereas, I always tell people, you know,

719
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,400
"Whenever you have a little tiny thing,

720
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,640
go out there. Go out there.

721
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,000
Start operating, start learning."

722
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,040
And that worked for me very well because

723
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,440
when I started Companies for Good,

724
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,040
I went out there

725
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,240
without having a business license,

726
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,320
like the website it was made by me,

727
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,440
and I have no idea

728
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,240
how to make websites.

729
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,520
One of these like premade things.

730
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,680
The logo was made by a friend

731
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,200
and it was a disaster logo.

732
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,680
So, I mean, but so what?

733
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,040
And we started learning.

734
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,520
And we started already engaging

735
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,360
with customers.

736
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,280
Some customers like some of the ideas

737
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,080
and they already started doing activities

738
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,400
which helped us finance

739
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,960
our next steps and so on.

740
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,440
So, it's been,

741
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,840
I think a growth journey

742
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,520
and a smooth journey because of this

743
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,720
kind of action driven attitude

744
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,920
of let's get out there

745
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,840
and let's start working

746
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,000
and then we will be polishing

747
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,720
and improving things as we go.

748
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,160
Wow.

749
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,280
So, that's definitely

750
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,040
one piece of advice.

751
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,280
And the other one is obviously

752
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,640
like believing what you do.

753
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,600
Be passionate about it.

754
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,400
Because there are so many bumps

755
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:06,920
on the journey,

756
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,200
so many difficulties that unless

757
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,640
you like what you're doing

758
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,960
and you believe in it,

759
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,000
you're not going to enjoy it.

760
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,440
And what's the point of setting up

761
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,160
a business if you don't enjoy it?

762
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,560
Right.

763
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,120
100%.

764
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,960
Marc, I want to thank you

765
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,560
for being so gracious with your time.

766
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,320
You know, this is one of few

767
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,040
that we managed to do in person.

768
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,120
And I'm happy that we're able to do this

769
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,520
in a social distancing context

770
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,160
and here in Dubai.

771
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,760
But before we leave,

772
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,720
I have to put you on the spot

773
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,360
for one last question,

774
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,320
which is three words that you would use

775
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,320
to describe yourself

776
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
or your wife would use

777
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,320
to describe you

778
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,400
or any of the companies

779
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,160
that you got to work with.

780
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,160
Wow. Three words.

781
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,000
Maybe I would say action driven person.

782
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,600
Action driven person.

783
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,520
Yeah. I make things happen.

784
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:49,960
I love that.

785
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,520
Marc, thank you very, very much.

786
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,000
Stay safe, stay healthy.

787
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And continue doing good

788
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,480
for the world, literally,

789
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,080
and helping a lot of other companies.

790
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,880
And I'm sure, by the way,

791
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,280
that it's not just limited

792
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,000
to that event

793
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,880
when they come to work with you,

794
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,240
but it's a ripple effect.

795
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,840
They take it then into their home,

796
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,320
to their colleagues,

797
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,200
they tell their families,

798
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,120
and it's creating

799
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,000
a butterfly effect where

800
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,720
it's the network effects is exponential.

801
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,880
And from the team that you work

802
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,720
it just ricochets.

803
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,680
So, thank you very, very much.

804
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,360
Thank you so much.
