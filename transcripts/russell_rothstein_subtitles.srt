1
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,960
Russell Rothstein, thank you so much

2
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,640
for being on my show.

3
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,080
How are you?

4
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,360
Very good, Michael.

5
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,500
Glad to be here.

6
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,280
You're calling all the way

7
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,000
from Modi'in, right?

8
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,120
I am. I am.

9
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,360
So, we're in our Israel office

10
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,920
halfway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.

11
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,280
Why Modi'in?

12
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,000
I know Tel Aviv.

13
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,840
I know Herzliya.

14
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,160
Why Modi'in?

15
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,240
Well, Modi'in is actually one of Israel's

16
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,680
fastest growing metropolitan areas.

17
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,240
It's also, for those of you

18
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,440
who are interested in history,

19
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,280
the place where the Maccabees started

20
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,800
thousands of years ago.

21
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,760
So, it's a great place.

22
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,720
It's very inspiring.

23
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,680
It's a place where

24
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,200
the small group of soldiers

25
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,360
fought against a much larger enemy.

26
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,760
So, it's really well suited

27
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,720
for building a startup.

28
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,960
Of course. Of course.

29
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,320
And actually,

30
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,360
I came to visit you in the offices

31
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,640
about a year and a half ago.

32
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,280
And it's a wonderful, beautiful area.

33
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,200
And definitely a place

34
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,000
that I need to come more often to.

35
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,040
But Russell,

36
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,160
before we talk about IT Central

37
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,440
and talk about covid-19

38
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,920
and what it's like to manage a team

39
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,160
during this crisis,

40
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,080
I want to go back a little bit

41
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,360
about your journey from Harvard,

42
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,640
MIT, MIT Sloan,

43
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,640
talked to me a little bit

44
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,680
about your journey into the business world

45
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,760
and into entrepreneurship.

46
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,560
What was that trigger for you

47
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,840
that got you thinking,

48
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,880
Okay, I want to be part

49
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,680
of this tech ecosystem?

50
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,000
Yeah, sure.

51
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,440
Well, I'd say it even starts

52
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,400
before college.

53
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,960
I'm from the Bronx, born and bred.

54
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,720
And going into college,

55
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,080
I didn't know that I was going to study

56
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,040
computer science.

57
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,320
That's what I did my bachelor's

58
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,080
in computer science.

59
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,280
I didn't know that

60
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,320
at the time going into it.

61
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,840
I really only until sophomore year

62
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,560
did I really hone in on computer science

63
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,560
and found I enjoyed the course in there.

64
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,080
And so, I just followed that

65
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,080
went with that journey.

66
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,280
And then worked in a technical capacity.

67
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,320
I worked at Oracle

68
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,560
as my first job out of college.

69
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,040
Deploying Oracle databases,

70
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,240
and Oracle applications,

71
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,520
do a lot of [--] work.

72
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,400
But at the time,

73
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,680
I really started to think about

74
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,440
what my passion was.

75
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,280
What my strengths were.

76
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,720
I really enjoyed that interaction

77
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,560
of solving problems for customers.

78
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,800
Deploying databases.

79
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,680
Deployment that applications.

80
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,040
That point where I actually,

81
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,120
getting into something

82
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,080
that's valuable to them.

83
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,240
I liked interacting with the customers.

84
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,240
I didn't want to just be sitting

85
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,000
in front of the computer all day.

86
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,680
I really enjoyed talking to the people

87
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,520
and understanding them not just socially,

88
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,040
but also professionally.

89
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,800
What they're doing.

90
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,280
What's this database all about.

91
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,160
What's this application all about.

92
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,440
And then started to think about

93
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,720
from my career.

94
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,400
And it led to me to go to

95
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:21,440
more of a business, less technical route.

96
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,320
I went to MIT.

97
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,080
I started at MIT, or began my MIT journey

98
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,320
in a master's program,

99
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,960
studying technology and policy.

100
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,920
Studying telecommunications policy.

101
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,840
And then, I decided

102
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,200
to take an additional year at MIT.

103
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,280
A third year and got an MBA from Sloan.

104
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,640
So, I did masters and MBA.

105
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,960
And really so, since then,

106
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,600
I moved into the business marketing side

107
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,120
of technology

108
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,400
after I graduated business school.

109
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,440
Very very cool. Okay.

110
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,120
And now, we're talking about IT Central.

111
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,520
So, you're in Modi'in

112
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,280
and  you're running this virtual startup.

113
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,400
Talk to me a little bit about B2B reviews

114
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,760
and understanding software.

115
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,640
What is IT Central?

116
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,960
And what problem are you trying to solve?

117
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,880
Because I think it's a problem

118
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,200
that especially young entrepreneurs,

119
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,280
we don't really get exposed yet

120
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,480
to this area.

121
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,360
We're much more, I think,

122
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,280
we get exposed much more to B2C.

123
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,480
Talk to me a little bit about that.

124
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,640
Exactly.

125
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,200
So, it really began, like you said,

126
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,280
it began with my expertise and knowledge

127
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,080
of the B2B space.

128
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,760
And even within B2B,

129
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,880
the enterprise technology space.

130
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,520
So, I worked in my career

131
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,240
in enterprise technology.

132
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,400
Enterprise software companies.

133
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,960
I mentioned Oracle.

134
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,280
I worked at companies

135
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,120
that developed software

136
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,120
to manage performance of applications,

137
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,120
managed networks.

138
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,720
The kind of software solutions

139
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,960
that larger businesses

140
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,120
would use at banks,

141
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,200
insurance companies, large retailers.

142
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,320
And so, that's the world

143
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:08,000
that I began to really know well.

144
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,600
And so, on one hand,

145
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,160
I was developing this knowledge

146
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,480
and really intellectual curiosity

147
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,840
and love of the enterprise tech space.

148
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,200
But in addition,

149
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,440
I was always really intrigued

150
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,600
by social media.

151
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,000
And a lot of the new trends

152
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,120
going on in B2C.

153
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,240
I was a very early user of Twitter.

154
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,160
Going back a long term history,

155
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,600
I mean, I created my own website

156
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,160
in the late 90s.

157
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,400
Wow.

158
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,640
And so, I've always been interested

159
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,760
in the conversion of the two.

160
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,840
And so, the story

161
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,240
behind IT Central Station

162
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,160
really began in 2011.

163
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,520
And I was having dinner

164
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,840
with a friend of mine, Naftali Marcus,

165
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,320
and he's now the co-founder

166
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,000
of the company.

167
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,720
But at the time

168
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,280
we were just talking about ideas.

169
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,880
Did you know

170
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,320
when you were talking about ideas

171
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,400
so you had an intention

172
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,560
to start a company together?

173
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,920
Or, are rolling off ideas

174
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,720
off of each other?

175
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,200
Or, how did that work?

176
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,800
Yeah. Listen, there's different types

177
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,120
of entrepreneurs out there.

178
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,000
There's entrepreneurs that

179
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,320
every day you talk to them,

180
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,720
you meet with them in like every hour.

181
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,480
They're coming out

182
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,400
with really interesting ideas.

183
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,320
They're always,

184
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,440
they're just overflowing with ideas

185
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,280
for companies or startups.

186
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,040
I'm not that kind of person.

187
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,320
Okay?

188
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,880
My ideas for a startup

189
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,000
come once every 10 years.

190
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,720
Okay. But I have this idea again

191
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,000
back in 2011.

192
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,480
And I invited Naftali

193
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,600
who I had a lot of respect for.

194
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,760
I have a lot of respect for.

195
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:13,040
I had some ideas to get him involved.

196
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,560
And so, really I explained to him that.

197
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,200
So, we're having dinner.

198
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,640
It was in Manhattan.

199
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,280
We're having some hummus and kebabs.

200
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,240
Of course.

201
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,880
Of course.

202
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,680
Exactly.

203
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,000
And again,

204
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,400
this was a time where there weren't

205
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,480
such things as B2B review sites.

206
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,800
So again, before we go

207
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,720
into intellectual problem,

208
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,920
what is the problem space

209
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,040
that you're trying to solve?

210
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,440
So, there aren't B2B review sites.

211
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,640
What does that even mean?

212
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,960
As a young consumer,

213
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,680
I don't even know

214
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,600
why we need a B2B review sites.

215
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,160
Exactly.

216
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,120
And that's what I explained

217
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,640
to Naftali over this dinner.

218
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,080
I said, here I was,

219
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,880
and I just traveled to New York,

220
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,320
I stayed at a hotel,

221
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,520
and I used reviews from TripAdvisor

222
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,400
to help me make a decision

223
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,000
about which hotel I will stay at.

224
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,920
It's really important.

225
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,320
I mean, I think it's obvious that

226
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,240
before you make

227
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,640
any important purchase today,

228
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,640
you want to go online

229
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,360
and read reviews.

230
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,680
Whether those are Amazon reviews,

231
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,960
Yelp reviews, what have you.

232
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,120
But am I in the business world

233
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,520
where I was working with

234
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,640
enterprise technology professionals.

235
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,920
So, these people,

236
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,480
these IT manager, CIOs,

237
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,960
enterprise technology folks,

238
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,040
their responsibility

239
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,440
was to choose software

240
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,480
or choose technology for their business.

241
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,200
A new cybersecurity solution

242
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,440
to help their business stay more secure.

243
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,840
Some type of new software

244
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,680
to help them build applications

245
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,120
better, faster.

246
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,400
A new type of application

247
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,760
to manage their business.

248
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:00,160
And they did not have access to reviews.

249
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,320
They did not have access to easy way

250
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,840
to tap into the knowledge of other people

251
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,840
who had already checked the market,

252
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,760
who already researched solutions,

253
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,200
really use some of those solutions.

254
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,000
But Russell, what my intuition

255
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,520
is guiding me is saying,

256
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,520
when I look in to buy headphones,

257
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,000
there may be 500 different types

258
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,560
of headphones

259
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,480
and all sorts of price variations.

260
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,960
And it's a really congested market.

261
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,000
When I think of a cyber security solution

262
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,400
for my company, maybe there is like

263
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,400
three or four good solutions, not 500.

264
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,000
Maybe I'm wrong.

265
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,560
But my intuition just says that maybe

266
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,880
because there's less reviews,

267
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,960
it's a little easier.

268
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,840
Or less product, it's a little easier.

269
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,520
But maybe I'm wrong.

270
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,880
Well, it depends.

271
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,400
Enterprise tech is a huge market.

272
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,720
It's three trillion dollars.

273
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,640
Three trillion dollars is spent every year

274
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,640
on enterprise technology solutions.

275
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,880
So, there are some markets

276
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,000
where there are,

277
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,080
take IT service management

278
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,160
and many cybersecurity.

279
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,440
There are dozens of solutions out there.

280
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,520
It's very confusing.

281
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,840
And different than headphones.

282
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,040
Very different than headphones.

283
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,960
Because headphones,

284
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,120
you have same use case, right?

285
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,840
You're using it to listen to your music.

286
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,320
And maybe they've got

287
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,560
some different features.

288
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,920
These different types

289
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,400
of enterprise technology solutions

290
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,800
are more complex.

291
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,200
And so, it's oftentimes

292
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
it's comparing apples with oranges.

293
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,280
Or one type of apple

294
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,160
with a different type of apple.

295
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,000
And so, its very complex.

296
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,760
So, even if there are just a handful

297
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,080
and oftentimes there are dozens,

298
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,280
but even they are just a handful,

299
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,480
it can be a very

300
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,640
complicated buying process.

301
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,800
And, so it's really helpful

302
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,640
to talk to people

303
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,440
already gone through that

304
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,080
and then gone to the market.

305
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,120
So again, going back to that dinner,

306
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,760
I said,

307
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,640
"How could it be

308
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,760
that I had all access to all these reviews

309
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,200
when I was just choosing a hotel?"

310
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,320
which not the most crucial decision

311
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,240
in the world for me.

312
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,560
but business people or technology people

313
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,000
are basically betting their career

314
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,440
on this technology solution.

315
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,440
Because if it works well,

316
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,480
they're the hero.

317
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,720
If it doesn't work well,

318
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,000
it can be damaging to their career.

319
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,520
And obviously, you can save the company

320
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,720
millions of dollars

321
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,000
to make the right technology purchase.

322
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,840
Where you obviously,

323
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,120
you can lose lots of money

324
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,000
if it's the wrong purchase.

325
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,720
It's still important strategic.

326
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,320
And so, that's how we got

327
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,800
to starting IT Central Station.

328
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
It's the leading review site,

329
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,760
real authentic reviews written by

330
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,760
enterprise technology professionals.

331
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,000
So, it's not B2C.

332
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,200
And even within B2B, it's not targeted

333
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,040
for the small medium business market.

334
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,120
It's targeted to

335
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,920
enterprise technology buyers

336
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,200
with their unique needs.

337
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,200
How do you get people

338
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,000
to write the reviews?

339
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So, how do you get this,

340
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,880
the CIO or the VP R&D to come in

341
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,560
and then say,

342
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,120
Yes, I purchased this

343
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,680
cyber security software.

344
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,360
We've been using it for three months

345
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,640
and we're happy or unhappy and here's why.

346
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,000
Yeah. Yeah.

347
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,880
So, it's really important

348
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,720
because it's not a question of just,

349
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,160
you don't want just to have

350
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,640
a really short review, right?

351
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,120
I mean, that could be helpful.

352
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,920
That might be good for me

353
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,520
when I'm choosing a hotel.

354
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,880
I just want to know,

355
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,840
a lot of people say that,

356
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,440
So, you want to know

357
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,640
how many stars out of five.

358
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,040
You don't necessarily care about

359
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,840
the little details.

360
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,160
Exactly. Exactly.

361
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,680
So, for but for enterprise

362
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,520
technology buyers,

363
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,680
it's much more important

364
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,160
to have that in-depth content

365
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,560
because someone evaluating technology,

366
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,040
enterprise technology for their business,

367
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,480
they have a whole lot of questions

368
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,320
that they want to ask.

369
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,120
They want to know.

370
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,600
Again, what is the use case

371
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,440
that they're using it for.

372
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,040
How is the implementation.

373
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,400
What's the business case.

374
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,720
What's the return on investment.

375
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,920
Where is the room for improvement.

376
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,400
What other pieces of advice.

377
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,560
What's the best licensing strategy

378
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,160
to work with this vendor

379
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,800
Right.

380
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,400
There's a lot of information there.

381
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,760
So, our strategy is not only

382
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,040
to get reviews,

383
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,560
but focus on the quality of the reviews.

384
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,260
So, it's not a numbers game.

385
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,080
It's not getting millions and millions

386
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,520
of reviews.

387
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,680
It's getting that reviews

388
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,520
that are generally valuable

389
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,720
to help people make buying decisions

390
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,440
in their enterprise technology purpose.

391
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,960
And so, the kind of incentive

392
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,840
that we put in place is very different

393
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,000
than the kind of incentives

394
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,160
that you might see in B2C review site.

395
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:43,520
So B2C review sites,

396
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,440
first of all, there's sometimes issues

397
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,040
with fake reviews.

398
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,680
People giving out gift cards.

399
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,760
And  all those things

400
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,440
to incentivize people.

401
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,480
And it sometimes creates bad actors.

402
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,520
We've decided to do

403
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,480
zero financial incentives.

404
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,080
We don't pay people to write reviews.

405
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,320
And that's really important.

406
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,960
Really,really important not to pay people

407
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,480
to provide reviews.

408
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,760
And really it's observing,

409
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,800
If you're familiar

410
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,000
with the Maslow hierarchy.

411
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,920
Of course.

412
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,440
Right. So, of needs.

413
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,600
So, the bottom are the more

414
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,000
those of physical needs.

415
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,520
And so, to motivate people by giving them

416
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,400
either financial incentives.

417
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,520
Write a review we'll give you

418
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,280
a $10 gift card

419
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,480
or a five dollar Starbucks card.

420
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,440
That's of the low part

421
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,160
of the Maslow hierarchy.

422
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,520
Right.

423
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,800
The upper part of the Maslow hierarchy

424
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,720
is self actualization.

425
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,360
That's the top of the Maslow hierarchy.

426
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,040
So those are the levers that we pull.

427
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,480
So, we provide ways

428
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,120
for our viewers to see

429
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,400
how providing review helps the community.

430
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,440
The altruism is a very strong force

431
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,200
for many people.

432
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,680
Two is, it's a way for you to be seen

433
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,520
as a thought leader.

434
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,080
Especially in today's market.

435
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,320
Especially in today's market.

436
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,200
If you're a technology person,

437
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,680
how do you promote yourself.

438
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,360
How do you get your promotion.

439
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,520
How do you get your next job.

440
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,880
It's by showing that you're knowledgeable

441
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,800
about a particular solution.

442
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,840
If you're really an expert at this

443
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,720
salesforce implementation

444
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,720
at the cybersecurity deployment,

445
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,600
whatever it is, then you're going to be

446
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,320
more valuable out there in the market.

447
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:32,120
And so, we're able to use these levers

448
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,560
to get people to provide

449
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,120
more in-depth reviews.

450
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,520
How we find these people?

451
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,480
So, there's really two ways

452
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,480
that we find people

453
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,800
who are providing reviews.

454
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,680
One is members of our community.

455
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,680
We have 400,000 registered members

456
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,640
in IT Central Station.

457
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,760
And so, they're actively

458
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,880
providing reviews.

459
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,400
We do solicit reviews from them.

460
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,480
They're answering questions.

461
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,000
Because we've focused on that

462
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,800
community aspect of it,

463
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,200
they stay engaged with the platform.

464
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,000
Wow.

465
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,080
One is our process

466
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,680
to continue and solicit reviews

467
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,040
from our community.

468
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,120
And the second aspect is

469
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,720
there are lots of technology companies

470
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,200
that simply want more reviews

471
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,840
of their products.

472
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,320
And that's part of our business model.

473
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,280
We're fully transparent about it.

474
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,120
It's called reviews.

475
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,800
It's a service.

476
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,960
And so, the way that will work is that

477
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,080
if a company wants more reviews

478
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,680
of its products,

479
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:30,640
it will use a service subscription program

480
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,960
with IT Central Station.

481
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,040
They will provide us

482
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,280
with lists of their customers.

483
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,120
And then we,

484
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,240
as an independent third party,

485
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,760
completely neutral,

486
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,280
collect those reviews from them.

487
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,120
And it's a win-win

488
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,760
because you both get the reviews

489
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,160
and you get,

490
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,080
Exactly. Exactly.

491
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,520
The technology vendor

492
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,080
does not have any veto rights.

493
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,880
They don't get to edit the review.

494
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,240
So, it's very possible.

495
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:54,960
And it happens.

496
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,840
It happens sometimes.

497
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,600
Those reviewers are actually critical

498
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,880
of the product's that they use.

499
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,080
But that's part of the game.

500
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,920
Because if they're all five star reviews,

501
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,440
it's not credible at all.

502
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,320
You all know that, right?

503
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,400
You've go to a page on Amazon.

504
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,480
It happens all the time.

505
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,760
And I see all these reviews

506
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,520
and they're all positive.

507
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:10,960
And it's like,

508
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,640
Okay. Something's going on here.

509
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,120
And then you see a couple

510
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,080
of the one stars

511
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,720
and they're there in length,

512
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,920
and then you feel something is fishy.

513
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,800
Yeah, exactly.

514
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,320
But if I see a lot of like

515
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,880
four star reviews,

516
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,120
this was really good,

517
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,120
but it didn't work for me in that.

518
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,720
But that's the most credible review.

519
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,000
And that's where we aim for

520
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,200
is to get those credible reviews

521
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,400
that provide both,

522
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,920
this is what's great about it,

523
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,240
but also there's the room for improvement.

524
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,720
I love it.

525
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,280
I remember somebody

526
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,600
back in the in middle school

527
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,240
or high school.

528
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,320
They told me that it's always much better

529
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,680
to get a 97 on a test than 100.

530
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,080
Because 100 means that the test was easy.

531
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,640
You just ace it.

532
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,720
If it's a 97, it means

533
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,080
you worked really really hard

534
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,760
and it was a really hard test

535
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,520
and you still got a good score.

536
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,160
So, I think it's exactly the same thing.

537
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,120
You want to get those scores

538
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,600
and those five.

539
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,720
You don't want to just get all five

540
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,200
because that diminishes the value

541
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:08,920
of those reviews.

542
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,360
Russell, what I want to transition also

543
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,760
to a little bit about work from home.

544
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,720
Because we're almost out of time.

545
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,640
But I want to hear a little bit

546
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,320
about your leadership style.

547
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,520
And covid is unfolding.

548
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,160
You're still running the team.

549
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,880
What do you do?

550
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,080
How do you as a leader

551
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,280
come and approach this crisis?

552
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,560
Yeah. So, there have been

553
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,880
a few guiding principles.

554
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,680
I think the first is compassion.

555
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,800
Covid has affect

556
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,400
many people in the world

557
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,840
from a health perspective,

558
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,040
from an employment perspective.

559
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,400
And we're fortunate

560
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,120
here in the company

561
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,640
we've grown since covid.

562
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,160
We did not have any layoffs.

563
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,720
We do not have any pay cuts.

564
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,160
We've grown, we're hiring.

565
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,880
We're continuing to hire.

566
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,120
But still, it starts with compassion.

567
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,360
Again, we're fortunate

568
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,200
none of our employees

569
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,640
have had any serious, to my knowledge,

570
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,840
health issues as a result.

571
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,560
But it's always knowing that whether

572
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,720
people might have a family member,

573
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,320
a friend, what have you,

574
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,440
who's affected by it.

575
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,400
And so, it all starts with compassion.

576
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,080
And to articulate that.

577
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,320
So, that's number one.

578
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,560
Number two, is communication.

579
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,280
So, I really had to ramp up

580
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,960
my communication with the team.

581
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,160
Because we shifted

582
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,080
from being in the office

583
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,960
to working from home.

584
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,720
We're now back in the office.

585
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,960
Many of us.

586
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,040
But for a period of time, obviously,

587
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,280
we were all working remotely from home.

588
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,840
And so, it's really about

589
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,080
overcommunicating.

590
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,840
So, I would do some things

591
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,280
that I hadn't done previously.

592
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,880
I was sending WhatsApp messages

593
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,760
to the entire team.

594
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,400
We were doing

595
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,240
some special types of videos

596
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,000
to keep the team entertained.

597
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,720
And obviously I would have more

598
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,880
frequent meetings with my cabinet,

599
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,800
my management team, with the entire team.

600
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,360
So, we just increased communication flow.

601
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,000
That was also really important.

602
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,560
Not to underestimate the challenges

603
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,080
of working from home, right?

604
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,560
On one hand, for some people,

605
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,600
some people really like it,

606
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,520
but it can be very tiring.

607
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,320
It can be very tiring to work from home.

608
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,400
And really just want to be there

609
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,800
and support the staff,

610
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,320
support the employees.

611
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,120
So, those are the things that we did.

612
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,800
We did some fun things,

613
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,200
had some fun along the way as well.

614
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,600
A couple of staff

615
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,640
had to go into quarantine.

616
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,720
So, we had a rule that

617
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,560
anyone goes into quarantine,

618
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,560
gets a pizza sent to their home

619
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,720
to feed their family for the night.

620
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,200
So, we sent out a bunch pizzas

621
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,440
and then people would then

622
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,840
take pictures of the pizzas

623
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,760
and share it with their team.

624
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,640
So, it became this fun company activity.

625
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,520
So, to come up with those

626
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,440
kind of creative things that we did.

627
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,120
Russell, that is so so cool.

628
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,920
Thank you again for being

629
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,840
so generous with your time.

630
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,320
This is so interesting.

631
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,200
And I learned a lot

632
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,600
over these past 20 minutes.

633
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,320
Before we leave,

634
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,960
I'd love to ask you for three words

635
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,160
that you would use to describe yourself.

636
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,080
Yeah. I'd say,

637
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,960
always be learning.

638
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,960
That is something that

639
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,360
I've always had a thirst for learning.

640
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,000
It's one of the values

641
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,960
of our culture credo

642
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,800
here in the company.

643
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,560
Always be learning.

644
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,000
We're all here in the company

645
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,440
it's a mandate to always be learning.

646
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,240
The funny thing is

647
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,520
when you get to be my age,

648
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,240
what you do is you learn

649
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,560
that the more you learn,

650
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,120
the more you don't know.

651
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,880
So, I'm in this now cycle

652
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,120
where the more I keep learning,

653
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:40,960
the more I realize

654
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,640
I don't know so much

655
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,160
and there's so much to learn.

656
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,520
So, it can be sometimes

657
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,320
quite a challenge.

658
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,960
But that's something that I think

659
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,560
is really a driver for who I am.

660
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,400
Very very cool.

661
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,580
Russell, toda raba.

662
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,720
Thank you very very much.

663
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,000
Best of luck with both about the covid,

664
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,160
but also with IT Central Station.

665
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,600
It sounds really incredible

666
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,280
what you guys are doing.

667
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,920
And I love the different

668
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,320
intrinsic motivations

669
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,720
and the thought processes

670
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,840
behind how to get this to be,

671
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,280
to create actual value

672
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,720
and not just artificial value

673
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,640
on the surface of it.

674
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,680
And it sounds like this idea

675
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,960
behind growing a community

676
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,280
that actually cares

677
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,640
and actually wants to help

678
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,960
and wants to be shown and seen

679
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,520
while creating value for them too

680
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,520
is an incredible accomplishment.

681
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,240
So, Russell, thank you very much.

682
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,000
Thank you, Michael.

683
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,600
It was fun.
