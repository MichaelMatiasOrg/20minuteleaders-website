1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,960
You should always have a goal.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,920
It's okay if you change that goal

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,680
at an every given time.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,520
But you always need to ask yourself,

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,300
why do you do what you do.

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,378
Tomer Cohen,

7
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:37,496
thank you for joining me

8
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:38,520
on 20 Minute Leaders.

9
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:38,960
Good morning.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,600
Thank you for having me, Michael.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,320
It's great being here.

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,360
It is an honor and a pleasure

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:44,880
to have you.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,320
All the way from the soccer field

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,880
from a year or two ago.

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,000
All the way now.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,880
Look how far we've come, you see.

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,923
It's really really a pleasure

19
00:00:53,924 --> 00:00:56,080
to have you here because you have

20
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,840
one of those unique journeys

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,840
that I can't wait to hear

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,720
your perspective on.

23
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,080
Going from the political scene,

24
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,280
from the spokesperson scene.

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,720
You are very very active

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,080
with various political campaigns

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,520
like Yesh Atid in Israel.

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,320
Or being the spokesperson of various

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,120
and really important figures.

30
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,080
Going to New York

31
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,040
and being the chief of staff

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,040
of the delegation to the UN.

33
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,280
And then, transitioning into

34
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,440
the business sector and running Jobit,

35
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,000
helping people find jobs across Israel.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,920
And most recently, being the CEO

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,880
of the amazing company BUYME.

38
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,400
Tomer, give me a little bit of rundown

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,080
of that transition.

40
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,120
Why go into politics in the first place?

41
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,280
And what is the trigger

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,520
that pushes you more towards business?

43
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,760
Well, I actually I always knew

44
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,760
that I wanted to take part in business.

45
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,240
But right after the Army,

46
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,480
I did five years of military service.

47
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,480
Four of which in the paratroopers

48
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,520
and then one year

49
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,200
in the IDF spokesperson unit.

50
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,760
And then, when I was done with that

51
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,720
I had the dilemma of whether or not

52
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,680
I should go to study full time

53
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,480
or work full time.

54
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,960
And I felt like doing, you know,

55
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,880
such an amazing things in the Army,

56
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,206
I felt that I want to be part

57
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:05,800
of the action

58
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,880
and not only go to school and learn.

59
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,880
And when I, you know,

60
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,240
I took a look at my sets of skills

61
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,160
and sportsmanship was one of them.

62
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,840
I did not know anything

63
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,440
about business, entrepreneurship,

64
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,160
being a manager, nothing.

65
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,120
And when I look around

66
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,960
in the Israeli market,

67
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,080
I saw that there is an opening

68
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,360
in the Israeli Knesset,

69
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,920
in the Israeli parliament.

70
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,280
And so, I started my career there

71
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,560
knowing that eventually

72
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,320
I want to move into business.

73
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,440
But during that time, I studied my LL.B.

74
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,360
And I work fortunately

75
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,520
in the Israeli parliament.

76
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,840
So, again, I knew that

77
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,640
that would be the case in the end.

78
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,680
I actually, five years

79
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,080
after I started politics,

80
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,800
I wanted to do the transition.

81
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,680
And then I got the offer

82
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,640
to move to New York

83
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,720
and be, as you said,

84
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,160
chief of staff to the Israeli mission

85
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,840
to the United Nations.

86
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,400
And when that was done

87
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,760
and I came back to Israel,

88
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,320
that was like

89
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,520
a very natural choice for me.

90
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,200
Right.

91
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,400
So, tell me a little bit about

92
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,080
this spokesperson role.

93
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,760
Because it's a very unique role

94
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,400
that very few people hold, right?

95
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,680
I'm guessing there is not

96
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,040
too many spokespeople

97
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,120
for the different groups.

98
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,640
You've gotten to be spokesperson

99
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,000
both for individuals,

100
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,560
but you've also got to be a spokesperson

101
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,320
for a whole new political campaign,

102
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:21,920
Yesh Atid.

103
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,960
So, what is that role

104
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,160
and what are some of the responsibilities

105
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,720
that come with it?

106
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,200
Actually, the spokesperson part

107
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,120
was like, I think 18 months

108
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,280
of my seven years career

109
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,520
in the political and diplomatic sector.

110
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,520
So, during those 18 months, as you said,

111
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,280
I was a spokesman

112
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,720
for an Israeli parliament member.

113
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,840
And then a spokesman for,

114
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,445
you can say,

115
00:03:43,446 --> 00:03:45,320
an Israeli political startup,

116
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,950
which was Yesh Atid back in the day.

117
00:03:46,951 --> 00:03:49,520
Right. I love that term, yeah.

118
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,800
It was a startup

119
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,360
and it felt that way, you know.

120
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
A group of young people

121
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,040
trying to change the world.

122
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:59,120
And being a spokesperson

123
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,560
is pretty much knowing

124
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,200
what is the biggest advantage

125
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,320
of the person or the entity

126
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,960
you are trying to convey their message

127
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,000
into the public and making sure

128
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,400
that the public will know the good stuff,

129
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,640
the strengths, and make sure

130
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,000
that the weaknesses will be left behind.

131
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,360
And if, for some reason,

132
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,440
the media try to tackle them,

133
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,160
you provide the right answer.

134
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,240
So, it's basically conveying a message.

135
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,760
Very similar to marketing in a sense.

136
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,680
So, I did that for 18 months, as I said.

137
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,960
And then I moved into,

138
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,520
I will say, being a manager,

139
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,000
being someone who get things done

140
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,880
in the political and diplomatic sector.

141
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,440
So, I was the chief of staff

142
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,960
to the Israeli minister

143
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,080
of science and technology.

144
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,560
Former head of Shin Bet,

145
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,360
which is the Israel, you can say FBI.

146
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,880
And I learned a lot from him

147
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,840
for like almost two years.

148
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,680
And that prepared me for my,

149
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,840
I will say my biggest role at the UN,

150
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,040
which is basically

151
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,000
you know, it's representing our country

152
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,080
in the most hostile environment

153
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,680
diplomatic wise.

154
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,160
That is incredible.

155
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,800
Yeah.

156
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,600
So, you find yourself in New York

157
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,640
the Israeli mission

158
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,160
to the United Nations.

159
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,560
Give me the biggest challenge

160
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:19,960
that you had.

161
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,120
What was the most difficult thing

162
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,400
that you encountered?

163
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,000
Because, you know,

164
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,560
from our industry now,

165
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,480
very, very few people

166
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,280
are going to have a chance

167
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,120
to experience being in such

168
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,120
a difficult diplomatic scene.

169
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,600
So, paint me a little bit of a picture

170
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,560
of what was the most perhaps challenging

171
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,040
and also exhilarating part

172
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,720
of that whole journey.

173
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,120
So, I will try to use an analogy.

174
00:05:42,121 --> 00:05:44,880
So, imagine you have a startup.

175
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,760
And you know your product is good.

176
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,320
It's amazing.

177
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,960
And you need to sell that product

178
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,800
to a specific market.

179
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,240
And no one in that market

180
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,160
is even willing to sit down

181
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,360
and have a conversation with you.

182
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,440
No one.

183
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,104
You find like two or three

184
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:03,320
good major clients

185
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,840
and you sell them your product

186
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,440
and they feel very confident about it

187
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,280
and they use it

188
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,760
and they are happy with it.

189
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,640
But then, when you try and take that

190
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,320
and broaden it

191
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,640
and move into the scale mode,

192
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,720
you just cannot because no one

193
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,160
is even taking the meeting.

194
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,520
And in that very strange,

195
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,240
weird situation,

196
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,840
you need to find a way

197
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,280
to get people to listen.

198
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,200
And that was, I think,

199
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,160
the main challenge.

200
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,080
To get people to listen to you

201
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,800
and be willing to learn

202
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,560
from what you have to say.

203
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,680
That's incredible.

204
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,240
I love that analogy.

205
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,160
Having a product, knowing that it's good,

206
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,040
having some major clients,

207
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,160
but the market is not willing

208
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,920
to even sit down and listen to you.

209
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,240
I could not have said better.

210
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,840
Tomer, that transition, Jobits.

211
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,000
You have done a few organizations,

212
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,600
now you are running BUYME.

213
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,520
If I look at both Jobit and BUYME,

214
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,240
they're very similar in the sense of

215
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,600
you're making people happy.

216
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,560
And it's not in the traditional way

217
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,160
of just sending them money

218
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,480
or sending them a gift basket.

219
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,320
But you're creating opportunities

220
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,280
for people, on one hand

221
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,920
you're creating job opportunities.

222
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,440
On the other hand,

223
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,040
you're creating opportunities for unity,

224
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,120
for a company-wide partnership.

225
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,040
And for people within the company

226
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,000
to gift others.

227
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,480
So, tell me a little bit about why Jobit

228
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,480
and then we'll move on to BUYME.

229
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:22,056
Sure thing.

230
00:07:22,057 --> 00:07:25,400
So, when I came back to Israel,

231
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,760
I was debating whether or not

232
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,560
I should go into a big corporate.

233
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,480
I had a few offers

234
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,880
from big tech companies in Israel,

235
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,320
or should I start something by myself.

236
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,680
And I eventually decided

237
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,320
to become an entrepreneur

238
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,280
and actually found the company.

239
00:07:41,281 --> 00:07:44,960
And my main issue was back then

240
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,440
that I wanted to make sure

241
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,120
that I as you said, I do good,

242
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,520
I want to make sure that the things I do

243
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,080
and the time I spend

244
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,000
will have some sort of

245
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,440
a good impact on people

246
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,480
and hopefully on society as well.

247
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,960
So, that's when I started Jobit.

248
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,080
Jobit is an innovative placement company

249
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,720
who puts their effort

250
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,960
on helping people grow

251
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,080
and manage their career.

252
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,360
We were focusing

253
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,440
on Gen-Y and Gen-Zed.

254
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,440
I'm part of that generation

255
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,800
so I can help.

256
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,560
I know exactly what they need

257
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,240
as far as career management is concern.

258
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,480
You know, we love to move around

259
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,280
from position to position,

260
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,760
from job to job.

261
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,200
A live [--] example.

262
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,320
Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

263
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,480
And I'm doing that for two years,

264
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,080
you know, building the company,

265
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,040
building the product, the brand,

266
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,200
bringing in the team

267
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,120
and building something that is unique

268
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,880
in the Israeli ecosystem

269
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,040
was an amazing experience.

270
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,560
And I felt like I was doing good,

271
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,960
and I learn a lot from the process.

272
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,800
And Jobit is still up and running.

273
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,760
It has a much better CEO

274
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,360
than myself right now running it.

275
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,640
And they're doing a very good job.

276
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,080
I love that.

277
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,160
You know, one of the things that I love

278
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,960
about this show is that

279
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,160
I get to take people like you

280
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,400
that have spent now

281
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,120
almost three years really

282
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,280
becoming an expert

283
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,720
on the Gen-Y, Gen-Zed market

284
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,160
of job seekers and career seekers.

285
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,760
And you get to now teach me

286
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,680
in a few minutes

287
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,600
everything that you've learned

288
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,160
or some things that you've learned

289
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,240
over those three years.

290
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,840
So Tomer, just hit me.

291
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,800
What are some insights

292
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,000
of Gen-Y and Gen-Zed job seekers

293
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,520
in the market?

294
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,760
Well, the way I look at it

295
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,280
and a lot of very smart people

296
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,120
did a lot of research

297
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,080
is that I had the chance of reading

298
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,840
in the States, in Israel.

299
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,800
And the main thing I learned is that,

300
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,720
you know in the past

301
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,520
when you started a job,

302
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,640
that job usually was,

303
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,400
again, I love analogies,

304
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,720
that job was the book

305
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,880
of your professional life.

306
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,520
So, you started in chapter one

307
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,560
and you move from chapter to chapter.

308
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,600
And at the end,

309
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,680
you can pretty much imagine what will be

310
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,200
the minute you start that job,

311
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,280
you can pretty much imagine

312
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,640
what's it going to look like in the end.

313
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,480
But our generation is different.

314
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,400
The way we act

315
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,840
is we act more in a chapter mode.

316
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,400
So, each time you decide

317
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,120
on a certain way

318
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,160
you want to tackle your career

319
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,360
and you spend a chapter there

320
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,000
if you're doing a good job.

321
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,280
So, it's like two years at a time.

322
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,240
And the hard part

323
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,280
is finding the connections

324
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,640
between the two chapters

325
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,233
to make sure

326
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:29,280
that you are always moving forward

327
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,080
and not moving to the side.

328
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,720
And that is why I started Jobit.

329
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,320
I wanted to help people

330
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,400
manage their career.

331
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,280
Create a career path

332
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,960
that will help them reach their goal.

333
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,960
And in most cases at the beginning,

334
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,960
they don't even know what their goal is.

335
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,840
The question is,

336
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,040
what do you want to do

337
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,840
when you grow up

338
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,760
and where do you see yourself

339
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,520
in five or 10 years time?

340
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,560
It's not part of the conversation.

341
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,320
No one ever thought

342
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,200
that this is something

343
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,680
we need to plan for.

344
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,920
Now, always when I said that,

345
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,520
your follow up question should be,

346
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,440
"Yeah, but how do you know

347
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
what you want to do

348
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
when you grow up?"

349
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:05,120
The world is full

350
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,840
of different possibilities.

351
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,200
And my take on that

352
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,680
is that you should always have a goal.

353
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,600
It's okay if you change that goal

354
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,400
at an every given time.

355
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,240
But you always need to ask yourself,

356
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,720
why do you do what you do.

357
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,600
Why do you spend your most

358
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,920
valuable asset, which is your time,

359
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,600
in that particular place

360
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,520
doing that particular thing.

361
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,240
And that is that is my main take

362
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,280
on our generation.

363
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,240
We need to plan ahead

364
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,280
and make sure we do

365
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,600
what needs to be done

366
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,600
in order to achieve our goals.

367
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,720
I couldn't agree more

368
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,640
and I have to follow through with it

369
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,680
with an analogy of my own.

370
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,280
I remember about four years ago

371
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,640
when I was attempting

372
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,800
to run a marathon

373
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,800
in Eilat and I remember

374
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,920
that my coach told me something

375
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,400
that really helped me

376
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,120
at the end finish it

377
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,960
was it doesn't really matter

378
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,400
what happens in these four hours.

379
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,520
You can't plan ahead and say,

380
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,480
my goal is to finish the marathon

381
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
in four hours.

382
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,440
Look at that tree

383
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,840
and run those 50 meters.

384
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,760
When you get to that tree, re-evaluate.

385
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,880
Do you want to make another goal

386
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,760
for another 50 meters?

387
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,480
You probably will

388
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,600
and then you'll make it.

389
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,840
If you plan too far

390
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,000
and you get stumbled along the way,

391
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,280
you lose sight of the bigger picture

392
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,560
and how those small steps

393
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,360
can be meaningful.

394
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,680
And I think that you know,

395
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,120
what you've done with the Jobit

396
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,400
is so inspiring.

397
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,640
And it's helped so many people.

398
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,960
That's a true positive impact.

399
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,000
Because I think that

400
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,240
I can speak freely for our generation.

401
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,880
And I'm a little bit younger than you

402
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,760
so, I think that I even feel more.

403
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,200
You know, we have no idea

404
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,800
where the world is going to end up

405
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,560
in 10, 15 years.

406
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,800
You know, we've accelerated in 2020

407
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,720
about 10, 15 years in the future already

408
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,560
in terms of digitalization.

409
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,240
You know, we're going to,

410
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,840
and I think McKinsey estimates

411
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,440
that we're going to be

412
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,400
changing our careers, our core career,

413
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,760
about three or four times

414
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,800
along our lifetime,

415
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,160
which is insane.

416
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,720
And so, having a place like Jobit

417
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,960
which can help you consolidate

418
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,880
your thoughts, set those milestones

419
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,520
and think more critically about

420
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,840
what type of person you want to be.

421
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,440
I love it.

422
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,040
Tomer, BUYME.

423
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,200
You transitioned from Jobit to BUYME.

424
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,440
You're going into an existing company.

425
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,200
Tell me why and what is BUYME?

426
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,480
Well, I think the main reason,

427
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,000
I'll take it in a different way.

428
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,920
First of all, BUYME

429
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,440
is an amazing company.

430
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,200
It has an amazing technological product

431
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,240
enables people and companies,

432
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,680
give gifts to the people they care about.

433
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,360
And just being part

434
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,960
of that kind of an environment

435
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,200
is addicting, really.

436
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,440
Because as I said at the beginning,

437
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,280
we do a lot of good.

438
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,040
In BUYME in our platform

439
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,320
in every less than a minute,

440
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,440
a gift is being send to someone.

441
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,000
And that's amazing.

442
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,760
The reason I did the transitioning

443
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,480
beside the opportunity to emerge

444
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,800
and I was approached

445
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,360
to take part in this company

446
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,000
is basically, I think the scale.

447
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,800
So, Jobit is an amazing company

448
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,800
with an amazing cause.

449
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,120
But it was relatively

450
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,280
small scale back then.

451
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,840
And today BUYME is like, I think

452
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,480
I don't know, 10 or 15 or 20 times bigger

453
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,120
in employees, impact, P&L,

454
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,320
everything that is in the zone of

455
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,720
managing the company.

456
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,200
And I love mechanisms.

457
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,120
I'm a manager

458
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,720
and I love setting up mechanism

459
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,520
who can create an impact on people,

460
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,840
on the people I manage,

461
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,560
my employees, my team.

462
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,280
And that opportunity when it emerged,

463
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,400
I had no doubt that this is,

464
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,200
this should be my next chapter.

465
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,689
[--]

466
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:30,520
I love it.

467
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,920
So, you mentioned that

468
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,040
BUYME is about gifting.

469
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,400
In every minute somebody gets a gift,

470
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,880
which is, by the way, incredible.

471
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,840
And I can, you know, at the end,

472
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,040
when we talk about entrepreneurship,

473
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,640
I think that at the end

474
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,680
it comes down to

475
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,480
what can make you feel fulfilled

476
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,648
to sleep at night well.

477
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,680
And I would love going to sleep knowing

478
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,080
that I'm running a company

479
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,080
whose product is that

480
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,120
every single minute

481
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,040
somebody is getting a happy gift

482
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,920
and is putting a smile on their face.

483
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,440
What is this gifting process?

484
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,880
And why is it different or innovative

485
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,120
from the traditional gifting

486
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,880
where I can call ZER4U

487
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,680
or a flower shop

488
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,240
and just send a gift basket

489
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,320
to my employees?

490
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,040
Which was how

491
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,360
it was done five, 10 years ago

492
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,840
traditionally.

493
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,240
Yeah. So, BUYME

494
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,400
he's been around for about eight years.

495
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,560
And back then,

496
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,840
when they started the company,

497
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,760
the original entrepreneurs

498
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,437
together with a group,

499
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:19,800
business group called Teleclal

500
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,684
who is actually the owner

501
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:24,560
of BUYME today, that was exactly

502
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,640
the question people ask them,

503
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,000
"Why do I need this?"

504
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,880
You know, there is a lot

505
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,280
of different opportunities

506
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,320
and possibilities to give people gifts

507
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,200
and employees gifts.

508
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,240
And the answer was

509
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,880
that our generation is different.

510
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,160
We want to have the ability

511
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,880
to choose our gifts.

512
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,520
And you saw more and more people

513
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,480
in the private sector

514
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,640
and even in the business sector,

515
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,480
instead of giving gifts to people

516
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,320
they started giving money.

517
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,400
If it's holidays, yeah,

518
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,920
you can buy whatever you want.

519
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,120
If it's in the workplace, yeah,

520
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,040
you'll just get this or that bonus

521
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,640
at the end of the month

522
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,560
because you did a good job

523
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,480
or even if you had a birthday.

524
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,640
And the reason is that

525
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,920
the essence of being able to choose

526
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,560
is very important.

527
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,400
And this is you know,

528
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,680
this is our generation,

529
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,520
this is the time we're living in, 2020

530
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,280
than back then in 2012.

531
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,160
And BUYME saw that.

532
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,240
And using technology,

533
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,220
we have an R&D center

534
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:23,120
of about 20 employees,

535
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,520
using technology,

536
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,840
we were able to connect

537
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,160
more than 1200 businesses

538
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,400
all across Israel.

539
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,360
Wow.

540
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,040
And using one unique code

541
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,480
you were able to use that gift

542
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,520
in any one of those 1200 businesses.

543
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,840
And BUYME, you know,

544
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,760
started the process

545
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,080
of getting people more and more adjusted

546
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,720
and into this new way of giving gifts

547
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,800
and making people happy.

548
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,640
And today we have

549
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,080
about 5,000 business customers,

550
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,680
business clients, companies,

551
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,320
who give gifts

552
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,320
to about one million Israelis.

553
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,880
And we actually started three years ago,

554
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,840
our private sector platform in which

555
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,160
we have hundreds of thousands

556
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,840
of Israelis who give gifts

557
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,320
to the people they care about,

558
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,760
whether it's birthday

559
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,880
someone gave birth, holidays, etc.

560
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,800
And the ability to do something

561
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,400
that is personal,

562
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,040
meaning you can, you know,

563
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,040
you can use our platform

564
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,640
and send them a video, a photo,

565
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,560
you can obviously, you write them

566
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,840
a very personal something

567
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,960
that they will know

568
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,320
what you think about them

569
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,320
and why you are giving them

570
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,000
this particular present.

571
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,280
And all of this created

572
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,040
a personal process

573
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,600
in which people are receiving gifts

574
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,400
and are happy to use them.

575
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,920
And it's amazing.

576
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,280
I think that's remarkable.

577
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,080
And it's one of the things

578
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,320
that I'm always very curious

579
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,040
about this transition.

580
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,560
Because effectively, you know,

581
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,520
you could say here, just take money,

582
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,600
use that money

583
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,920
as the global currency

584
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,960
to buy whatever you want.

585
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,320
But money is not a gift, right?

586
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,760
Money is not personal.

587
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,760
Money is not,

588
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,080
there's no emotions connected to money.

589
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,840
Yet, you're creating this currency

590
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,080
that is emotional,

591
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,960
that is connected to the gift process

592
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,280
of saying, I appreciate you.

593
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,600
I'm not just giving you a bonus,

594
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,160
but I'm appreciating you

595
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,040
for all the hard work

596
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,600
and for the person that you are.

597
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,560
And you're allowing that currency

598
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,480
to be translated

599
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,680
into all these businesses.

600
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,720
And I think that's just such a smart

601
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,440
and innovative way

602
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,040
of thinking about our culture

603
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,760
and our traditions.

604
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:28,520
You know, the currency

605
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
is even more than a gift.

606
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:31,800
The currency and the term we use

607
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,480
is an experience.

608
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,200
We give you the chance to get

609
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,880
a positive experience in your life.

610
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,160
Not many people, not many companies,

611
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,800
can say they do exactly that.

612
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,080
It doesn't matter if you get a gift card

613
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,360
and you choose to use it

614
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,760
to buy something in a H&M, okay.

615
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,520
You can use it to whatever.

616
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,880
You can go to a luxury restaurant.

617
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,600
You can go to a vineyard.

618
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,560
You can do a tour in Tel Aviv

619
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,680
and enjoy the scene.

620
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,600
You can do a lot of different things.

621
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,240
But again, at the essence

622
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,320
is you give a gift

623
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,520
which is actually an experience.

624
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,120
And you create positive moments

625
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,560
in the people you care about in life.

626
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,360
And again, that's amazing.

627
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,480
I love it.

628
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,680
Positive impact on the people,

629
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,920
positive impact on the businesses.

630
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,440
I just love it.

631
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,520
Tomer, thank you so much

632
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,840
for being so generous with your time.

633
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,840
This was just amazing.

634
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,160
And I love that I finally got to learn

635
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,960
about your past life,

636
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,000
which is a full life on its own

637
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,920
for the average person.

638
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,720
So, it's really remarkable.

639
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,600
So, thank you for everything

640
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
that you've done for Israel.

641
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,280
Thank you for everything

642
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,200
you're doing now, for the economy

643
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,440
and for job seekers

644
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,880
and the younger generations.

645
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,560
And for gifting to people all over Israel

646
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,760
and eventually the world.

647
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,440
Before we leave,

648
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,800
I have the final question,

649
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,880
which is three words

650
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,760
that you would use to describe yourself.

651
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,120
I did not think ahead.

652
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,040
So, you know, let's just do this.

653
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,240
The first word is two word

654
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,680
but I combined them with a dash.

655
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,400
So, that's fine I think is do-good.

656
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,040
Of course.

657
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,520
Do good.

658
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,240
The second word is plan.

659
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,400
And as I said, always have a plan.

660
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,600
Plan ahead.

661
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,480
And the third word,

662
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,960
which is actually the first word,

663
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,840
if I had to be completely honest, family.

664
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,640
I love that.

665
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,640
And anybody who's in touch

666
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,840
with you and follow the social media

667
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,320
and you can see

668
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,400
the pictures behind you.

669
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,680
Beautiful kids.

670
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,880
Congratulations on building

671
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,240
such a beautiful family.

672
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,080
And thank you for being

673
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,560
such an inspiration.

674
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,400
Thank you.

675
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,050
Thank you very much

676
00:20:32,051 --> 00:20:32,971
for having me, Michael.

677
00:20:32,972 --> 00:20:33,857
Thank you.
