00
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,600
Raymond Stern, thank you so much

00
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,320
for being on the show

00
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,080
20 Minute Leaders

00
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,640
I really appreciate it.

00
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,160
My pleasure. Glad to be here.

00
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,480
This is gonna be so much fun.

00
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,400
And I'm not gonna be able to do justice

00
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,720
for the insane amount of things

71
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,560
that you've done.

72
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,320
But just as a brief venture,

73
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,440
you did Stanford for your undergrad.

74
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,240
Very proud of that.

75
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,760
And then a Harvard MBA.

76
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,920
Moved on to consulting.

77
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,480
A senior vice president positions

78
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,800
at Intuit and Yahoo

79
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,680
Venture Capital,

80
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,080
a very successful venture capital

81
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,240
and clear path over

82
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,480
the past several years.

83
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,640
But you've also done

84
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,120
the entrepreneurial journey yourself,

85
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,320
which I'd love to hear more about.

86
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,920
Raymond, there's so many things

87
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,480
I want to ask you.

88
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,560
I want to talk about leadership.

89
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,720
I want to talk about scaling,

90
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,120
about team building.

91
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,480
But can you give me a little bit

92
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,840
of a brief intro about who you are

93
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,120
and what excites you?

94
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,120
Yeah. A lot of things excite me,

95
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,280
but I love, I guess first and foremost,

96
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,600
I love helping entrepreneurs.

97
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,080
When I think about my own career,

98
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,200
the thing that I got the biggest kick out

99
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,440
of was helping coach and mentor people,

100
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,640
whether it was at BCG

101
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,880
when I was a partner there

102
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,360
and actually, before I was a partner there

103
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,760
or whether I was at Yahoo or Intuit,

104
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,680
and certainly the work

105
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,200
I do today with entrepreneurs.

106
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,520
And so, that's where I get my biggest kick.

107
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,080
And the thing that gives me the biggest

108
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,120
amount of pride when I meet with people

109
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,760
over time, many years later,

110
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,840
is to see the great things

111
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,040
they've gone on to do

112
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,560
because they're amazingly capable

113
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,760
and feeling like maybe I had one tiny,

114
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,720
tiny little aspect of that

115
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,240
in helping them along the way.

116
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,720
So, looking at these various experiences

117
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,640
from an entrepreneur consultant

118
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,240
and then venture capital,

119
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,320
where do you most attracted to

120
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,720
if you had to choose of these three fields?

121
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,480
So, let me just clarify.

122
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,600
Venture capital, I don't do

123
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,380
a lot of venture capital.

124
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,720
My work is mainly helping

125
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,160
entrepreneurs with my time.

126
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,360
And every so often I invest.

127
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,840
But I just wanted to clarify that

128
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,760
for your audience.

129
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,160
Sure.

130
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,280
Where I really get my kick

131
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,800
is working with the entrepreneurs.

132
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,440
You know, I love my experiences at

133
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,040
BCG and Intuit and at Yahoo.

134
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,840
But I really, really enjoy

135
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,520
the startup environment much more.

136
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,080
And for one main reason.

137
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,200
One, because you can just

138
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,440
get stuff done.

139
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,040
And the pace at which

140
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,600
these organizations move

141
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,640
is radically different than

142
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,360
what you can do at an Intuit or Yahoo

143
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,720
or any larger company.

144
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,800
Now, I think there's a lot to learn

145
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,840
from those larger companies,

146
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
especially as you're trying to scale a business.

147
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,960
And hopefully that's part of what

148
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,040
I bring to the clients that I work with.

149
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,160
Right. Okay.

150
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,440
So, how many entrepreneurs

151
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,560
would you say you've got to work with

152
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
or lend a hand

153
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,280
over these past several decades?

154
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,480
Probably 25 or 30,

155
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,040
where I've really worked with them

156
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,960
pretty intimately.

157
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,760
And at this point in time right now,

158
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,280
I'm working probably actively

159
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,680
with about 10 or 12.

160
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,800
Wow.

161
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,920
And the great thing is

162
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,960
when I work with entrepreneurs,

163
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,000
it tends to be on a long-term basis.

164
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,160
I mean, these are relationships

165
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,400
that I've built over time.

166
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,640
And I get to see them from

167
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,320
the early, early days to companies

168
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,560
that are selling for billions of dollars.

169
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,600
And I've gone on to do some

170
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,520
pretty incredible things.

171
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,120
So, it's a long-term relationship.

172
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,760
And I really enjoy

173
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,560
watching that evolution

174
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,240
and the amazing things they do

175
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,960
with their teams

176
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,360
to build great companies.

177
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,400
Incredible. Okay.

178
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,520
Let's start with your executive positions

179
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,320
within Intuit

180
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,520
and Yahoo's Senior Vice President.

181
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,280
You're basically you're there.

182
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,280
You're helping lead

183
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,880
these billion-dollar businesses

184
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,560
and leave strategy.

185
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,920
What does that even entail?

186
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,160
What is the role

187
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,600
of a senior vice president

188
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,240
at these two incredible companies?

189
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,680
And what are some of the key takeaways

190
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,400
that you would take from those times?

191
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,800
You know, each role is different.

192
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,320
And that depends on the functions

193
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,840
and your meetings.

194
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,320
I have a great opportunity to lead.

195
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,920
As you mentioned, some strategy armaments.

196
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,520
But I also got to lead

197
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,680
a marketing organization.

198
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,600
When I was at Yahoo,

199
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,640
I led the small business

200
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,640
I'm sorry.

201
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,000
In Intuit I lead a small business division.

202
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,280
When I was at Yahoo,

203
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,040
Got a brisk opportunity to lead

204
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,920
some of our operations internationally.

205
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,320
So, it's a pretty diverse set of things.

206
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,560
And obviously you've got to have some

207
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,920
expertise in the area of leading.

208
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,240
But the thing that's common

209
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,440
with every single one of them

210
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,240
is you've got to lead.

211
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,160
I mean, at the end of the day,

212
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,200
when you're at that level

213
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,880
in an organization,

214
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,360
your role is primarily

215
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,360
getting the right people in the organization

216
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,880
and getting them aligned

217
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,040
on the critical priorities

218
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,160
for the organization

219
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,400
and then ensuring

220
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,320
that you're making progress

221
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,520
against those priorities.

222
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,320
And if you're not putting in place processes

223
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,120
to course correct

224
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,000
and get back on track

225
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,040
and things like that.

226
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,080
But ultimately the common

227
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,960
thing is one of leadership.

228
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,560
Assuming you have some reasonable amount

229
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
of domain expertise,

230
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,800
because at that level you're not.

231
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,040
You can't roll up your sleeves

232
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,120
and do everything. Right?

233
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,720
I mean, the organizations are complex

234
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,960
and there's a lot going on

235
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,120
which is very different

236
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,360
than when you're an early stage

237
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,080
entrepreneur.

238
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,440
Where you're rolling up

239
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,400
your sleeves and doing everything.

240
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,360
And one of the challenges

241
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,400
entrepreneurs face as they scale

242
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,520
and grow their organizations

243
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,640
is making that transition

244
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,520
from I do everything

245
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,920
to a higher rate people.

246
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,680
And now I've got to make sure

247
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,760
that they do great work

248
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,520
and have also taken enable that

249
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,080
in a way that's powerful.

250
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,280
So, I'm going to ask a weird question.

251
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,080
What are some of the worst things

252
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,120
that person at the level of

253
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,040
a senior vice president

254
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,720
at a big company can do in

255
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
terms of leadership?

256
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,400
What are some of the don'ts that,

257
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,160
because a lot of the times people

258
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,080
and I ask what should I keep in mind?

259
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,520
And what should I do as a leader?

260
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,000
I want to know what I shouldn't do.

261
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,720
What are some things

262
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,320
that I don't realize

263
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,040
that I might do

264
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,080
and I want to avoid them purposefully?

265
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,440
Yeah, sure. And actually,

266
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,240
the flip side of it

267
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,360
is what makes them great.

268
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,480
So, a negative to negative

269
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,800
then just turn it around

270
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,440
and you'll understand the good part.

271
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,920
I think oftentimes leaders

272
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,920
don't get clarity

273
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,040
on what they're solving for.

274
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,560
And they need to understand

275
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,800
what are the critical levers

276
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,160
that they're responsible for,

277
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,920
that are gonna drive

278
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,320
whatever outcomes they need to drive

279
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,520
to support the success of the company.

280
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,880
That's one thing.

281
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,000
So, if you don't do that,

282
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,720
you're screwed.

283
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,640
Because you're gonna go off

284
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,240
and do stuff in the wrong direction.

285
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,800
Second thing that leaders

286
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,360
don't do as well as they should sometimes

287
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,840
is make sure that everyone is aligned on that.

288
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,120
Because you might know what you're doing.

289
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,960
But if you don't get the entire organization

290
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,280
aligned on the same things,

291
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
you're gonna get people going

292
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,400
in disparate directions.

293
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,160
And at the end of the day,

294
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,400
you won't get to the end result

295
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,560
that you're looking for.

296
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:01,920
Right.

297
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,080
And there's a whole list of things.

298
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,280
But I think the one that

299
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,680
most leaders fail to appreciate

300
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,840
how powerful it can be

301
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,480
if they get it right

302
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,200
is how they allocate their time.

303
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,000
Because if you think about it

304
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,120
learning, if you wanna impact outcomes,

305
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,280
you can learn new skills.

306
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,600
But that can take years

307
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,000
or weeks or months.

308
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,680
Whereas you can decide again

309
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,320
in a heartbeat,

310
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,480
I'm going to stop doing this

311
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,360
and start doing this,

312
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,920
and then you'll have a better impact

313
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,880
on those things.

314
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,600
And that was an early lesson I had

315
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,000
working for a great leader

316
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,920
who came out of GE.

317
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,840
You got him Steve Bennett,

318
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,200
who I worked for many years

319
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,520
when I was at Intuit.

320
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,960
And I just found that to be

321
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,200
incredibly powerful.

322
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,040
And I think people who don't

323
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,840
manage their time well

324
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,280
fail as leaders.

325
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,760
Whether at a Fortune 500 company

326
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,920
or a brand-new startup.

327
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,880
The most critical thing

328
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
you need to think about is,

329
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,240
where am I gonna spend my time?

330
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,840
Because that's the most

331
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,880
precious commodity you have.

332
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,400
And at a Fortune 500 company,

333
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
you're generally not worried

334
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,560
about having enough money,

335
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,840
whereas the most precious commodity

336
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,320
startup has is just making sure

337
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,520
they have enough oxygen.

338
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,240
Definitely.

339
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,040
I had a fascinating conversation

340
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,120
with the CEO of Super Tools,

341
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,840
the productivity company in Israel,

342
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,220
and he's now developing

343
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,520
a new type of calendar

344
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,600
where they're thinking

345
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,920
of taking the ownership over your time-slots

346
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,480
through time blocking

347
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,360
and different best practices.

348
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,680
And one of the things we're talking about

349
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,680
is how we very easily can become slaves

350
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,520
of our own calendars.

351
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,720
And instead of the calendar working for us,

352
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,760
we work for our calendar

353
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,960
and chasing our own tail.

354
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,120
I see that with myself all the time.

355
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,880
So, what can you do though, as an executive?

356
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,840
Because you have everybody

357
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,520
wants to meet you.

358
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,280
Your calendar is full

359
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,240
from like weeks in advance.

360
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,640
So, how do you take ownership

361
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,000
over your time?

362
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,160
How do you actually sit back

363
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,120
and think properly?

364
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,000
What are the priorities

365
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,080
that you should be focused on?

366
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:49,920
So, I mean,

367
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,440
I think it ties to the word you just said,

368
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,680
which is what of the priorities

369
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,280
you wanna allocate your time.

370
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,560
So, is not whoever wants my time.

371
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,360
Can I have my time?

372
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:56,640
Right.

373
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:56,840
Right.

374
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,880
You wanna invest your time in there.

375
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,880
And that's different than saying

376
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,080
I'm gonna be accessible

377
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,720
and make time for people to find me

378
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,400
if they need to

379
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,360
But you structure that.

380
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,680
You don't make that on demand

381
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,720
whenever you want.

382
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,840
And I believe strongly that

383
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,680
making time to engage with the broader

384
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,080
set of employees in the organization

385
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,480
is important and certainly with your

386
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,560
direct reports at the next level down.

387
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,960
So, you wanna explicitly

388
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,360
make time for that.

389
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,840
So, that's one of the critical priorities.

390
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,640
Spending time with your

391
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,960
direct reports as an example.

392
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,560
But it really is about being

393
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,040
really rigorous on investing

394
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,480
your time in those areas.

395
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,640
So, one is just know what your

396
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,600
priorities are and you should do it.

397
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:36,520
The second is we tend to be creatures of

398
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,960
what my calendar says and so if it says

399
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,800
I have a one-hour meeting,

400
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,880
I'm going to have a one-hour meeting.

401
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:40,800
And the reality is,

402
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,080
if I'm done in 30 minutes,

403
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,360
I'm done with a meeting.

404
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,560
And I find that, I create all sorts

405
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,920
of pockets of time throughout my day.

406
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,440
And used to do this an executive,

407
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,920
because I never went

408
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,120
back to back to back.

409
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,400
I would end things early,

410
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,520
Just because my calendar said

411
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,280
it was an hour,

412
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
Didn't mean I was going to take an hour.

413
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,280
So, you're actually the fight

414
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,960
Parkinson's law, right?

415
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,120
Yeah.

416
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,120
The other thing you need to do

417
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,080
is make sure that the people

418
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,800
you're meeting with

419
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,320
are being respectful of your time.

420
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,600
So, for example,

421
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,640
I don't like having meandering meetings

422
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,920
just at random subjects

423
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,480
when I have a one on one.

424
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,360
It's focused on the critical priorities.

425
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,560
How are we doing against them?

426
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,400
How can I help?

427
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,800
What are we doing to get back on track?

428
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,440
And opportunities to give people feedback, etc.

429
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,880
And it doesn't mean you don't allow

430
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,800
some time for chitchat and be asked

431
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,200
on how you doing or things like that.

432
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,000
Because that's important.

433
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,760
It's an important part of a relationship.

434
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,200
And I also just love doing that

435
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,880
as a human being.

436
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,600
But it does mean that you expect

437
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,320
the others to be disciplined about

438
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,720
the conversations they're having.

439
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,200
And the way I do that

440
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,920
is just encourage everyone.

441
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,400
And I talk a lot with entrepreneurs

442
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,240
about this when you're having

443
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,440
one on one with people.

444
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,200
Make sure there's a specific agenda.

445
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,120
This isn't like

446
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,240
what you feel talking about today.

447
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,320
And in general, that agenda should be tied

448
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,120
to what are the most important priorities

449
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,920
that they're working on

450
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,520
to deliver results from the business.

451
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,520
I had one of the most incredible leaders

452
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,160
in my unit in 8200,

453
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,320
that he would not be willing to meet

454
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,600
with anybody unless they send him

455
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
an agenda ahead of time.

456
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,240
And it had to be in a proper format

457
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,920
as a part of the calendar invite.

458
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,160
And that was because he was just working,

459
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,680
8AM to 8PM nonstop,

460
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,480
back to back meetings,

461
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,560
that he had to choose

462
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,360
which ones are most important.

463
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,800
But Raymond, then most important question

464
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,000
of the interview so far.

465
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,560
What is this background behind you?

466
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,080
Which beach are we at?

467
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,880
Oh, well, shouldn't I let you guess?

468
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,440
You ought to know.

469
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,240
Given where you come from.

470
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm gonna guess Tel Baruch Beach.

471
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,080
But I might be wrong.

472
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,760
It's Banana beach.

473
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:31,560
It's Banana beach.

474
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,120
Well, I'm from Tel Baruch.

475
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,080
So, this is a,

476
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,720
You know, I was there last summer

477
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,040
having a great visit with family

478
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,360
and also doing a little bit of work

479
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,680
with some of my clients.

480
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,960
And I put it out this June

481
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,760
since we couldn't travel to Israel.

482
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,080
And I just wanted to be reminded

483
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,960
of how wonderful the summer is there.

484
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,720
And you can probably tell

485
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,080
from the plastic chairs

486
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,440
and the plastic bags with all the junk

487
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,840
Yeah. Definitely.

488
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,200
But really, the sunset gives it all

489
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,480
because there's nothing like the

490
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,160
Tel Aviv sunset.

491
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,400
But we're getting way off topic.

492
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,120
Raymond, talk to me a little bit

493
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,920
about scale.

494
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,680
What are some of the key challenges

495
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,040
that entrepreneurs face

496
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,320
as they get to a point

497
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,320
where they're able to scale

498
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,400
their business upwards?

499
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,560
And I’m talking now

500
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,680
as the young entrepreneur myself,

501
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,640
that I didn't have yet the privilege

502
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,560
of getting to that position,

503
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,080
but I can't wait to get there.

504
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,840
And when I do get there,

505
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,760
I want to keep these things in mind.

506
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,080
Right.

507
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,680
So, in my experience,

508
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,760
what makes an entrepreneur

509
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,640
incredibly successful are the things

510
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,080
that can kill them down the road

511
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,960
if they don't adapt.

512
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,920
And so, what do I mean by that?

513
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,600
In the early days, as you know,

514
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,000
and you've talked to many entrepreneurs

515
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:36,600
and not many but,

516
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,680
you have to do everything yourself.

517
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,280
And by definition,

518
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,240
you're a micromanager.

519
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,560
You're doing everything yourself.

520
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,240
And so, that's one aspect.

521
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,360
And processes even if you have 10 people

522
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,040
who pull them together,

523
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,680
you get in a room,

524
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,600
you talk, you leave.

525
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,240
Right. It's pretty simple.

526
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,040
But as complexity goes up,

527
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,600
those processes break down.

528
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,800
And so, you need to think about

529
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,960
what are some processes

530
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,440
to drive alignment

531
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,880
to know how we're doing.

532
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,800
And that's when companies

533
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,920
start putting in place.

534
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,160
Okay, our processes,

535
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,040
And again, you need to do it

536
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,840
intelligently, not overkill,

537
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,600
and stifle an organization.

538
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,240
So, processes is something

539
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,960
you need to think about.

540
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,400
How you use your own time. Right.

541
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,720
If you hire awesome people

542
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,040
who are world class

543
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,640
when you're scaling and growing

544
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,240
and have the luxury to hire them

545
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,080
because in the early days

546
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,640
you can't hire them.

547
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,600
You can't afford them

548
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,880
and you don't need them.

549
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,680
And so, when you hire them,

550
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,280
the mistake I see entrepreneurs

551
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,360
sometimes make is they still manage them

552
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,200
the way they were micromanaging

553
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,400
when they had four people

554
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,400
in the company.

555
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,040
And the reality is, if you do that,

556
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,040
you'll just piss off a bunch of great people

557
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,000
and they'll leave.

558
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,520
And so, you won't be off the scale

559
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,840
because you won't get the talent

560
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,440
that you need

561
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,520
to build an organization.

562
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:51,080
So, for me, it comes down primarily to

563
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,520
how you lead and manage

564
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:56,880
in terms of the role you play.

565
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,200
By enabling others

566
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,640
versus doing it all yourself

567
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,840
and making sure you learn to let go.

568
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,040
Obviously, you've got to trust

569
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,360
those individuals and then

570
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,280
you need to develop that trust.

571
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:08,960
And then secondly,

572
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,160
putting in place processes

573
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,560
for sort of broader management

574
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,080
of the company.

575
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,920
Whether it's staff meetings,

576
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,120
alignment processes.

577
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,320
Okay our processes

578
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,480
because the processes you used

579
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
in the early days just don't scale

580
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,960
when you get past 30 or 40 people.

581
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,800
And certainly, when you

582
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,680
get into the hundreds.

583
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,760
They just don't like.

584
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,240
Doesn't mean you can't keep some

585
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,560
of the cultural aspects

586
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,800
and successful companies do.

587
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,560
Doesn't mean you can can't keep some

588
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,800
elements of those things

589
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,880
like all hands of meetings every Friday

590
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,040
or things like that.

591
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,560
But even that eventually breaks down

592
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,840
when you're in multiple geographies

593
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,920
and people are sleeping doing wrong.

594
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,360
But then as young entrepreneurs,

595
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,400
first time entrepreneurs

596
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,520
going through this journey,

597
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,480
first time you hit employee number 31,

598
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,200
how do you even know what to do?

599
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,840
I mean, it's not like there is a text book

600
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,840
that you can just go to and say,

601
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,000
"Okay. This is how you now can go."

602
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,520
"And these are the processes

603
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,000
you should keep."

604
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,320
"These are the processes you shouldn't."

605
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,360
Maybe an MBA is maybe they have

606
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,320
some relevant classes.

607
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,560
But how do entrepreneurs

608
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,080
get this information?

609
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,040
I mean, I think most of it comes from

610
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,240
just talking to people or experience. Right?

611
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,760
I mean, and then in a large part,

612
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,840
that's the role I play.

613
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,720
But many others do.

614
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,600
There are advisers.

615
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,320
They are experienced people

616
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,280
who can help you do it.

617
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,400
And I think the critical thing

618
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,600
is not to do it when you hit employee 31,

619
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,440
but to anticipate and do it

620
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,600
so that you are there

621
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,640
when you hit employee 31.

622
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,160
And you don't all of a sudden wake up

623
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,320
and go, "Oh, shit, it's not working."

624
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,880
Right.

625
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:37,320
And so, anticipating those critical milestones

626
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,600
and they're not as hard wired as 30 or 40 or 50,

627
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,120
it's more just thinking about,

628
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,680
"Okay, we've been working

629
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,560
with our friends in a room

630
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,900
and we can talk about priorities

631
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,360
and now we need to start thinking

632
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,720
about more formal process."

633
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,040
And so, what do those look like?

634
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,240
And maybe it's something like,

635
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,800
okay or some other approach

636
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,560
to setting priorities,

637
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,120
maybe at staff meetings

638
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,200
as opposed to informal staff meetings

639
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,480
at some point building a more formality.

640
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,440
And what I mean by that

641
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,680
is going through the critical priorities.

642
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,240
Are we red, yellow, green on these?

643
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,920
Talking about

644
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,280
what we're doing with the red one's

645
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,600
talking about as a team,

646
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,640
how are we going to improve them.

647
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,480
As opposed to a stand up

648
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,640
where we just go around the room

649
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,520
and talk about whatever

650
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,070
we think we want to talk about?

651
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,680
Definitely. Okay.

652
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,960
So, again, it's the anticipation

653
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,160
and putting it in place

654
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,000
so that you don't get,

655
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,360
what ends up happening is

656
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,560
some companies wait too long

657
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,600
and then they grind to a halt

658
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,040
because what ends up happening is

659
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,750
the complexity kills them.

660
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,680
You know, all of a sudden

661
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,440
you can't know everything

662
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,160
that's going on.

663
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,040
You can't keep an organization

664
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,200
completely aligned

665
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,030
when it's a 50, 60, 70 or 100 people.

666
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,750
I love it. Okay.

667
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,960
So, I'm taking priorities

668
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,590
from leadership as an executive.

669
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,750
I'm taking anticipation

670
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,040
as an entrepreneur to scale up.

671
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,110
Let's talk about teams.

672
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,400
What are some of your insights

673
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,800
seeing dozens of entrepreneurs

674
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,350
successful and unsuccessful.

675
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,200
What makes a really, really good team,

676
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,240
not just the founding team,

677
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,720
but being a good, solid team

678
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,520
that is able to take a business,

679
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,550
prove it

680
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,550
and start scaling it upwards.

681
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,320
Yeah, I think, there's are a bunch

682
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,800
of things that make teams great.

683
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:11,160
And I've learned a lot of this

684
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,280
from some of the great leaders

685
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,480
that I've had the opportunity

686
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,270
to work for.

687
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,160
And so, let me just give you some ideas.

688
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,920
These are not in any particular order.

689
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,880
They're all important.

690
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,640
But a great team gets back to power

691
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,790
if they know what they're solving for.

692
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,030
Right.

693
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,920
And if you randomly grabbed anyone

694
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,760
from that team and said,

695
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,800
"What are the five most important

696
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,600
priorities of the company?"

697
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,550
they ought to be able to answer that.

698
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,550
And if they don't, there's a disconnection.

699
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,070
Teams are really aligned on that.

700
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,480
Is that also important

701
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,200
when the company is huge,

702
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,880
let's say 200 people?

703
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,360
I think certainly an executive team

704
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,240
needs to do it.

705
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,400
I would like for everyone,

706
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,960
but if the people sitting around the table

707
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,880
aren't selling for the same thing.

708
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,720
You've got a problem

709
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,200
sitting around the executive table.

710
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,000
If someone further down the organization

711
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,160
doesn't remember all of that,

712
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,110
but they know what they work on,

713
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,200
and they know ideally, they know

714
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,680
how it supports what a company's

715
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,680
priorities are.

716
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,310
So, yeah, I think this notion of everyone

717
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,080
knows what the critical priorities

718
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,830
are for the organization.

719
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,120
But there a bunch of other aspects, too,

720
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,030
that I kind of alluded to it a second ago.

721
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,000
This alignment piece,

722
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,400
you want to make sure that everyone,

723
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,720
an organization is aligned

724
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,840
in supporting those objectives.

725
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,680
You don't want people

726
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,680
working on stuff that doesn't fit.

727
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,080
Because, one, they're not gonna

728
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,600
feel good about working on stuff

729
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,680
that doesn't matter.

730
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,240
Secondly, it's a waste of resources.

731
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,960
You're not gonna be efficient and optimal

732
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,040
in terms of how you use

733
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,590
your limited capacity.

734
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,080
You know, other things great teams

735
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,640
do really well is they can balance

736
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,880
long term and short term.

737
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,120
You know, it's really easy

738
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,480
to solve for the near-term thing.

739
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,680
And it's really easy

740
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,590
to solve for the long term.

741
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,120
The hard thing is to balance those.

742
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,960
And you need to balance

743
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,550
because you've got to deliver for today.

744
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,960
But you also have to deliver in the future

745
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,240
when the products of today

746
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,800
aren't the most critical ones.

747
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,280
You've got to evolve those products.

748
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,270
You gotta think about new opportunities.

749
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,040
So that's another one

750
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,160
that great teams really do.

751
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,160
They balance those.

752
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,920
And that's a tough thing

753
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,320
because you're always gonna be pushed

754
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,560
to put the resources

755
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,040
on the things that deliver today.

756
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,880
And that's the classic

757
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,960
innovator's dilemma, right?

758
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,070
People, who don't invest in the future.

759
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,240
And I've seen companies get

760
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,160
really screwed by that over time.

761
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,000
The other thing to think about

762
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,720
is that I think great teams do

763
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,790
is they're clear on who owns decisions.

764
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,790
And there's a big difference between

765
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,920
Having input and owning a decision.

766
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,880
Great teams want the best input.

767
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,400
But this isn't a consensus.

768
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,030
Let's vote,

769
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,160
do you wanna be clear on

770
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,240
who owns the decision?

771
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:42,880
And ultimately,

772
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,400
a CEO owns all decisions

773
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,720
But you wanna be clear on

774
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,160
who owns those so that you can have,

775
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,310
if you aren't clear,

776
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,680
then the organizations are confused.

777
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,040
Or someone makes a decision

778
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,550
and someone overrides a decision.

779
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,640
And so, you want to make sure

780
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,720
that everyone's clear on

781
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,550
who owns the decision.

782
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,360
But at the same time,

783
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,510
allow for the great input.

784
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,880
Because you want the best thinking

785
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,440
brought to bear.

786
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,480
But I could go on with a whole list of things

787
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,250
so, do you want me to keep going

788
00:21:11,255 --> 00:21:12,280
or pick some other topic?

789
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,240
This is just good and I can't believe

790
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,320
20 minutes are almost up.

791
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,680
I'm shocked every single time

792
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,240
and every time I think to myself,

793
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,480
I should have called this show

794
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,360
30-minute leaders.

795
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,590
Not 20-minute leaders.

796
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,000
I don't know why I cut myself short

797
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,310
of ten minutes of pure knowledge.

798
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,590
But Raymond, before we leave,

799
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,800
I want to ask for one key of advice

800
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,640
that you would give me

801
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,240
as a young entrepreneur

802
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,360
soon as starting my entrepreneurial journey,

803
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,640
hopefully sooner rather than later

804
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,200
with my own venture.

805
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:40,040
What are the two top things

806
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,590
that I should be keeping in mind

807
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,240
as I go on this crazy path?

808
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,280
So, I think the number one thing is

809
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,120
make sure you really believe

810
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,480
in what you're doing.

811
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,280
Because inevitably, I mean,

812
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,520
you've heard this a million times,

813
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:59,720
at every corner there's gonna be a barrier.

814
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,600
It's hard to raise money.

815
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,240
And even the successful entrepreneurs

816
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,310
will tell you at some point it was hard.

817
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,800
You're gonna have challenges

818
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,000
in doing what you need to do

819
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,200
in terms of managing the product

820
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,280
or creating a brand.

821
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,680
People are gonna tell you, "No."

822
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,880
You're going to struggle getting

823
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,040
distribution deals or whatever it is

824
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,640
you're trying to do

825
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:15,920
to build your business.

826
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,400
You're gonna lose great people

827
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,120
and you're gonna feel

828
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,120
it's the end of the world

829
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,310
because I just lost my VP of engineering.

830
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,040
And so, you gonna continually

831
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,880
be facing these roadblocks.

832
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,720
And it's really, really hard.

833
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:27,960
So, you better make sure

834
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,920
you really believe in it and want to do it

835
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,640
and that you're not doing it just because,

836
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,160
"Hey, this is a quick way to make a buck."

837
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,840
And I'm not saying you're doing that at all,

838
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,040
but there are you know,

839
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,960
sometimes I meet entrepreneurs that I,

840
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,200
I don't really get that they

841
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,000
truly, truly believe in it.

842
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,040
And I don't mean in the,

843
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,640
"Hey, I want to change the world."

844
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,160
But they're passionate about what they do

845
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,920
and they're willing to go

846
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,760
through all the battles.

847
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,680
And I think that's the most important.

848
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,000
The second thing I would say

849
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,200
that is most important and it ties to

850
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,760
what we were talking about before,

851
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:04,920
is really about this being

852
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,920
really, really clear on the critical priorities.

853
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:11,160
Because your time is so valuable.

854
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,360
You don't have a lot of resources,

855
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,830
either people or money.

856
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,200
So, you've got to make sure

857
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,280
you optimize for those.

858
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:21,960
And I find too far,

859
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,400
in many cases that entrepreneurs,

860
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,800
they're just trying to do much.

861
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:30,040
And just declare for yourself what those are

862
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,200
and focus on those

863
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,000
and try not to get sucked

864
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
into all the noise around you

865
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,240
because there's got to be plenty of it.

866
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,600
And think about what those critical

867
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,400
things are for your business.

868
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,110
Wonderful.

869
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,520
Raymond, thank you so much

870
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,360
for your time. Toda raba.

871
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,280
It's so generous of you.

872
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,310
But before we leave, I need three words

873
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,600
that you would use to describe yourself.

874
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,550
With the explanation or just the words?

875
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,520
With a little explanation

876
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,790
would be wonderful.

877
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,830
Okay.

878
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,200
First and foremost, family.

879
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,310
I love spending time with my wife and kids.

880
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,720
We travel a lot.

881
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,880
Although not recently.

882
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,040
And we're just hanging out at home.

883
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,790
And covid brought even my kid at college.

884
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,000
We're all here together.

885
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:11,110
And really, the silver lining is all of it.

886
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,760
We're getting to spend

887
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,880
some great time together.

888
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,960
We love spending time together here

889
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,400
up in Tahoe and things like that.

890
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,800
Secondly, it's just, I guess Adaptable.

891
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,640
I've moved around a lot.

892
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,350
I was born in South Africa.

893
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,440
We moved to Israel when I was younger

894
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,520
and then ultimately made our

895
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,160
way to the United States.

896
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,550
And I came at Stanford.

897
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,120
You learn when you're a young kid

898
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,800
moving around a lot, you just learn.

899
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,480
You got to figure out how to survive

900
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,320
and adapt and fit in

901
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,480
and make a go of things.

902
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,550
I can definitely relate to that. Yeah.

903
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,760
And then finally, Ironman. And I've done

904
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,981
Ironman triathlons,

905
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,370
Full Ironman?

906
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,830
Multiple full Ironmans.

907
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,480
We should talk about this the whole time.

908
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,720
Not entrepreneurship.

909
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,880
This is the most interesting.

910
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,360
Wow.

911
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,790
Okay, well, let's set it all up a follow up on this.

912
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,720
But I'm dealing with some injuries now.

913
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,600
So, I'm not sure if there are

914
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,110
any future Ironmans.

915
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,680
But it was a great mental challenge

916
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,240
and physical one, obviously.

917
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,200
So, yeah, those are the three things.

918
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,000
Unbelievable. I was registered

919
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,040
for a half Ironman

920
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,070
in about three days before

921
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,000
covid really took over.

922
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,790
It was up in Napa Valley.

923
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,520
And so, I'm definitely

924
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,720
a way out of shape now.

925
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:22,440
So, I'm using that as an excuse to say

926
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,720
that if it would have happened,

927
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,400
I would have done it.

928
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,480
Now, I don't feel like I have to do it,

929
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,800
but hopefully I don't.

930
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,590
Is that the one in Santa Rosa?

931
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,200
I think it was.

932
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,200
It's called the Napa Valley Ironman

933
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,920
Okay okay okay.

934
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,440
So, hopefully next year. But we'll see.

935
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,320
Yeah, definitely do it.

936
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,920
And you'll discover it's life changing.

937
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,480
I'm sure. I'm sure.

938
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,720
Raymond, thank you very, very much.

939
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,110
We didn't even talk about J-Ventures.

940
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,080
But I wanna thank you for being so inspiring

941
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,400
and teaching through that as well.

942
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:49,590
So, thank you for your help over there.

943
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,800
And thank you for your time

944
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,920
and best of luck through this

945
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,830
crazy, crazy time.

946
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,400
My pleasure Michael.
