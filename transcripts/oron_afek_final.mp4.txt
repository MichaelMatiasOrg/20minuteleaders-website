1 This is a super fragmented environment. Right? Now, when every insurance company is trying to do their own thing and try to propose its own model and it's not unified and it's not tapping into the same data feeds and incentives and it's so fragmented, there's no way something meaningful can happen Oron Afek, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? I'm good, Michael. Thanks for having me here. So, two really interesting things to start off. First of all, you're in Wyoming, right? Even though you're based out of San Francisco. Yeah, yeah. What is that about? After corona started, my wife and I decided to just, you know, take this journey and start working remotely from multiple places. And I've been living in the US for seven years now. And it's the first time I actually experiencing it from the ground, instead of from the air. You know, those little, 20 minute trips from the airport into a meeting back to the airport. It's for the first time I can experience the nature. And Jackson Hole, Wyoming, was one of the more attractive destinations for us to spend some time. So, trying to work from the road now. And it's been amazing. I love it. I love it. So, just as fascinating as that is, you also do Ironman, right, yearly? Yeah. Trying to keep in mental shape, and it comes with a physical requirement. So, I try to, I originally started to do it for just for the challenge. But over the time, it's been like a mental therapy and a great travel destination thing. So, you know, I've been in New Zealand, I've been in Mexico. Places I wouldn't go otherwise if I hadn't had you know, an event. It is unbelievable. So, you know, for a lot of people doing these Ironmans are almost a full time job because of how intense they are. So, just for the ear, tell me a little bit about what is the distance for the running, cycling, and for the swimming portions? Yeah. Well, the folks are doing it full time job, actually good athletes are. I don't consider myself a good athlete. I just do it for the sport. So, the distances would be, you know, 3.8 kilometer swim, followed by 180 kilometer bike ride, and with a marathon finish. So, it's pretty intense. It sounds very, very intense. And I'm sure that just as intense as the Ironman experience, is running a startup in the health space and med tech space is just as intense. So, tell me a little bit about about what VIM is, the company that you're currently running. Yeah. Sure. So, VIM is something we started back in 2015, you know, maybe a year or longer, if you consider the time it takes to plan and to get ready to get a company funded and get off the ground. VIM is a operating system for health care networks. So, we operate solely in the United States, which is a story by itself how we got here and how we started this thing here in the US, a bunch of Israelis. But think about it this way. In Israel, we have two or three large HMOs, health maintenance organizations like Maccabi, Leumit, and so on and so forth, similar to Kaiser, maybe here in the US. Fully integrated payer and medical provider are part of the same entity. So, full alignment of interest. And everything is very streamlined. The physician would like to see you to prevent costs from happening. In the US, it's kind of different. The system here was established as a fee for service system. So, it's what you would maybe know from a world of lawyers or accountants, you know, people that would bill you by the hour, time and material, right? So, physicians here actually have the wrong incentive, in my opinion. Which is, you know, treat you when you're sick. There is a lack of incentive of keeping you healthy. There's an incentive to render more care when you're getting sick. This also is driven because of this separation or the institutional separation between the payer and the provider. So, you have insurance companies on one end, Unitedhealthcare, Cigna and so on and so forth, and you have medical providers. In your case, you're probably very familiar with Stanford, Sutter Health and all those guys. So, basically the separation between church and state is actually not good in healthcare. A dismissal of incentive, given that physicians are actually charging on a fee for service basis, hence they render more care, they're getting paid more. And the insurance companies would like to get to pay less to maintain profitability. And that inherent conflict of interest combined with the IT fragmentation is a huge problem resulting in this almost four trillion dollar cost. Which is three times more per capita than any other OECD country. So, what VIM does in all this chaos, By the way, Oron, you know, while we're saying this, you know, I understand the magnitude of what you're saying, and while you're talking about this, all I'm thinking about is that at VIM, you have millions of Americans at the end of the day through all of this, you know, misalignment, and through all this disincentives that we're introducing into the economy, we have millions of Americans that just don't have proper health benefits and they don't get taken care of when they need. They get sick when they don't need to get sick. And when they do get sick, they can't pay the bills. And so, obviously, you know, on one hand, a lot of people are going out and they're solving these trillion dollar problems, that of misalignment in the economy. But what you're doing here, even more than that, you're actually working on on improving people's lives. Which not every startup can come and say that you're directly impacting whether a person perhaps lives or not, or gets to get treatment when they do get sick. So that's just, to put in perspective, it's a huge problem. I believe more than half of Americans don't have $400 in their bank accounts to pay in the case of emergency. And so, you know, it's even greater when it's a fee for service type of model. But sorry. Go ahead. No. I appreciate you mentioning the saying. You know, it's easy to forget sometimes that we're doing something that is very special and helpful for people. And, you know, myself and the company in particular, are very driven people. And we're doing it, first and foremost to make a difference, not for economical reasons. We truly believe there is a huge financial opportunity side by side with fixing the system just by taking the excess cost out of the system. Yeah. So, it's incredible. And you mentioned 50% of Americans have less than $400 or less available cash in their account at any given time. Take this into consideration with the huge deductibles that people need to pay before their insurance even kicks in. Because during the past 15 years, there was a huge shift to cost to the patients, right? So, insurance companies would just be puzzled of how they're going to pay those bills and say, let's prevent people from using the health care in the first place by shifting more costs and making you responsible, so they stop being opportunistic. So, the average family deductible is now 3500 bucks for a year, per year. And with 400 bucks for 50% Americans, it means no access to health care. So, I mean, look, we can't do everything we want, right. So, VIM had to focus on one area where we can actually, make a difference. So, what we've been focusing on the past five years is actually building this connectivity tissue between insurance companies and physicians. Now, physicians is not a physician, so you have like maybe a thousand different, we call them EMRs, electronic health records or electronic medical records, you know, those old operating system that sit on those provider offices and maintain the data and help to prescribe drugs and so on and so forth. And obviously billing. Which is the main function of those systems. And those systems don't talk with each other, and they don't talk with the insurance company. So, we make them all talk and enable ease of access to data and ease of transfer of data. And what we believe this is going to become, we believe it's going to become the operating system of the network of health care and thus become the the ground work or the infrastructure for value based care. What is value based care? It's a world where incentives are aligned between insurance companies and physicians. So, doctors are rendering care in order to get you healthier. And they're actually enjoying the downstream cost savings of your health. That's what they actually monetize, not the individual service. So, think about a physician who is incentivized to render better care and for your long term benefit in keeping healthy. That's how she's actually making money downstream, not from rendering more care, but by rendering less care. And to actually make this happen, you need connectivity, you need data to flow, you need incentives to flow. And that's what VIM does. VIM is building this operating system to enable value base care. And we are very passionate about it. So, I'm deeply curious about what you're saying. I just need another explanation here just to make sure I fully understand. So, how do you change the alignment so that a physician doesn't get the value from the service, but gets a value from the patient's well-being? How does that work? I understand the connectivity between the systems and the fact that you need some sort of operating system to handle all that communication across the board. But how does that change the incentive of the physician versus the insurance company? Because today, swiping the credit card happens at the time of the ailment. Right? Yeah. Absolutely. So it's a really good question, Michael. So, I think the rule of thumb is is in one word is, capitation. If you think about a doctor in Israel or Australia or in the UK, whatever single payer system you can think about, they're getting a salary. And that salary is adjusted in accordance with the number of patient they see. So, think about moving to a similar model where the primary care physician, the GP, the person who are managing your total health, she's making a PMPM. Per member per month fee. Let's say she's making 600 bucks per month for the patient's health. Right? If it's an older patient, let's say that they consume more care. If it's a younger patient, maybe 250, 300 bucks a month for the patient's care. Right? So, she's getting that. And she is responsible for the total cost of care of that patient. Wow. So, from now on, she becomes a mini insurance company. And on the back end, you have infrastructure supporting stop loss and other things. You guys may be familiar in your other day job that you guys are thinking about all day how do you ensure the insurance companies, right, and so on and so forth. But assuming she has this infrastructure behind her, she's basically able to be rendering more care to prevent downstream cost. And she's fully incentivized to do so because she's getting that PMPM. By the way, it's amazing because think about coronavirus, those physicians been struggling with having office visits and people come to them. They've been losing most of their business in the first months of coronavirus because people didn't show up. They didn't go to see the doctor. If the doctor gets paid PMPM, it's getting paid whatever happens, right. So, now you see this huge willingness of doctors to switch their model into a PMPM capitated model. So, that's an amazing thing that happened in the past year. So, that's what we also see a big growth for our opportunity. And then we have specialists. The specialists are not primary care physicians. They don't need to think about people's total health. They need to think about specific condition and procedures to render. And so, there's a different type of capitation that may happening for specialists. I think about it as bundle payments. So instead of let's say someone is giving birth and seeing a 300 page bill with three thousand line items that say, that breaks down the anesthesia and the hospitalization and the consultations and the MRIs and the CT-scans and the ultrasounds and whatever happens in that specific episode, instead you have a surgeon who would say, I'm going to do this delivery in $30,0000. Whatever happens, happens. And I'm responsible for total cost of care for that episode. So, if you cap the PCP, the primary care, the GP on a per member per month basis, and you cap a specialist on an episode basis, you can really form a marketplace, right, of value based care. You stop paying for services. You're paying for people's health by incentivizing in their own a per service basis capped or on a per member per month basis capped. You incentivize the individuals to just do what's good for the system. And I believe you see, I actually believe it's the, and it's a longer conversation than 20 minutes, but I believe it's actually the answer for other health systems like Israel and the UK and Australia, where the single payer system is bankrupting because of over demand for private services. So, I actually think this can solve all the Western world problems. If we can actually build this model. Oron, how do you get to educate a new market in health and creating a new economy between customer, patient, doctor relationship and insurance, that whole triangle? You know, this is something that the US has been dealing it with for many years. Obama, obviously, put it at the forefront of his campaign, this idea of how do we provide accessible health care. We've seen the disastrous rollout of Obamacare very unfortunately, because I think it served a fantastic purpose of fundamentally allowing people access to health care, which you're giving that same access, but in a different, and perhaps, even more meaningful way. What leads you to go and create this whole new economy and new marketplace for doctors, for physicians, insurance companies and patients? Yeah. I think these are two great question. So, the first question, maybe, I'll start with answering this like what's different in what we do. Because it's obviously the approach I'm presenting is not my idea. People have been thinking about it for 50 years now. But I think there's something different in what we do over what we've done before. And the second question is like, why are we doing it. Why we approach this problem and what kind of motivated. So, let me answer the first question first. So, you know, I mean, every physician in the United States is on average, is contracted with, you know, one large federal insurance, usually Medicare, purely responsible for 50% of my business as a doctor. And then another 20 or so insurance companies, commercial insurance companies, some of them are seeing Medicare advantage, some of them seeing commercial population like large employers, whatever, this is a super fragmented environment. Now, when every insurance company is trying to do her own thing and try to propose its own model, and it's not unified and it's not tapping into the same data feeds and incentives and it's so fragmented, there is no way something meaningful can happen. And the doctors not adopting those offerings because they only apply for a small subset of their patients. What VIM does is that we aggregate those insurance companies. And we're proud to have to serve the largest insurance companies in the United States. So, think about Anthem, UnitedHealthcare, those two companies alone have almost a hundred million Americans covered under them. Right? And you're probably familiar with both. And we cover additional ones. So, I think as an aggregator of insurance companies, we're actually able to represent a bigger portion of membership and talk with physicians in a way that it appeals to them to really change behavior and alter the incentives and so on and so forth. As per the second question is, I guess, it's a more difficult question. What led us to start. So, I can personally speak for myself. My co-founders can tell their own story. Yael and Asaf, will be delighted to be on your show. But my personal story is just frustration. Pure frustration from my own personal career. I was actually very much enjoying my time in the military. I feel I'm contributing. I feel like I'm making a difference. And then, you know, when I started to become an entrepreneur, basically, I never really worked for a company. I was trying to start my own thing. And I think the two main companies I was involved, one is in the telecommunications space selling to large mobile operators. And the other one is in the gaming space selling to big gambling, online gaming companies. And not to discount any of the values of those two areas are driving for the world. I haven't felt fulfilled and driven doing those things. I felt like the economical impact on my personal life was pretty much gone after I made, you know, I would say a little, a little pocket of change that I could afford to pay rent and maybe some more. And I felt like that's not really making any more difference for me. I'm trying to really think about something that will make a difference. And the first thing, it wasn't health care. The first thing was I want to start a business with mechanics that I'll be passionate about. And I put a spreadsheet and I said, this will exercise, you know, if I could start any type of company, 10 years ago, what I would start in the names on the spreadsheet were Amazon and Uber and Airbnb. And, you know, it wasn't Google, it was Apple. It wasn't any of these. Right? And I was thinking, what is the common denominator. And I saw that marketplaces is what I'm really passionate about. I started reading everything about marketplaces, including the Everything Store, which is the Amazon early book that really inspired a lot of what you see in them from my standpoint. And so, you know, as a frustrated builder with a hammer looking for a nail, I was looking for my marketplace to be built and Obamacare was starting to emerge back in 2014. And it looks such a natural, natural place for me to try something. Right. So, it's like huge variation of cost with no difference in quality. It's like retail 25 years ago. Right. I mean it's just amazing opportunity. And cost and quality variation in healthcare is the biggest disparity in everything else in the world. I mean, US healthcare is the most, the biggest market with variation that you can ever imagine. So, I thought it's a great opportunity. And I didn't know anything about health care back then. I don't think I know too much today. But I think I know a little bit more. And I feel very lucky to stumble upon this amazing opportunity in an industry and people. And it's been fun. I think it's fascinating and it's inspiring for me to hear about the shift in you. And sort of self responsibility that you took over your own contentedness, happiness and satisfaction and fulfillment, right? I mean, I believe that they've done multiple studies on happiness, and satisfaction levels of people. And multiple levels of satisfaction and fulfillment of people. And they found that there is the, as you approach, I believe, 80 or $90,000 a year salary, it's actually like a logarithmic curve. Your happiness shoots up as you are able to feed your family and pay your rent. But then as you reach that 80, 90, 100,000, it starts leveling out. And then the extra money doesn't actually make a difference in fulfillment. And that's where you go and you find your passion. And I just love that. Oron, thank you so much for being on the show. Thank you for being so generous with your time. This was inspiring for me and it's inspiring me and hopefully my friends as well who are listening to this to go and tackle these big, big problems that are both very economical for a startup, but also just a huge impact on people's lives. But before we go, I have to ask you the most important question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. And the hardest question. Yeah. Well, you know, the first one is easy. I think I'm pretty driven. You just described why. And I think it's a really good description. I'm really not motivated by money. I'm motivated by impact. I think I rediscovered myself. I'm 38 now. So, I rediscover myself in the age of 30. The second one is fortunately or unfortunately, I'm pretty optimistic. So, I need to try and see the horizon, the full picture and what's going to happen and try to believe in this and try to be part of that. I am truly optimistic the US healthcare system is going to change because if it's not going to change, we're going to have a 20% GDP problem, kind of problem emerging in the next couple of years. It's ridiculous, right? So, something need to change. So, hopefully to be in the right set of a change. The third one is pretty tactical, I think. I think I'm pretty decisive. So, I mean, there is an unlimited number of literature, pages, articles, people you can speak with in this industry. And it's not never going to be enough. And I think just me coming from a place of zero knowledge, don't know what I don't know. In the long term my co-founders and we try to make a difference in this industry, decisiveness is a really important feature. And I think those three maybe describe me at least in 2020, or in the past seven years, they describe me pretty well. I love it. Oron, thank you very much. Toda raba. Enjoy the rest of your time in Wyoming. Thank you for making an impact in a lot of people's lives. And stay safe and stay healthy. You too, Michael. Thanks man.
