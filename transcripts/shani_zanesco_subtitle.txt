1 Shani Zanescu, thank you so much for being on my show. How are you? Good, thank you for having me. With the huge list of remarkable people, I'll try to reach up the bar, yeah. I'll try, I'll try. I am extremely excited for this conversation. Shani, besides the fact that you're the founder of Isratech Ventures, which we'll of course, dive into, I think talking about your journey is extremely relevant and interesting. Because like you mentioned right before we started talking, your entrance to the tech world as an Israeli is not that perhaps, traditional startup nation, the classic story of 8200, elite unit, whatever, and then going into the tech. You had a multitude of really fascinating positions with embassies, with diplomats. So, Shani, who are you? And then later on, we'll dive into what Isratech Ventures is about. Yeah. Well, I always like to start my story in a town called Fort Worth, Texas. Yeah. A Christian university. Yeah. But beforehand, I guess it all begins with a dramatic day that my parents told me the worst thing that you can tell to a 15 year old living in Israel, surrounded with friends, I grew up in Misgav, which is like a kibbutz, like it's really the best place to live. Where we have one of the best robotics team in Israel. Yes, that's true. So, it was very dramatic. I thought it was the end of the world for a teenager to say, "Hey, we're moving to Fort Worth, Texas." I had no idea what this place was. And then indeed one thing led to another. And I was bumped to class. So, I went straight into my senior year and then started applying to colleges because this is what you do in the US, right? And I didn't really know English. At the beginning I didn't want to speak with everyone because I was angry, right? Yeah. But then I didn't have a choice. And the first happy thing was that I realized that I can get my license, driving license before everyone else. So, it was the first good sign. And then one thing led to another. And I got into Texas Christian University, which is a private university. And it was I mean, it was such a different experience than all of my other friends. And I mean, it was a great experience. Some of my best friends for life, obviously, were my roommates and yada yada. And then, I had a choice, about what should I do. Because my parents went back to Israel. We were there on a relocation. So, at the age of the 17, I did my first intuitive decision. I didn't know that it's called intuition back then. And it was to decide to stay by myself in Fort Worth, Texas, to complete my degree. Because all of my family went back to Israel. And I'm glad I did that. I decided to also, another intuitive decision was, to come back to Israel and still do my military service even though I was 21, which is old for military here. So, you finished your degree in the US and then you came and you essentially volunteered or did your military service back in Israel? I did my regular military service. The only thing was my mind was wired like when you're about to graduate from college, they're like, you can do whatever you want. And I started sending my CV to places in the military, which no one does in Israel. Like I started it. And then I ended up in the foreign affairs unit. And then I decided that I want to be an ambassador and I want to connect people to Israel, and I want to do all these things and all that jazz. What was it about the experience in the foreign affairs unit that made you say, I want to be an ambassador and I want to be a diplomat for now? I think that it was something that still accompanies me until this very day, and that is that, it just feels like I'm a part of something bigger. And I know, I bet a lot of people say it to you, but this is for me the one of the most strongest motives for me to do things. Like I like to be a part of something and over there it was a daily thing that you're doing small stuff, but you know the repercussions of that. So, it's very thrilling to me. And then, I also recognize that it's a passion of mine to connect people to Israel in like a non cynical way. Because everyone around me was cynical about it. But it's like something I recognize there. So, I did the obvious thing that people in the foreign affairs unit do after they're done. And I moved again to the Netherlands, to The Hague, and I was assistant defense attaché there. So, I did what I wanted to do. It was a great experience, but it was too cold so I decided to come back. But honestly, it was lonely, too. It's lonely, to be honest. And I also realized that I don't want to be an ambassador. I'm guessing it's not just the location that is perhaps less lively than the city of Tel Aviv, which is one of the liveliest place in the world. But it's also the fact that you're alone there, right? I mean, you're living straight out of the army. A lot of people go to university together or move to Tel Aviv together. And if you're going to a different place, yeah, I completely understand. Yeah. And everyone at the embassy were couples and families. And it's just like you get the point of it. And I was already very independent, so I kind of like experienced. I traveled a lot around Europe, I lived in the States. So, at the very young age, I was already just taking the boxes on a lot of things that I wanted to do. Right. So, I moved back to Israel. And I didn't know what I was going to do so, I signed up for a masters degree. Right, this is what we do. And then I started looking for a job and it was like a culture shock. It was interesting because I was coming back to my own country, but I was still experiencing all the culture shocks that I've heard that other people felt. Like I felt like an ulla, almost. Interesting. Yeah. Wow. Even though you served in the IDF, even though you grew up in a kibbutz, you felt like an ulla. Kind of, yeah. Because you need to rebuild your life again. And I had friends and I'm very good at keeping touch with people, but there are a lot of struggles. And you do have more comfortable lives if you live in Europe or in the US, I'm sure you're aware. And you need to give up all the comfort things that are very obvious when you live abroad and not in Israel. So, it's even in the small things and in your day to day stuff. And also, I get back and I didn't know what I was doing with my life. And after the whole bam, bam, I'm doing this and doing that, and you're like, "Why everyone is saying to me I'm overqualified for jobs?" "What does that even mean?" You start realizing that you need to do some work on yourself. And that was for me the point. So, talk to me a little bit about the transition from diplomacy and foreign affairs to Israeli tech. Because that sounds like a little odd transition. Especially because it sounds like there was a point where you did a little bit abruptly. Yeah. Well, so when I got back, I started working at the British Council. And I started as a project manager and I moved up to be the head of the department. And in this organization, they do collaborations with the UK on various of sectors. And one of the sectors is research and science and innovation. I think that was for me, like the gling gling gling, when I realized that I'm a nerd. Like, wow, science is amazing. Technology is like mind blowing. There are people here who are doing amazing stuff. And this whole idea of continuing to promote Israel through tech is there. So, after three years there, I also managed an innovation center. And I wasn't there for a very long time. But I think there, it was the first time in my life that I worked with entrepreneurs. And you speak to a lot of entrepreneurs, I'm assuming, so you know that spark in their eye and that passion, it's something that is completely like it sucks you in, you want to be around with people and there's no way back. So, from working with ministers and CEOs and high levels, which was I still do that, it's great, but it didn't feel the same. So, I left and like every good story, a friend of mine gave me a kick in the butt to come to one of the delegation of investors that wanted to be introduced to some startups, and it started from there. And it just happened naturally. I know it's not a good recipe or something that people might be able to follow, but for me, the transition wasn't a one day that I decided that I'm going to do it. It wasn't a role. It was a very gradual process. And from meeting all the delegations that come to Israel and are craving meeting the best people, the best technologies, want to hear more about it, I also started doing consulting to innovation programs and accelerators and hubs, and all these angel investors wanted me to work with them. And then it really led me to work with one specific investor that I'm working with also today that is again doing something huge, that is much bigger than me. So, the transition was very gradual. It wasn't sudden. You mentioned clearly and you alluded a few times to this idea that helping Israel through tech and innovation, because you're coming from the foreign affairs segment. And I'd love to dive into this a little bit, because I think it's really interesting. A lot of people are talking about Israel as a startup nation and innovation through necessity, no place for small dreams, right? And I'm curious about the role on the diplomatic side and the foreign affairs side on Israel being a startup nation. So, what is the importance of that? And give me a little bit of insight into the back seat of the diplomacy scene. Wow. So, I've seen it in all sorts of angles. So, I first saw it from the defense angle, okay? And there it's like it sounds weird, but it's very safe. Israel is like the go to place for defense technologies, [--]. Everyone wants to work with Israel, even if they're not admitting it. Okay? And it was very interesting to me because I saw how people, colleagues from all around the world are craving so much to work with Israel, but they're afraid to do so. And I think, coming from the startups and technologies, it's much more legitimate thing because people are just looking for solutions for XYZ, and you know that they find it here. And I think what's interesting for me, now and always, was to be in this intersection of being the one who's either initiating or supporting or accompanying the collaborations and bringing in government. Because you need everything. So, the government role, the private money, which is extremely important, you can't really do anything, you can have a lot of plans but you need that private money, and all the other players. So, the private sector, the public sector, some NGOs even. And I think for me, I was always in this intersection. And when I decided to go ahead on my own freelance way with Isratech Venture, it was really from the purpose of shining this intersection and making it more accessible to people. With the emphasis of bringing investments to all these amazing startups. And for me that is the best service that I can do for my country, to bring in that foreign money. So, is that really what the goal of Isratech is, to bring in partners across the seas from different cultures and different backgrounds to support Israeli tech innovation? Yeah. So, along the years, I really realized that I accumulated a network of, I truly mean it, remarkable people from all around the world. And in conversations, we always had this like, okay, so how do we begin; how do we start this collaboration; and I know this investor, I know this minister, like it was so disorganize to me. And I knew that I could just, if I have my own platform, I'm like, I don't owe anything to anyone, really, I can just do the great connections that I want to do. So, to be honest, it's just a platform for me to play around and do whatever I love, which is to connect all these people who are very influential from all around the world, and in the process support startups that I truly admire and truly love and want an excuse to work with them to invest. Yeah. That sounds so so cool. So, give me a little bit of background about your experience right now with this. So, what part of this really makes you really passionate about this in the day to day? Is it meeting the startups? Is it the meeting the people outside of Israel and connecting, seeing the connections unfold? Because I'm guessing that a lot of the times the connections, while they're being made through Isratech Ventures, they expand much further than that as they go on these longer term collaborations. So, which part of it do you get really excited about? So, pre covid-19, we have two parts of the [--]. So, covid-19 I really enjoyed, I had these marathon days of meeting 10 startups a day like boom boom boom, And sometimes it was very boring and sometimes exciting, I met so many people. It really like it's a certain energy that is can be really exhausting but can really nurture you as well, depends on who you are meeting. And I was working in a very very quick pace. Nowadays, and I had all these incoming delegations, and come right here and come right there, it was a different vibe. And I just enjoyed the whole complex of that. Nowadays, I think what I enjoy most is to really work with the companies, with the startups. So, I am on some boards and working with portfolio companies of the investor I'm working with. And it's really interesting to me to really dive in to the company. And, half of the time I'm only listening because I'm trying to understand how I can help them and not to jump and be like, hey, I connect you to this and this. It's like something that in Israel we love to do, to really soak in where they are, what they need and try to help them, again, by connecting them to both my network and anything else that they need. So, I think for me, it's really something what I enjoy most now. And it's also a time when you really you kind of deepening every aspect of your life. So, I think for me also at work and you're just everything is more calm. So, I'm trying to enjoy it because the craziness will return, right? 100%. Shani, 20 minutes ago by very very fast. And I think it's wonderful to hear about somebody's journey coming from outside of the tech world and finding passion within it and finding the right foothold and making a really positive impact, not just on entrepreneurs, but also on the state of Israel as a whole. So, thank you for that. But before we leave, I have to ask you for the most important question, three words that you would use to describe yourself. Wow. Last week, I learned a new word from a friend that I think really describes me and probably people already saw it because you read people's energy, you can't really define them in words, right? So, the word was vivacious. Okay. I didn't know this word. You're learning something new. And I think the second word would be, a creator. Okay. And I think the last and most important word would be, heart. Wholehearted, heart led, I think it's what describes me the best. I love it. Shani, toda raba. Thank you very very much. Best of luck with Isratech Ventures and all the wonderful work that you're doing. And I'm very excited to share this with the world. Thank you. Thank you so much for having me. Bye Bye. Bye.
