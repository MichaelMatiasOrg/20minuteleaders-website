1 Daniel, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Thank you for having me. It's o good to have you. Where are you calling from right now? Tel Aviv. Tel Aviv. And how is everything with the quarantine and with covid-19? It's seems reasonable now actually. We're starting to see the end and people and more going outside. And yeah, I'm fairly optimistic around that at the moment. Fantastic. So you know this interview is going to be published in a few weeks. So, I'm always curious to see how the state of during the interview time and then, what actually happens once its published. So, let's hope that everything is open by then and everything's wonderful. Daniel, you're working on one of the coolest companies that I know and that's because I'm a fitness and health sort of fanatic myself. I used to be so passionate about what I put in my body and how I treat myself. And now with the quarantine, I've been indulging in a little bit more pizza than I should. All of us. All of us. Daniel, you know, before we get into Lumen, give me a brief rundown on everything done up to now because you're a seasoned entrepreneur you've had a lot of experience before coming to Lumen. And then let's dive in to this incredible device that you've created. Okay. Okay, so I'll try to be brief around that. So, I've been entrepreneur for the past 16 years. So, Lumen is my, our third company, I'll talk about my founders in a second, but kind of my professional life this is almost all I did. Before that, boy scouts, a kid in the boy scouts, love people interaction and so forth. And then the navy. As a navy officer. Wow. So that's, I think kind of gave me a certain skill set to let's say work pretty well with people. Yeah. But nothing professional really to dive into and I think I became a good learner around that - sure, sure - those periods of time But, that's it. So, my journey began very naively. In 2005, I sat next to the first day of school in university, in IDC in Herzliya. I sat next to my founder today and my partner for a lot of time. We sat next to each other. His name is Dror. And very naively we started talking about doing something on the internet. And we built something. We built a product. We found our missing link, the technical guy who was was our CTO in all companies, and stills is. Avi. And we build kind of a search engine to... A very visual one. That helps people kind of browse through the top websites in every category. That was the first initiative. We've made every mistake possible in the book. We built a product, never launched it for two and a half years. Always tweaking it and improving it. No one ever experienced that. And then we launched it to TechCruch 50 and at the time we launched it, we decided that no one will actually use that engine. There was a better one out there and we killed it and immediately got start pitching something else basically. The second day of the conference, we started pitching something completely different. And that thing was a tool for websites to and publishers to integrate apps into services into their platforms. And that was our second company basically. That was Wibiya. And Wibiya was kind of a fairytale story. Two and a half years, raised about $2.5 million, then actually sold it to another company, another Israeli company called Conduit, Yup and stayed there for two and a half years. And then, the three of us left and started basically three months later, started working on Lumen. So, Daniel you actually went with your two co-founders throughout this whole entrepreneurial journey for 15 years which is also it's not that common. So, I actually saw that from the top reasons why companies fail, one of the top reasons is that founders have a dispute at some point and they part ways. But you have an experience here - Do you think that you sort of, the time that you were all in the army not necessarily together but you all went through this camaraderie experience, and you learn what it takes to work with people even if you don’t necessarily see eye to eye on everything? I'm not sure it's the army. I think it's the type of person that you work with and not necessarily the army. Yes, the army gets, maybe gives you some skills around that. But you can take it from a lot of places and it's mainly the people you choose to work. And to be honest it's also, it's a process. Right? Oh yeah. We all of us had a lot of ego on the table when we starting working together and everything was much much harder. And yes, we're fortunate to continue together. But for Lumen, what we did was even more, was more dangerous. It's basically, Lumen was incubated in my house. So my spouse Michal, and her twin sister Merav, they basically their babies. So, they are the science, nutrition, the physiology. Everything smart behind what we do. I fell in love with the concept. The concept of measuring and understanding something that really happens in my body that potentially will have an impact on on the way I train, on the food I eat, and on my health in the future. And I was fascinated by that. And I am fortunate to have a very good teacher. Every evening on the couch, explaining to me the science of how physiology works and everything. And somehow, I don’t know how I got my co-founders Dror and Avi to join into this journey. I know how I sold them a very big lie in a sense, I told them, "Listen, it's going to be a breeze. It's hardware. But we get the sensors. We get design. We do a kick starter. After a year, we have a product out there" That was 2014 and it only took us six years to get the product out eventually. But we did. I love it. I love that story. So, where is Lumen right now? So, May 2020, what's happening with Lumen? Lumen started in 2014, but actually in a way Lumen is really starting now. We launched a product to our backers who backed us on Indiegogo. 10,000 of them. In 2018. Yeah, 10,000 of them. And kind of middle late 2018. We delivered the product, it took us a lot of time but we delivered the product in January. Most of the products got to customers in January and now we're actually feeding from their feedback and continuously improving the product. And very soon, in about two weeks’ time, we're going to publicly launch what we're doing after we get some feedback and we got more inventory to sell. So yeah. Lumen is, it's the middle of the journey but for the people outside of the company, in a way, it's just a start. Just the beginning. Oh, I'm sure. So, first of all Indiegogo. I don't get to meet many people that have launched such successful campaigns on Indiegogo. I mean, 10,000 units sold. That's a lot of confidence. And a product that hasn’t been launched yet. What was that experience like? Going on crowdfunding and trying to get the public to really buy into this idea of this hardware that's gonna help you gain control over what you put into your body. Yeah. It was fascinating because, you know we’ve been pitching this concept and we're actually been testing it with prototypes since 2017. But still, for someone to take money out of the pocket and pay for something, for a device and really engage with it that was, you really need to understand how you're going to sell this and why would people buy it. And we really didn’t want this to be a concept of this is a cool gadget that you just buy or another gadget. We wanted this to be tied into something people care about. And nutrition is something people are deeply passionate about. Oh totally There is a community of people who are obsessed about it for different reasons. Working out. Losing weight. And so we took a shot at this at basically not positioning this as a device that can do thousands of things but actually more capturing and showing you, if Lumen is in your hands, how can you use it? What's the value for you? And I think, as opposed to many other campaigns that are basically showcasing technology, we were a lot more focused on the experience. And we kind of knew that the experience we were offering is something that people will actually be using and succeeding with. So, that's I think the theme to that is pretty solid start to work on a campaign with. To be honest, I didn’t do a lot in the campaign It's also finding the people who are talented around that. And my partner Dror has led this concept almost completely alone with a very selected few. And he did a phenomenal job. Definitely. Definitely. So, give in a few sentences, what am I experiencing when I hold Lumen in my hands and trust me I'm gonna be holding Lumen in my hands sooner or later. Okay. So, yes. This is Lumen basically. It's a very small device that you can carry with you or just put on your stand. And you breath to this in the morning. It's not a normal breath you inhale air through it. And everything is guided through an app. You hold the air in your lungs for ten seconds and you exhale. And what Lumen does is basically sampling the CO2 content of your breath. And through that, it basically reflects to you whether you're currently using fats or carbs for fuel in real time. And it changes. Right. Our body can use fats and carbs. And those are two different fuels for probably different goals in a sense. But, what you want to be doing if you're waking up in the morning on a fasted state, you want your body to be using fats. because night time is the time for the body to transition to fat burn in a sense. So that's a first moment in the day that you can get a sense of control of really what's happening. What happened yesterday? Have you been eating too much? You ate too late. You drank alcohol in the evening. Stress. Sleep deprivation. All of those are preventing you basically from getting into fat burn in the morning. But then, what do I do with this information? So, let's say I get this information. Okay. Yeah, fine. So, I'm burning carbs. I'm not burning fat. What do I do now? So, what Lumen provides you with is kind of actionable insights on what you should be doing. So you get a nutrition plan for today, what you should be eating. You should follow that. It's insightful around workouts and it's insightful around how much carbs, proteins, and fats you should have. And it actually, gradually becomes more and more actionable the way we designed the product. And once you follow that, you measure again the next morning and you start seeing the change. So, it will ... you in a way. There is a learning experience in that journey of self-exploration and it teaches you what works for you which not necessarily will be the thing that will work for someone else. So, and how quickly will I see this change? And how quickly will I see the progress that I'm making towards my, let's say my goal is to burn more fat, so, how quickly will I notice this change? It really depends on you. In a sense people who are insulin resistance, or having sort of resistance, who are pre-diabetic will probably take a bit longer to see the impact. But generally, healthy people it's a matter of days of following a nutrition plan and seeing that. And it's an interesting feedback because you can mess it up very easily. Okay. One night of playing poker, eating pizza with friends, you wake up on a carb burn very easily. Which is okay, right? It's part of life. But you wanna have the tool that kind of guides you or the compass that gives you direction when you're good, when the things you did are impactful, or when it's not And you can get back on track with. Definitely. So, two questions here. Because changing human behavior, and changing consumer behavior is difficult. It's almost impossible. I had the pleasure of working with Dan Ariely at Irrational Labs a few years ago, and our research and our work was centered around, how can we think of consumer behavior on technological products and guide for different behaviors based on what we're doing? And part of Dan's premise is that you know, we are irrational beings. It's very hard for us to change our behavior. But it's much easier for us to change our environment which will force us to change out behavior. So how do you perceive users adhering to this nutrition plan and changing their behavior as a result of seeing these results on an app? Is that something that you really think is gonna happen? Or have you been seeing that it's happening? We're already seeing it's happening. But it's a process of designing. So the device is really only the first phase. Right? The experience that the user go through, in terms of insights, and what should he do about it as you said rightfully, it's happening in the app, right? That journey is really happening through content in the app. Sure. I can give you an example exactly pointing to the point that you're raising. When we launched this, or gave it to beta users in early batches, we told them, "You can measure in the morning and before lunch and after lunch. Before workout. After workout." We gave them tons of opportunities to measure and understand stuff. And it was a bit overwhelming to them. And then what we did is, What is the ritual? The one ritual we need to nurture that will become maybe the default. Basically, we have a potential to capture a moment of the users’ day. When is that going to be? And how much value we can focus on that moment? And that moment is morning time. We find that morning time at fasting, there is something, there is a, it's a mindful moment that you can take for yourself and people can get used to it. Basically, like brushing their teeth, right? Behavioral change is hard but people are relatively okay with brushing their teeth. I hope. And so, I think wellness rituals, have a potential to make an impact and to become habits if there is a feedback loop, right? It's easier to some extent if you can measure something that gives you a reflection of what's happening and where you're heading. Oh no totally. And I think that goes back to a lot of research by ... and habit formation and atomic habits that I read recently about how do you do these incremental steps. And one of the most important parts of habit formation really is this idea that you have this quick feedback loop. And you can see this very incremental small progress every day because a lot of people who are, let's say, are trying to lose weight, which I guess is very common use case for people who want to use Lumen, If they don't see their weight drop within a a day or two, it becomes very hard to continue this ritual. But if you can guide them on a daily basis, of okay, you've now transitioned a little bit more towards the fat burning zone that makes sense as something that could be very beneficial. Yeah, that's true. And I can say that in the past six years, we struggled a lot about weight loss in general. Right? Because what happens when weight loss when you succeed? Let's say it works and you lose a couple of pounds, and so why will you use Lumen in a sense? And what's the value of that ritual? So, what we focus on is really about metabolic flexibility and metabolic health. And this is a constant evolution of your body. Our metabolism changes on a daily basis, but also really like being in shape and out of shape, right? If you run every day, you're in shape. If you stop running for a week, you're a bit out of shape, you're not completely out of shape, but you're trailing into this. The same happens with our metabolic flexibility or metabolic health. Our ability to use carbs or fats as fuel, as they're available or not available. Fats from our own stores. And that is something that never dies. In a way, that's something that you can constantly improve. And the nutrition journey people take upon themselves is one that is dynamically changing. They start to workout. Their metabolism changes. They fly. Now, no one flies. But they fly and they get jetlagged, right? So, they go on a vacation. So, in a sense that's how we see the future. Even if people come to lose weight. What we've get them hooked on eventually is metabolic health. Which is something sustainable. I love it. Okay. So, the second it comes on Amazon or wherever you're selling it, please let me know so I can be one of the first people to purchase it. I will. It sounds incredible. And as a person who, I'm very dedicated to my health and working out and doing a lot of these a lot of these research on my own. It's definitely something that we need. And it's something that I would find so useful because that unknown and that feeling of control that you don’t really feel like you have over your body throughout your life. I think that’s something that’s really really wonderful. Daniel, before we go, and I can’t believe 20 minutes are almost over because I have so many questions, I want to ask you the most important question. Three words that you would best describe yourself or that one of your co-founders would describe you at. So, I'll be honest. I thought about it because that's a tough question. I think it's a good one though. It's the hardest question. It's the hardest question. So, I think optimistic would be one. I'm definitely optimistic in everything I do. 15 years as an entrepreneur Daniel. Come on. You have to be optimistic. Yeah. You have to be optimistic. And in doing some stuff that are really off the trend. You know, wellness is a trend, but hardware, no one will invest in hardware especially the early stages. It's really hard to build a company that is doing consumer behavioral changes. ... hardware and so forth. So, optimistic is one. I'm a learner. I love it. I look at every experience I'm going through as a learning phase. If it's the dynamics with the team, or if it's understanding CO2 and CO2 sensors and so forth. And the last one is a leader, but it's an aspiration. So, I aspire to be a good leader but not good leader for the community. Good leader for my team in a sense. So, this is my focus and I hope I'm on a trajectory to do a good job there. Daniel, toda raba. Thank you so much. And more success to everything. It sounds amazing. Thank you. Sure is.
