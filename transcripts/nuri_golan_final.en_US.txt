1 In Hebrew you say, "meharagelayim" like by your feet. And you have to experience it yourself. You have to push yourself to your limits and understand that, like, there's more that you can do. You don't have to succumb to the stress, pressure or whatever is in front of you at the moment. Nuri Golan, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you today? I'm good. How are you? I'm doing great. I'm very jealous of you. You get to meet Shuly and Gil on an ongoing basis. And I miss them so much ever since I came back to Israel for the covid times. So, please send them my love and my regards. But enough about them. Nuri, such a fascinating journey that you've taken. And perhaps one of the most fascinating pieces of it is right in the beginning as a captain in the Israeli Navy Seals, turning into running R&D for that same unit. And then the boring stuff, selling a company and creating another startup, sitting on advisory boards. But that's the boring stuff. Let's go back to the beginning. Nuri, how do you get to be a combat officer in the Navy Seals? Lots of reasons for wanting to do that, but most importantly, you know, I grew up in a very zionist family. A lot of my uncles and my dad all served in the Israeli military. So, when I was a teenager, I started to think about it and then I actually was within Israel during the second Lebanon war in 2006. And it was a really interesting experience being there. I think I was 19 at the time. And everyone your age is kind of out at war. And so, being there and having a good time in Tel Aviv, but not seeing anybody your age really has an impact on you. And someone who always kind of thought about wanting to serve and do something a little bit bigger than me, that was the kind of the straw that broke the camel's back and I decided I wanted to join the Israeli military. So, I finished my degree. So, I was studying at George Washington University at the time, aerospace engineering. So, I spent another two years completing my degree. And then in 2008, I got on a plane with my cousin and the two of us made Aliyah and joined. And then I thought I was only going to go for two years and then come back to the US. And you ended up at nine. Yeah. I got accepted to the Navy SEAL entry exam. And on my way there somebody told me, "Do you know that this is at least five years service." And I said, "I didn't know that, but okay." And once I passed and they admitted me and invited me to start training, I just couldn't give up the opportunity. Nuri, I have to say that, you know, I'm sure that a lot of my friends in Israel who are going to be listening to this are already getting frustrated because, you know, it's known how insanely difficult it is to get accepted to the Navy SEALs. You know, the gibush is one of the most notorious difficult experiences that any young 18 or 17 year-olds can go through and getting accepted there is remarkable. And I'm sure that it's quite a big shock also coming from university, studying aerospace engineering and landing all of a sudden in this five, six year program where you're literally, you know, drinking seawater and eating sand. Talk to me a little bit about this experience of going from George Washington University straight into the Navy SEALs. Well, it's definitely a shock. There were many moments where I stood there. I think one of the, during the five day entry exam, the gibush, at one point, it was like there was a lightning storm out and they were making us running out of the water. And I was holding this giant, like metal anchor. And they told me to go throw it in the water so we could go like, run around it in circles. And I'm like looking up at the sky, thinking I'm about to get hit by lightning carrying this giant thing. And I'm like, what the hell am I doing here? How did I get here? But, you know, at the time, again, I was 21 at the time I was locked in, focused. This is what I wanted to do. And so, you know, that kind of takes over any of the critical thinking parts of your brain and you just kind of run with it. It's definitely a challenge for me at least. Like some of the most challenging parts weren't necessarily the physical pieces but dealing with, you know, having officers and commanders who were younger than me. Who didn't really have a ton of life experience, you know, it was really funny. Like, I had a degree, again, I wasn't exactly like the most mature and sophisticated person in the world, but I had an engineering degree and people are looking at me like I'm only going to start my college in like five or six years after I finished the US military, go travel for two years, take a year off. So, that for me, was one of the most difficult parts. So, just for context, I want to move forward on your journey just so we can get the context as to the type of person you are. But then I really want to circle back and go back to these extraordinary lessons that one can learn in the combat unit. Because the truth be told, most of Israelis in the tech scene, especially those that are in Silicon Valley, they're not coming from these elite combat unit. So, a lot of them are coming from, you know, 8200, 81, all those elite technological units. And so, I'm extremely excited to hear your perspective on the different leadership lessons. But walk me through some of the different experiences you've had, like with EXO that was acquired by Lear, and then sitting on advisory boards in your most recent startup. Are you asking about those experiences specifically, or? Yeah. Give me the rundown of what happened since you left, just so we can get the context. So, I finished my service. And I always, like startup world and entrepreneurship was something that was always interesting to me. And I ended up doing my MBA at the Technion which had a startup in innovation program, specifically. Casual. And so, that kind of is where everything started. They basically tell you, like, you should start a company and use this as an incubator for, you know, to build your idea. And so, I was lucky enough to meet a couple of partners. One of which was the guy who led the GPS squadron in the US Air Force. So, he had some ideas about how to improve the accuracy of GPS. Obviously, that was like, okay, this can be a very big deal. And so, we started a company around it. And yeah, like the lessons in the training that you get in the military, in my opinion, are some of the best that an entrepreneur can get. Like, you're right, when I go around in Silicon Valley, pitching a VC, they ask me, "Were you in 8200? Were you in 81?" you know, they already know those buzzwords. And I was like, "Oh no, I was in 13." They were like, "What is that?" I'm like, the opposite end of the spectrum. But I think that, you know, like the training that you do you're used to working under serious time constraints, never knowing what the next minute is going to be, let alone the next week or month. You know, intense conditions, everything is up and down and you have to learn to keep yourself kind of really levelheaded. And so, I think, like the best entrepreneur lessons I ever learned were in the training that I got in the military. And I think that helped me, you know, through EXO where we are trying to sell deep tech company or the technology product to a lot of, to like the automotive industry, which was at the time, you know, it's still a very difficult industry to sell into especially for startups. You have a lot of highs and lows and being able to manage that is one of the most critical parts of running an early stage startup. Right. So, you've done that, you've done it once, you're doing it again now, at Sosivio. What is Sosivio? So, Sosivio is a autonomous cloud native platform. So, it helps you manage your, it's like a next generation of observability tool for managing your online and cloud native services. And so we help any company of any size, generally some of the larger companies that are moving into the cloud more and more so, keep their applications running and keeping their environments optimized. So, it sounds like it's definitely sounds like something that's necessary to do. But, what is the problem? Because, you know, from most people's perspective, we look at all the big tech companies that we have today, obviously, they're running in the cloud and obviously every startup is starting out in the cloud. I think people will quickly forget that the majority of the world is not in the cloud. I don't know exactly what percentage, maybe you can enlighten me, but I still believe that a lot of the big core enterprises that we've seen, that we've rolled in from the 20th century have yet to make that transition. Am I right? Well, yeah. I mean, cloud is just also one of those terms that you don't know exactly what you mean. Like cloud, a lot of people today, they think that means you're running on AWS or Google or Azure. But really like anything that where you're running an application, not on your own computer is cloud technically. Right? Like you're running something somewhere else. And to do that, you have to use a ton of different software and services and tools to help keep it running smoothly. And so, observability is one piece of that world which is just helping keep your services up and running. Like everyone's had the experience where they are using an application, it could be a banking app on your phone and it just crashes on you. Like, why did that happen, why does it happen only once out of 100 times. Well, there could be a number of circumstances in how the environment is operating, where in that one moment when enough people are using it, the system crashes. And so, what we do is we are able to figure out much earlier before those failures materialize, like what's going on and whether or not something's going to happen. So, we predicted ahead of time and help you make sure it doesn't affect your customers experience. Wow. And where are you at with that journey right now? So, I know that your a part of Upwest Labs, a phenomenal, phenomenal group. But what's been the journey like for Sosivio? Yeah, I mean, the company was started earlier this year. Me and one of my co-founders from EXO, and then Adam, Avi, and Liran are the other co-founders, started it up. We raised a little bit of money. We're raising money again right now, which is always a fun process and starting to build it out. We have a core product that's being released. And we're working with a number of partners already. So, it's very exciting time. And what's been the most biggest learning experience or the learning curve that you had to adapt to as you are transitioning? Because on one, it is very different from everything else you've done, right? I understand coming from a military background when we still have to talk about the leadership experience that you have gained there, but I understand the technical background you've gained there. The GPS deep technology military application makes a lot of sense. And now you're moving on to helping big enterprises make a transition towards the cloud world with predictive analysis on when things might go wrong. It doesn't connect in my mind. Help me work this out. I mean, you don't always have to be the industry expert yourself to run a successful business or startup. I think that, you know, there's a lot of other factors you can talk about, like leadership, right? Like having someone who can just steer the ship in the right way, know how to build the company in the right way, and bring in the right people and the right experience, the right talent. That's critically important. And so, this is a brand new space for me, which is a challenge, and it's actually a challenge that I embrace it. You know, I was excited about trying something new and not just staying in the same field for the rest of my life. For me, like what I want to do is I want to continuously build companies and learn of it. But one of the cool things about doing this is that you get to learn a whole new space and you get to learn a whole new world of technology, a whole new world of people. And that to me is exciting. So, it's not that there's a direct connection between GPS and cloud services, it's more that the recipe for building a good startup is pretty much the same no matter what industry you're in. And it sounds to me like the key ingredient all the way from studying aerospace in George Washington to go into the Navy SEALs to running R&D in the Navy SEALs to selling a GPS company to now doing this as curiosity. I mean, it sounds like you're just passionate about whatever you're doing. You are embracing that challenge. You mentioned before when you were just doing that gibush, that you're sort of trained your mind to stop that critical thinking and to embrace the challenge and to run headfirst. And it sounds like there's a lot of parallelism to what you experienced going into perhaps one of the most difficult units of the IDF and one of the most prestigious units to running a startup. Am I right? Yeah. I mean, there's I'm a pretty analytical person. I like to sit down and think through problems. But there comes a time where you need to just run through a wall. And I think that's like one of the things that going through you know, the Israeli Navy SEALs really helps you like, you can think about every aspect of a problem and you can have a perfect strategy. Occasionally you're just going to come up against an obstacle and you need to get through it in whatever way possible. And I think that's a piece that you know, it's not something you can teach someone or tell someone. They can only learn it on their own. Like in Hebrew you say, "meharagelayim", like by your feet. You have to experience it yourself. You have to push yourself to your limits and understand that, like there's more that you can do,. You don't have to succumb to the stress, pressure or whatever's in front of you at the moment. Right. That makes a lot of sense. I'm thinking back to some experiences I had. I came from 8200. I wish I came from, like an experience like the Navy SEALs. Unfortunately, I probably couldn't get in even if I applied. But I remember that a lot of the times we had these struggles and we had to develop these technologies and we just didn't have the funds to do them. And we said, okay, well, we need this server, we need this technology and we need this type of person. And I would go to my commander and he would say, okay, no, no, and unfortunately no. So, good luck. You still have a week to get it done. Right? So, at that point, you're saying, okay, there's a wall and you just have to break it. What's leadership like in the Navy SEALs? What is it like being a combat leader? Well, you know, by the way, being a combat leader and being like a startup leader are two very different things. And I would actually argue that that being a startup leader or in the business world can actually be more difficult in a lot of ways. Being a combat leader, you know, like in the military, you have a rank, you have authority, like there is some things that are given from the beginning that make it a little bit easier. Where in the business world, especially in the Israeli business world, you have to earn your place because people will challenge you all the time. And so, you know, at the end of the day, like in the military, yes, you'll have the rank and you'll have the position, but you need to own up to it. Like you need to protect your people, you need to be, you know, lead by example, if I had to boil it all down to like one point, it would be lead by example. Like, if you preach to people certain things, you don't hold yourself to the same standards, you'll be toast in no time because the people won't respect you. So, for me, that was like the guiding light always was. Whatever I asked my teams to do or my people to do, I better make sure that I hold myself to that exact same standard. And if you do, there's really never going to be complaints from the people below you. Because if you're doing it, then why shouldn't they. Right? If you're the higher rank, if you're the person who should have the better benefits, better things, like they have no reason to complain. Right. And I think one of the very special things also about these different amazing units in the IDF is that a lot of the times the commanders are the ones who are doing the heavy lifting early on. And especially, I know in my unit and I'm sure also in the Navy SEALs that the people that are promoted, that are commanding and are leading the teams are people that were, perhaps, the best soldiers and the best that both mentally and physically and emotionally. So, I'm definitely sure of that. What about the hand tackling? It's different type of challenge? You know, when you take a team that is tired, that is beaten down and now you have to take that metal bar and run into the sea and throw it. It's a very different task than guiding somebody to work late, to deploy a new version or fix a bug. It must be very different. Yeah. I mean, of course. Look, one of the good, we talk about the differences between business leadership and combat leadership, in the military unit, one of the advantages is that everybody has a very clear common mission. Which is another very important aspect of leadership. It's like a business unit. The business all the time about what's the business's mission statement and what are you about. And that is an attempt to solidify a group around a common cause. In the military, you have that built in. It's like, okay, we all know what we're here for. Especially in Israel, right? We're here to make sure that the country survives till next year. So, you know, it's about making everybody understand that that's what they're there for. The risk and the circumstances are obviously a lot more significant in a combat role. And so, you know, that helps in some ways too, because you become a lot closer to the people you're around. Like the brotherhood that you build in the fraternity of the teams that you work with. You know, even to this day, like, I obviously have a lot of good friends who weren't in the military, but friends who did serve, especially friends who served, you know, on the front line, it doesn't matter if they were special forces or not. There's a different kind of connection there. Again, that's no disrespect to anyone who didn't serve in those roles but, there's something there that you just can't recreate in the outside world. And even in the business world, it's very difficult to do that. 100%. My father was a pilot. I guess maybe 40 years ago in the Air Force. And there's not a week goes by where he doesn't mention an amazing friend that he had in the course, as if, as if they did a program together last week. And you can feel the bond that people are creating this lifelong partnership which it's just phenomenal. You had a short stint in venture capital. Something that not a lot of entrepreneurs get. And you are as young as you are, so, how was that? Was it fun? Was it enlightening? Did you benefit from that towards the next startup? Yeah, absolutely. It was, first of all, I think, as most of the venture capitalists usually come from an entrepreneurial role of some kind. I think it's incredibly important to have been on the other side, to see what the startup is like. You look at things a lot differently on that side than when you're on the entrepreneur side. You really like, you can see when a startup is maybe, you know, extending the truth a little bit or you know, things pop out at you that maybe they didn't before. I know I'm sure that these guys are having this problem and just by the way that they're speaking about it. So, it's invaluable experience. And then now back on the entrepreneur side, it's also very, very valuable because now, you know, when you go to pitch a VC you know what they're looking for, you know how busy they are, you know how like sometimes their attention spans can just be completely too short to really listen to you. So, you know, kind of where the heart is in and where to focus and it's certainly like incredible. I recommend that both sides do both roles. I think it will just be more productive for everyone. When I was doing that role at Lear, I felt from the entrepreneurs as well that they appreciated it as well, like having, especially in corporate venture capital. Because that's typically where you don't get, like, entrepreneurs, in a VC, again, like I was saying, usually they have some entrepreneurial experience. In a corporate venture capital world, not a lot of them have their own entrepreneurial experience. Because they're coming in from internally within the organization. Yes. I was kind of an out and I didn't stay. I was only a leader for two and a half years. But a lot of entrepreneurs who acquired either move, you know, they stay in the operations role of running that business or eventually they phase out. I grew the team within Lears of EXO and then eventually joined and helped launch the innovation organization and took over the venture capital part. But that was unique or definitely not the norm, I would say. Wow. Nuri, I want to thank you for being so generous with your time. Really, really wonderful. Before we go, I have to ask you for the most important question, which is three words that you would use to describe yourself. I'm particularly curious to hear what you have to say because of your extraordinary experience. I would say competitive is number one. Most people who, do have to explain them or just give you the words? If you can explain in a short sentences, I would love that. Most people who know me know that I'm extremely competitive about everything. And I joke including about who's more competitive, so. We're going to save this competition for the next episode because we have a competition going on here. Yeah. Disciplined, I would say number two. Where again, like, especially in entrepreneurship and obviously in the military, like being disciplined to yourself not just the outside world, like again, holding yourself to standards. Even when you tell people a certain thing like, Hey, you got to wake up at this time, you got to do this, this and this, a lot of times people aren't going to be there to see you or do it. And it's, you know, still important to hold yourself to the same standards because, it's not about actually doing those things. It's about the mentality of like, here's what we're going to do to it. And then three, I would say dedicated. Something else that drives me a lot, is when I get into something, I'm in it fully. So, that's I guess number three. Nuri, I knew you wouldn't disappoint those three words, Nuri, toda raba. Thank you very, very much. By the way, I think that those three words didn't come up in any of the other 250 episodes. Because this was a very special episode, it's one that's very dear to my heart because as I traverse along my journey, especially in Palo Alto, sometimes it's not easy to explain the experience of being in an organization like the IDF. And it's also a different, I think, from a lot of other military experiences as well. I have friends who served in different militaries. This innovation through necessity, this discipline, this being, you know, I remember when I enlisted and the first week that I enlisted, I came as 19 straight from Palo Alto. I was doing a year there with Professor Dan Ariely. I had a 19 year old girl who was screaming at me for forgetting to tie my shoes a certain way. And I remember that moment that it just dawned on me that, okay, this is a new reality and we're going to do some great things. And it was a fantastic experience. Nuri, Thank you very much. It was a pleasure. Thank you. Thanks for having me. Good luck.
