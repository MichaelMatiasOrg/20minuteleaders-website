Nadine, thank you so much for joining on 20 minute leaders and so nice of you to give me this time know you're a very, very busy, so thank you very, very happy to be with you wonderful so Nadine, you know, I've done quite a few of these so far with really extraordinary people that I'm inspired by each one I don't think they came across such a non-linear career path as yours from working with a leading politician in Mongolia to Shaman, which you're gonna explain to me what that is it to a classical music in New York and, you know, I can't even wrap my mind around can you please just give me a very somehow brief and short about what you've done and what motivates you in doing these things? yes so basically, there is a Danish philosopher, Kierkegaard, who said that when you look back at your life, everything makes a lot of sense the only thing is you have to live it forward, you know so at least for everything quite a paradox yeah so for everything I've lived till now, I can actually give you the logic I can give you two types of logic one is very simple I've always tried to be authentic I've always tried to hear what is it to be me right now and to be aligned with it, you know, and so the answers to that question have led me to different parts of the world, to different types of professions and experiences and apprenticeships and so on and so forth what does it mean being authentic? I need to get to the bottom of that first yeah, there are so many ways of looking at it, but it's kind of a it's an instinct that you have inside of you that when you feel like your your being true to yourself a feeling that I'm walking the path that I ought to walk and it's because it feels right to me and not because someone else has said that it's great, not because I'm trying to please someone else, not because I'm trying to, you know, go after some addiction of power or money or any kind of success, which are all external things, bottomless pits, which in any case have never made anybody happy for more than a few moments so I'm going to try to not be after those external things but that feeling inside, when you feel, you know, it's kind of vertical you feel good you feel inside yeah, that feels right ok now Nadine this is perfect because I am I'm right at the the age group where I'm at the intersection of making career decisions, I'm choosing a major in college or I'm applying to different units in the ADF or choosing internships and jobs and we have these external forces I feel that I'm I'm fortunate to be able to go on a path that and my parents are supporting me and saying whatever you feel is right to you go but I'm seeing so many people around me that are struggling with this dissonance how can it even how can you even expect people at least my age to be able to go through that inner path piece and not succumb to the other pressures? yeah, it starts with self-awareness it starts with inner curiosity you know, basically, I started my true true journey maybe let me tell you a few words about my journey and then I can answer your question really so I grew-up in Paris, which is such a privilege, because you get exposed to so much culture and intellect and richness and I was a true product of the french excellence educational system I went to the equivalent of the Ivy Leagues of high school, prep school, business school, all of it but I had something inside of me always telling me you can't go into the conventional past like you're gonna die it's my own instinct you know, it's my own instinct of knowing yeah what is not you already that's a good start, right? yeah and one day one night I didn't sleep and it just like I put everything together and I was like, yeah, I'm going to New York I'm going to work in publishing because I love history I also studied history New York is a free place where you can discover who you are you can explore nobody cares Ok a big shift, right so that was my first one and then, of course, then life happens and it's not exactly what you think and so that's what your question is like I always believe, like, you don't do destiny you show up, you do your homework, and destiny does destiny you know, like you meet certain people in ways that you could never plan like you have all those sorts of things like that then direct you and I ended up moving on and developing within a classical music company, which was back then the biggest portal online for classical music and also a record label and I was 24 and I was probably, wait wait wait, so you got you went you came to New York to do publishing and yeah and then at 24 my age and then you came to found the world's most popular classical music portal online yeah ok that's what I mean you don't do destiny you show up, do homework you work hard and there are all those things that you cannot control of encounters like I met this amazing man who was also the lawyer for Ifsa Rohan you know, the fashion designer and was with them that we did that and so and I went around the world and I was supposed to so much and I learned so much but in parallel to that, I had this thing about the inner curiosity, like I had to understand myself better and I started that journey in parallel in parallel ok and I so I was very curious, I was driven by that need and I ended up meeting a number of teachers, you know so let's call it wisdom schools you know, people we're old souls and teach you a lot of deep things and philosophies and spiritual is a terry traditions I also ended up in therapy with someone who had studied with Carl Jung oh, wow one of the biggest psychologists of all time and was also one of so I spent many years with him and what her her mentor was Carl Jung one of Carl Jung's right hands that's incredible yeah and then at some point she thought that I should take on her legacy, I should continue her work so I was also trained in that woah and in parallel to that, I joined a drumming circle where we were working with shamans from around the world and so you're asking, what are shamans those so in every single culture on Earth yeah before the operation of monotheistic religions, for instance, in each village, you know, there was always a shaman shaman is a word a Tungus word, which is a tribe in Northern Eastern Siberia Ok so every time is not the words, so it doesn't matter but it was like someone who could usually use drum or other things to go into trance, to go to different state of consciousness ok to access information useful for the community, whether the future or to heal and when they do that through into an intensive drumming circle or drumming ritual well, in almost every tradition, a drum is involved but sometimes they take stuff, you know, like ayahuasca you may have heard ... I heard about that yeah after all but anyway, so I wasn't for the record I haven't tried it, but I've heard about it ok the point is that with drums just the sound of drum because it goes like your heartbeat it kind of tunes down your left brain and you can access more your right brain if you want to put it in those metaphoric terms very quickly recap, what is the difference between left and right, remind me like a more intellectual, you tone down the intellectual side and you can more the creative, craved, intuitive, you know, like all those other things wonderful and that was so you see ahead it was amazing to work with those shamans from all those different traditions and native Americans, Siberians, and all this because they still have a connection to nature, to the elements, to the wisdom of life that we're often lost in the western world so it was very enriching so put all those things together and all those currents have formed me, you know, and at some point wow after six years in New York, it felt like I was done and the guidance came in a shamanic journey that to become who I'm meant to become I have to move to Mongolia and I had never thought in my life that I would do that and it sounded quite insane but I had this if I can imagine myself going to my parents and my girlfriend and saying, guys, you know, I've been in Palo Alto for a while I love the startup world but to be who I really want to be, I have to go to Mongolia yeah, exactly and a part of me was saying exactly the same but then there were so many coincidences and I it was like just so insane, you know and it felt like yeah I have to do this and I started doing a lot of homework and I ended up in Mongolia thinking, I'm going to be trained in shamanism or something, because that's a place where those traditions are still very much there but two days after my arrival, I met this amazing, amazing human being, Oyuun, who was back then the leading female politician of the country who was in college that had just won parliamentary elections and gradually I became her right hand so I was in government I was seeing how the government works, the parliament I was working in the Mongolian parliament you were working in the Mongolian parliament, too and you met her two days after coming to Mongolia to to be more equipped with a shaman ritual exactly so, you see, that's what life is you show up, you do your homework I had done a ton of homework to know so many people in Mongolia but I could have never planned to end up having the Mongolian soldiers saluting me every morning and every evening was when I was entering the main building of the country Nadine you have to come to this to the experiences as open minded, right because I'm sure that in the same token that you had these experiences, you could have missed them if you weren't open to accepting them as another case exactly that's what I'm saying you show up yeah do your homework and destiny does destiny you know, so you're open but also you look what feels right what doesn't feel right I feel its like dialogue between your intuitions and things that flow in your life you know, I think what he called you called a synchronicities, you know, when there are weird coincidences and you're like, wow, I should really look in that direction, you know ok, so Nadine just to make sure that I'm following the track let's recap so Paris businesses like business and Ivy Leagues and everything great and then you move to New York for publishing but you actually go to create a musical, a classic music portal, but then you fall in love with the shaman rituals so you go to Mongolia to study that but you actually and and somewhere in the process, there where you study with Carl Jung's right right hand person and then you end up leading with a politician meeting a female politician I always loved politics I always I studied international affairs also so, you know, you can't take things literally shamanism is about accessing information to transform reality and one way to do it is through politics and development of policy and I love it so so, you know, from that angle, she said to me all over Asia to represent her or Mongolia, which was hilarious I spent time in Siberia, in Central Asia we were in North Korea, all sorts of adventures what did you say about North Korea? we were official guests for some celebration you know, it was like not not inside North Korea yeah inside you went inside North Korea yeah but back then, a lot of people were it was a period when they were opening up well, you're the first person that I met that got to be inside North Korea so officially, I got what I what I wanted from 20 minute leaders no but, you know, anyway, it was just like an education and exposure to a lot of a lot of things and at the same time, it's minus 40 in the winter It's the coldest capital in the world and at some point, I felt like, listen, I can't stay for the rest of my life, you know, trying to give everything I have to help this country It felt like something had to move, you know and again, I was like, but where next? no idea and then in one of the conferences where Oyuun had sent me, I met a minister in the Tibetan government in exile you know, the government in exile of the Dalai Lama and he invited me to India to a teaching of the Dalai Lama and it just felt right to it with my next one way ticket, one suitcase let me go to India one suitcase yes and then in India, again, the guidance and from one thing to another, I ended up in New Delhi, the capital where I did a couple of things I actually developed my therapy coaching practice and I ended up doing amazing, amazing, amazing work it was fascinating within the Indian culture, within the Indian society what what type of therapy was this? well, it's a combination of union, right yeah there is energy and spiritual practices and business leadership strategy stuff basically, it's one on one coaching, mentorship, therapy, that combination yeah, exactly and I was working with a lot of fascinating people in politics and business, and design and arts and all of this and in parallel to that, I had TV shows on national television like I was doing a morning show interviewing Indian personalities on the meaning of life in New Delhi yeah I also had a weekly column was interviewing every week another personality on the meaning of spirituality, which was amazing and super interesting. and I met amazing people like that and I felt I mean, I felt very much at home in India, I resonated a lot with the the spiritual you breathe spirituality you breathe a different understanding of life, which talks to me a lot and it was just an absolutely fascinating time so, wow and that's a place where I thought I would always stay but somehow life guided me differently why am I not surprised yeah but I am in a different phase now but I'm just giving you a different apprenticeships I've had and so I moved to California in 2012 and I mostly focused on my coaching counselling work basically, I, call it a joint journey because it's not coaching or therapy does it I don't resonate with those words so much I call it a joint journey because it's really a journey with another person you know, it's in with other person where the tool box is rich you know it can be depth psychology it can be working with dreams to help you understand what's going on inside of you a lot of trans-generation work because it turns out we carry so much baggage from the generations before us and if we don't understand that, we are controlled by that and that's not a life well lived authentically, you know so trans-generation work combined with the business stuff or political stuff or media stuff, and all of this comes into my work I work one on one with people and then with their companies when they own a company, you know it depends cases I work with people in Europe, in the US, in India, wow in Asia and the rest of Asia, actually in Israel, a couple of people so I'm mostly focusing on that right now and it feels wonderful it's like the confluence of all the streams of my life yeah, there were some Hawaii in there right if I recall correctly yes I wanted to make it short so I between New York and Mongolia all the synchronicities were leading me to the big island of Hawaii, which is the which has an active volcano and where I went, you know, like totally like a reset button it was like a reset button of all my Western life I spent time next to the lava flows it was extremely powerful what I went through at a very, very deep level, and then it was like, ok, I was ready to go how long were you there for? less than a year less than six months even but it was really, really powerful ok, Nadine, this is just insane I'm so sad that we have about four minutes left this is ok you know what let's make it easy I'm coming now to you and I'm looking for some free advice and I I'd love to know, you know, you've gone through so many experiences and so many authentic experiences I don't want to know how to be successful I want to know how to be content so give me and whoever else would be interested in this what are some of your earned secrets after these experiences? of of what is it mean to really be content and be authentic in a very tangible way? what can people do in the 21st century when we're guided by all these technologies and all of these, you know, races to be to climb the ladder of success at 22 years old? How can we deal with that? first of all, just to ask that question is already it feels to me like a big chunk of the work, you know, just to be aware that if you just race and race and race, you know, as they often say, it's like putting the ladder, climbing the ladder, and then you realize it's on the wrong wall First of all, ask the question to me one way one easy way to ask that question is to imagine you're 99 years old ok and I ask you, what is for you? was it a life well lived? and you just imagine was it a life well lived and can you just imagine what would it entail at the age of ninety nine for you to tell me, yes, it was a life well lived can we trust people my age to have to think to have that thought well, that's my second point, is that the answer to that will change over time and that's too fine the point is, ask the question try to ask the question, but ask it again and again, right It's not asking one time and that's it yeah, you don't have a definitive answer no definitive answer this is my second point keep asking because it changes third point and life is a mystery so third point, the answer to what is a life well lived is gonna be very different inside of you if you ask the one who talks about everything you want to create or invent as an entrepreneur everything that you have like it that you want to do for the world that could impact your meaning for society that's one type of answer if you have a side in you, that's like a child and just wants to play if you only work, it's never going to be a life well live for that side so can we ask that side too, third if we ask the one we knew that might want to create a family, for instance, a life well lived the answer has nothing to do with a guy who is the entrepreneur inside of you right, or if I talk about a lover inside of you who wants to have a gorgeous chemical relationship with your partner do you think it's gonna be the same answer as, again, the entrepreneur or the child or the father no you're just complicating things Nadine, it's just too hard and give it it's not hard at all the point is, if you understand that inside you I'll tell you and that's my my next point that's where I'm going that curiosity that I was telling you about at the beginning to try to understand yourself better you have that curiosity about yourself now, that's what's going to lead you to authenticity it's basically, can you take a flashlight and go inside yourself, can you discover those different facets inside of you because they have different needs they have different messages for you they have different fears you know, they have different modes of operating I love it, so can you explore that a little bit and maybe inside of you does a rebel who doesn't care about any of that maybe inside of you there's also an inner critic who's also trying telling you are not good enough not good enough, or whatever there's a hermit who just wants to explore in the mountains I have no idea but can we take a flashlight, explore that because if you do that you get to know yourself a little bit more so, by definition, it's more authentic, the life you need I love it you see what I mean no, no 100 % interesting but I'm also aware that it has to be some sort of balance where, you know, I wouldn't want my future 14 year old daughter to come to me and say, daddy, now I'm dropping out of of ninth grade because my inner self says that I should go and and to do something else, right so, I mean, I do think there should be some balance where we have a path that gives us the tools to be able to think critically and be successful in whatever we do and and you obviously did a lot of that before you went on to experience. do you think that's valid or should we also entertain for much younger people who feel that way? actually, for me, though, so I've developed a tool I called a round table of inner characters because I've found that most people have about ten or twelve of those characters all of us ok but at the head of the table is lewis round, meaning it's equal and I want to make sure I hear from everyone, ok The doer, the lover, the caretaker all of them yup me at the head of the table is what I call the wise one ok the wise one is the one who has a sense of balance, has a sense of yeah it's not about quitting everything and jumping and taking a one way ticket and one suitcase and going to the North Pole you know, that has its limitations the wise one is gonna find a balance between certain drives, certain intuitions, you know, certain ideas, certain instincts and that's the only one that can actually synthesize all of it and do something that is actually not insane that will help you walk that path for life well lived so much inspiration I just love this talk so much thank you for the time I have to put you on the spot once and I know it's not fair but I will I want you to tell me three words that you would best describe yourself I usually I say I am an explorer so definitely, I'm an explorer that's that's an easy one a couple of others I have to tell, you now? we can do this later, but I think that everybody would like it just having gone through this all these experiences I mean I mainly interested what type of personality leads people to do what they do? you know, a lot of entrepreneurs are telling me they're passionate A lot of CEOs are telling me that they're empathetic and they're sensitive to other people, their leaders a lot of creative people say that they're artistic and and etc are obviously an explorer what else? what else how else would you characterize it or how else would your colleagues characterize you? well, since I was little, I was talking to people much, much older than me about the meaning of life a philosopher? so you can say a philosopher or a priestess or something like that about the seeker ritual side, you know, a spiritual side wanting to go deep, really deep, as deep as possible so it's about the wisdom, you know so that's a very real art to me. and then, yeah, the third one, I'll tell you next time, huh? that's that you know, and I think that it's also amazing how, you know, sometimes they get answers very quickly, as if it's rehearsed and people know it sometimes it's very it's very, very difficult and I think that shows a part of it, this inquisitiveness and this not being willing to settle for a definitive characteristic, but being constantly under exploration and I think having only two out of the three is a part of the journey that you're on to continue exploring and I'm learning from that because I think we truly, truly, truly are a mystery in so many ways. I love it and it keeps unfolding I love it Nadine, thank you so much I really appreciate it you're welcome
