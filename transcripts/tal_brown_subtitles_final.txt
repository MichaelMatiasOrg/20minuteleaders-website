Tal Brown, Zone7 Thank you for joining me. My pleasure. Thank you for having me man. You know, it's so cool because in all my social media, I wrote you on all my contacts as Tal Brown Zone7 and your Zoom link says that as well. So, from now, like your company is attached to your name. It's a part of your identity. Well you know why because I read somewhere a while ago that to add your company name to your Google account name will mean that every time somebody sees an e-mail or you log in, it'll say, Tal Brown Zone7. So, I did that and I forgot about it. And now it's everywhere. Now you can never rebrand no matter what you do. For me, you're gonna be Tal Brown Zone7. Tal, what is Zone7? What is this thing? Zone7 is software, that is artificial intelligence software that helps you make decisions about how hard to push yourself physically. When to rest. When to train harder, with the objective of performing at your peak for longer. Right. And in sports, it means less injuries, dramatically less injuries. Staying in that peak shape for longer and longer periods. Amazing. So, for me, that's a fascinating field. My girlfriend just finished Stanford. She actually just won the national championship in soccer as a striker. And I know that that is very relevant to what you're doing. And it's very relevant because one of the main things that she was telling me was that it's incredible how many injuries they have on the team. And she's explaining to me how they push them physically throughout the trainings. And honestly, it's not that surprising that half of her team is constantly in some sort of injury. But, Tal, tell me about Zone7 and how do you use AI and software to help reduce the injuries? So when somebody gets injured, something breaks down. Maybe they were pushed a little bit beyond their limit for that day. Right And your limits change, right? You could do something on a Monday you couldn't do on a Tuesday. And it's really hard to figure out that limit 'cause it changes from day to day and it depends on a lot of stuff. It depends on your sleep, and on your nutrition, and on your current workout and previous workout, and how well you recovered and all that stuff. And so, for one person looking after 20, 30 athletes, like a soccer team, solving that puzzle for every single player every day is really complicated. And as a technology in the technology sector, there's a couple of things we've done over the years to help. The first thing is to collect data. So, we've helped collect data. We've got sensors on the backs of soccer players and basketball players and hockey players that measure movement and running and sprinting and jumping. So, we're collecting data about sleep as well and all that stuff. The second thing we're doing is we're helping visualize the data. So, we've got all the Excel, spreadsheets, and we've got the CRMs, and we've got the tableaus. We can plot every single parameter that we have about you. But what we haven't done really well is to enable accurate interpretation of the data. Right. And what I mean is that, what is your trend mean today? How does that relate to other soccer players at your age that have been injured in the past? Right. What should you do? It's not just about red flag. You know, we should give you advice on how to tweak your training. How far can we push you without breaking you? You know why I love this so much is because I was an athlete myself. I played varsity tennis and volleyball in high school. And one, I think it's not just about a trainer being accountable and looking at their 20 players and measuring them on a daily basis and knowing how to push them. But the promise that you're attaching emotions into the training. And when you have a game coming up, you may be blinded by putting in the extra effort. Yeah, what are the chances. They can handle it. They're just crybabies. They can do it. When you're talking about software, and when you're talking about just data that's giving the feedback. It doesn't take into account that you have a game tomorrow. It merely looks at the statistics and says, "Based on your current assessment, you're prone for an injury" Right? Yes and no. So the cold data does not understand schedules and does not understand emotions, but today what we do is it's not just about the data. It's about understanding your weekly schedule. Is this a Tuesday? Is this a Wednesday? Is this a Thursday? Are you playing on a Saturday? Who are you playing? What's a typical game against those opponents look like for you? What are the demands that we think you will need to do in order to win on that game? So there's that context, and in soccer specifically it's called the Microcycle. A weekly cadence of getting ready for a game on the weekend. Basketball's a bit different. Baseball as well because they're playing more, but it's the same principle. It's basically making sure you're peaking for a game and then letting you recover and train hard in between. And as for emotions I don't wanna like speculate about emotions, but today you've got products that are available for a couple of hundred bucks that take very good measure of your recovery, of your stress, of your heart rate when you're resting or sleeping. And that doesn't differentiate being angry versus being upset versus being sad but it does measure very accurately how your body is responding when you're not training. So, we can call it recovery data or wellness data, but it is hard data. And if we understand what a typical recovery for you looks like that allows you to perform a really good game, then we can see if you're there or not and we can help calibrate that on a day to day basis. Tal coming, for somebody who doesn't really follow sports actively, now I'm following because of Carly, but for somebody who's not really following actively, it doesn't seem like injuries are that prevalent because I'm seeing Messi go on the field every game and Ronaldo is playing every game. And so, but I know that it's a big deal because you're going after a big market and therefore, I trust you. But Tal, give me a little bit of a rundown. What is the scope of injuries that we're seeing today in sports? So, I think you're getting a biased view of how big the problem is because of your just because of your Maybe it's also timeline because of covid, less sports in North America. But you look at what's going on in the UK, in Europe right now? Dozens of players are down with injuries. Arsenal had seven injuries in like two weeks of games. These are devastating, right? The difference between winning and losing over a season can be one or two injuries. And you look at Messi, there's a little study that sometimes I refer  to, he was down for about six weeks, I think it was two years ago. And if you look at the number of points per week that Barcelona were able to get with and without him, it's measurable. So, about 20 to 30% of a soccer squad is out every given moment. Really? 20 to 30%? And is that mostly stress related or is that mostly because collisions and whatnot? So, it's basically about two thirds, 70% are what's called soft tissue injuries. So, not contact related. Wow. So pulling a hamstring, tearing your ACL, groin, ankle, and some of it is contact, but I'll tell you this. Contact injuries, we cannot predict what happens when two people collide fast on a soccer pitch or a hockey ice rink, contact often aggravates an existing issue. Huh. So, not to say it's predictable, but to say that if you can quantify how strained certain things are, then the likelihood of contact to bring you over the tipping point for an injury is greater. So, it's a huge problem and it's huge in sports. You look at the NBA finals last year determined on both sides by one side being extremely healthy, and the other side being extremely unlucky after five years of phenomenal success with injuries. But for us as a company, sports is a first market. If you look at a wider field of employers and employees, people who are under physical and mental stress for living, that market is even bigger, right? So Messi, you wanna help Messi. You wanna help Durant. You wanna help Tom Brady. But ultimately, you've got doctors working under extremely difficult mental conditions in hospitals. You've got oil and gas workers under a lot of stress. You've got manufacturing, factories So for us, that's the horizon. And we're already deploying, using our success in soccer and hockey and baseball, to deploy into environments like ERs and steel working plans. I have to say that is so cool. And you know when we met for the first time a few months ago, and I was so inspired by what you're doing, it's because I was reflecting back on my experience in the Eilat Desert Marathon of 2017. And it's such a monumental moment for me both because I managed to finish it, but also because it was a disastrous moment for me because since then I've been dealing with knee problems. And almost every person that I talked to told me, "Michael, you're gonna injure yourself. You don't know what you're doing. You're gonna push your body past what it can do." I had no contact injury. I didn't mistep at any point. I finished the marathon. I was feeling great. I went into my ice bath and I couldn't get up. My body just couldn't handle the stress of running all that distance. And I think to myself that when I said emotions before, that was my mental state that I was ignorant enough to not listen to the doctors and the therapists because I thought I didn't really believe them. But if I had data that showed me, Michael, based on your training and based on the training of others who got injured in long distance running, we think you're at risk. I think that that would give me much more confident than listening to a trainer who I think might have maybe something against me or doesn't really want me to succeed. So, I think trainers are extremely important because ultimately software doesn't understand you. We don't hear your voice. We don't understand your emotions. There's a lot of stuff we don't capture. Not to say we can't. So, we're really helpful with the data stuff. But ultimately, a trainer is important. It's kind of like a pilot, right? Inventing GPS did not get any pilot fired. It just gave them a really good navigational tool instead of looking at the stars as they're crossing the Atlantic trying to figure out if this is the right way. Right. So, trainers will continue to be there but we're just gonna give them better and better tools. And in the sense of detecting risk, they're gonna have a compass that's gonna be super accurate all the time. That's where we're headed, right? We're not gonna get rid of trainers, but we will get rid of certain grey areas where people make biased decisions. Think about stock trading, right? 30 years ago, probably stock traders would have said, "There's no way computers could do this better than we could." Right? And today nobody on his right mind would consider not using some kind of automated system for that. So, sports is changing as well, a little bit slower or a little bit after some other industries, but it's gonna happen. Tal, I think that's so cool. I wanna hear about your background. How do you get to do something like this? You move from Israel to Palo Alto, a part of UpWest Labs that are so kindly sponsoring the series. I mean, how do you even get to build an AI software for sports? So, my story's somewhat unique in the sports technology field. I'm not a sports guy. Didn't play. Didn't train. Didn't treat players. Didn't manage players. I spent my early careers in Israel Shmone Matayim creating big data products for the intelligence community. Then I spent some time at Salesforce. I was one of the first product managers at Salesforce to work on predictive technology. This isn't a time where 2012, '13, nobody wanted to hear about this. I was kicked out of meetings for about a year. We will never do AI. We're not that kind of company. Go back to your dreams in Tel Aviv. And the world changed. And I was on that journey with Salesforce. So, I learned how to create products that use machine learning to help, I would say non-technical people, not scientists or engineers, do their job better and faster. How do you measure the success of this product? How do you build it? How do you craft it? How do you visualize recommendations to a user who is not a scientist? Right. So, I did that for a living and it was a great journey, Salesforce is an incredible company. And then kind of like the stars aligned. I wanted to do my thing. I wanted to start a company. I met my co-founder who is a sports scientist of phenomenal talent. And we had a pilot. We had two pilots in Israel, right? And if you know Israel, you know, there's a lot of good stuff about Israel, but it's not a sports superpower. It is not a sports superpower. That is definitely not. But we got lucky. We got lucky because one of the only real sports VIPs in Israel, Jordi Cruyff, who used to coach Maccabi and is a very famous soccer player. He was coaching the team that we had a pilot with and he saw it and he said, "Oh, this is working, contrary to what I was led to believe my entire life about soccer injuries." And he said, "All right, I'm gonna help you guys" And I'm gonna, and he joined the company as an adviser and investor. And the next thing that happened was meeting UpWest. And basically, it's glad they're also sponsoring me. They were the first firm, the first investor to say, "This could be big. We believe in this, but you gotta play by our rules and that means get yourself to Silicon Valley, spend some time with us here" because the more time you spend in the market you wanna grow in, the more likely you are to succeed. It's not a guarantee. It's just, it just makes sense. So, I literally quit my job. Signed a paper with UpWest and a couple of days later, I was on a plane. And I left my wife and my two kids in Israel for four weeks at a time, coming to here to work, to connect, to build the company. Really? Yeah. So, I did like pretty brutal, ... like army style. Like four weeks Palo Alto one or two weeks at home for about 18 months. and then once we kind of got a - - Wow Yeah. So, the big hero here is my wife. And we can do a whole podcast about my wife. Of course. And then 18 months later we had a seed round and I relocated the entire family to Palo Alto. So, it's a bit of a crazy journey. Somewhat crazy in the sense of like just living a really weird life for a while, but I'm seeing the company grow, which is phenomenal. I'm seeing more investors come in. I'm seeing more success. So, I gotta say, the UpWest thesis is definitely something that I believe in very strongly. Tal, that's just incredible. And your daughter goes to the same elementary school that I went to which is the most exciting part of this whole conversation, I have to say because I had such a phenomenal childhood here across the street and Go dragons Go dragons. And I'm actually I'm really jealous of her. The handball wall, there is two handball walls, that's where I spent my entire elementary school. So, if she ever needs tips on how to win there, I know all the dirty tricks of this game. Well, she, this kid came into here last summer, didn't speak a word of English. And yesterday she read to me Green Eggs and Ham right before she went to bed. So, we talk about AI in sports, but kids have it just like that. Effortless learning. I think it's a wonderful gift that you are giving her. For me, growing up more of an international background and going back and forth and having both the Israeli mindset, but also the American mindset. They complement each other with all their differences that I think it makes for something very very special. If you want, I can do the Israeli interview, but up to you. Exactly. Tal, reflect with me on the startup journey. Now that you have great traction, you're going and you're deploying this in different spaces. I didn't even know that you're going now into places that are not just sports, which is I think it's incredible. What advice would you give to young entrepreneurs, perhaps young entrepreneurs out of Shmone Matayim that are working on building their software. Their market may be here, but it's not that easy to make the move, pick up the family and go to Silicon Valley. So, what advice would you give to these young entrepreneurs? Well, I'll say a couple of things. First of all, I did this a little bit later in my career. So, on one hand, I had a family which was a great great force of stabilization for my life. On the other hand, I had more tools in my professional toolbox. I worked in Salesforce. I was a PM. I did sales before. So, I had naiveté, but a little bit differently than if I would be like 25, 26. So, I would say this, first of all, don't be scared to spend another couple of years in your career working for a company, just be sure to spend it where you think would be the most ROI for your future journey. So, don't just go to a job, work with friends because we're the guys from the ... and whatever. No and so many people are looking at jobs because of the difference in a few thousand dollars a year. Look, you know it's like chess. You don't have to look 15 years down the road. Look three years down the road. What's gonna best prepare you for that next thing? And for me, the product management experience and the Salesforce experience as an American innovative company, that was huge for my career. So, that's one. Plan a little bit ahead and don't be scared to work for a couple of years. Nothing's gonna happen. I started my company, let's say, more than 10 years after I finished Shmone Matayim So that's one. Number two is, aim big. Go to the US. Right? UpWest is a phenomenal fund. They're not the only way to do it, but the more time you spend here, it'ls like your thinking is going to change. It doesn't mean Israeli ecosystem is not phenomenal, but regardless of the identity of your investor, come to the US spend as much time as you can here. It's really weird in the beginning, but it pays dividends later. I'm sure. And the third thing is really, it's obvious but it's so true. It's resilience. You've gotta be prepared. You're gonna be in a mental space where you're okay with getting slapped on the face or getting rejected 100 times a day. Not to say that happens every day, but it does happen occasionally. So, you've gotta be on your feet. You've gotta be happy in the journey and you've gotta push forward because there will be hard days. You gotta be ready for it. You've gotta want it, right. So, resilience is really important. I'll use a Samurai metaphor: A sword doesn't become strong just because it's a sword. It becomes strong because it gets hit with boiling hot hammers a thousand times. So, or 10,000 times. So, that's how you forge a sword. So you've gotta That's the process. Tal, I love it. 20 minutes go by so fast. I have to know the most important question, three words that you would use to describe yourself or that Shuly and Gil, our friends would use to describe you. So, I'll say this. I'll say, Dad. I'll say Third Culture Kid as one word because it's one concept. And I'll say, wow third one, I think courageous is a word, not that I'm great but I’ve learned to jump in the water when it's really hard and to swim. That's the most important I think. It's incredible. And I mean that's the trait that allows you to go and explore whatever you wanna do. All right man. Good luck with your journey. You're doing phenomenal work and thank you UpWest for sponsoring this. Tal, toda raba. Really amazing. And I can't wait for  our dinner in August, September, whenever that happens, whenever this whole thing calms down. All right man. Take care. Speak soon.
