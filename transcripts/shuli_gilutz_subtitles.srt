1
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,499
All right. Shuli Gilutz,

2
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,932
thank you so much for joining me.

3
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:13,866
Great to be here or there. Somewhere.

4
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:14,732
Who knows anymore.

5
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:17,499
Shuli, what does it mean to be an expert

6
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,932
on Children’s User Experience in digital?

7
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:22,099
What does that mean?

8
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,766
It's a great question.

9
00:02:23,767 --> 00:02:25,499
Because I don't know if the word digital

10
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,532
like how that expertise or experience.

11
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:29,666
But generally what we look at is how

12
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,399
to design environment deal,

13
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,732
environment interactive,

14
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:33,832
environments for kids.

15
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,532
Which are [--]

16
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:36,799
So, [--] design.

17
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,199
It started out with a more cognitive focus

18
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,832
in terms of learning and a tech gen.

19
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:45,066
But today we talk about social, relevant

20
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:45,899
and emotional

21
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,366
and all these other challenges

22
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,866
that we have in designing.

23
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:51,299
Okay. So, when you talk about children,

24
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,499
what demographic are you an expert on?

25
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,199
What demographic are we talking about?

26
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,932
So, children zero to 18

27
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:01,199
that's the legal boundaries.

28
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,566
Even though research today talks about

29
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:06,266
childhood ending in around 25.

30
00:03:06,267 --> 00:03:10,866
So, I'm still a kid. Great. Finally.

31
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:11,799
I have a confirmation

32
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,166
that I can be a kid again.

33
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:13,966
Wonderful.

34
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:16,966
There you are. But legally 18.

35
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:18,499
I guess it depends on different countries.

36
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,832
Some countries legal age

37
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:20,932
for different things

38
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:23,232
There are areas in US 21 for some things.

39
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:25,332
But legally zeros to 18.

40
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,766
So, you know it's such a confusing time.

41
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:29,099
And it's such a fascinating time

42
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,932
to think about this.

43
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:31,766
Because I'm looking at all this

44
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:33,466
social media apps that are rising.

45
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:35,799
And it's incredible to see how,

46
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,966
I'm 24. I consider myself a child still.

47
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:40,866
And a very young user.

48
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:43,599
Yet I use Facebook primarily

49
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,732
than Instagram.

50
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:46,832
I don’t really know what Tiktok is.

51
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,399
But I heard that I'm supposed to be there.

52
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,832
But it's crazy. Because already I feel

53
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,932
illiterate when it comes to the usage

54
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:58,566
of how young people use social media

55
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:02,199
and interact with it overall.

56
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,532
So, tell me a little bit about

57
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:06,132
what is the study that you're doing?

58
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:08,699
And what are the differences between

59
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,832
the way that young people

60
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,899
use these things

61
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,199
versus the older generations?

62
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,232
Like myself.

63
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:17,499
So, exactly that's a great question.

64
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,932
Because you would not be considered

65
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:20,566
an old generation. You're a millennial.

66
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:22,899
I mean you're the younger generation.

67
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,099
Right? But what we see now is fascinating.

68
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,599
I've been in this field for about 20 years.

69
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,299
And we've always divided up kids

70
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,366
to five, eight years. Right?

71
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:31,666
So, you have your babies. Your toddlers.

72
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:34,399
Early elementary. Tweens and teens.

73
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,499
You think that that would be enough.

74
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,432
But apparently, it's not.

75
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:39,632
Because it turns out that every five years

76
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:41,199
there's this jump in technology.

77
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,299
And what happens is

78
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,866
It's not that the children become smarter.

79
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,332
Evolution doesn’t happen over five years.

80
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,032
It happens over millions of years.

81
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:50,932
So what the differences is,

82
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:52,166
that when they're born with

83
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,332
certain technologies as a baseline,

84
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,832
They start from there.

85
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,032
And that's what the minimum

86
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:58,399
they expect everything

87
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,132
to work in a certain way.

88
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,532
So, you can even see what kids today

89
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:04,199
like I teach children one is 13

90
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,366
and one is almost 10.

91
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:07,632
So, my 13 years old, when he searches

92
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:09,632
goes primarily to tech space search,

93
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:11,432
YouTube, other sites.

94
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:14,132
My 10-year-old. When she was very young.

95
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:16,666
When she was four, YouTube Kids came out.

96
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:18,699
And I showed it to her.

97
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,099
And it has voice search.

98
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,432
So, she would go, "Elsa."

99
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:24,666
And it would play Let It Go whatever.

100
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:26,399
She uses voice search today.

101
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,532
She could write. She could do anything.

102
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:29,666
It just open a gap.

103
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:31,632
And he never use voice search.

104
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:32,532
Why would he use voice search.

105
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:33,032
He could type.

106
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:35,199
But he's 13. So, we see already those

107
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,732
a few years have very different behaviors.

108
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,532
And we see that with boys a lot today.

109
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:41,532
Kids growing up with Alexa at home,

110
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,566
and Google home and Siri

111
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:45,232
They treat voice very naturally.

112
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:46,966
While kids who are just a few years older

113
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:50,366
and 20-year olds like yourself,

114
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:53,266
are like, "Okay. Maybe I'll use Siri here.

115
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:54,266
Maybe I'll use voice there.

116
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:56,532
But younger kid do it. It's just so natural to them.

117
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:57,566
Because they was always there.

118
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:59,499
Like their Legos and like their other books.

119
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,866
It was even there before they were able

120
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:03,966
to read and write, they were able to speak

121
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:06,266
and therefore if that's an option

122
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:08,332
on YouTube Kids then that becomes

123
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,966
their default way.

124
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:11,899
Exactly. And they're just used to it.

125
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,632
And when adults use it, they are like

126
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:15,866
Okay. What should I say?

127
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:16,666
What's the command?

128
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,732
What's the right thing to do?

129
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:20,132
yeah. I think that's fascinating.

130
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:23,399
Because it must been already few years.

131
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,232
My father is in Google and I've seen him

132
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:26,532
talk to his Google assistant

133
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:28,666
and I hate voice.

134
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:29,399
I can’t voice it.

135
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,299
I don't do the right command.

136
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,366
My phone doesn’t understand me.

137
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:34,399
I feel so old when it comes to this.

138
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,699
So, now I'm thinking that he's a revolutionary.

139
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,466
That in his great age and he's been

140
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:41,566
using it for years. But it makes sense

141
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,999
that the new generations,

142
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,466
that's where they are gonna be adapted to.

143
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:46,099
So, this is where we should capitalize.

144
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,632
So, what else?

145
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:48,299
What other differences we have?

146
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:48,999
Well I have to say though,

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,966
in defense of your father,

148
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:52,532
this is not a typical in his generation

149
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:53,132
I would say.

150
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:55,632
But actually voice is very big

151
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:57,632
with the older generation. Older adults.

152
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:59,266
Because it, again, allows them

153
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:00,899
to do things that maybe is harder

154
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,832
for them in other ways.

155
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:02,866
So, they are actually

156
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:04,032
early adapters in that area.

157
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:05,066
Which is really interesting.

158
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:05,499
I mean there are a lot of

159
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,066
[--]

160
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:08,266
and others.

161
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:10,432
But voice is very big. And in many ways.

162
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:12,166
I have this colleague who talks about

163
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:13,966
designing for older adults.

164
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,432
And a lot of times we find ourselves

165
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:16,532
together in conferences.

166
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:17,466
Me talking about kids.

167
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:18,599
And him talking about adults.

168
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,299
Oh, that's awesome.

169
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,966
Oh, that is so cool. Yeah.

170
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:23,399
Very interesting.

171
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,566
But the thing about kids is that

172
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:27,066
they're not afraid.

173
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:28,799
So, that's why kids are such great learners.

174
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,032
They take a phone and say,

175
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,132
"Hmn, what will happen if I put this

176
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:34,199
in the toilet? That was cool."

177
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,032
And the parents are like, "Aaahh."

178
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:36,699
And they put it in.

179
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,299
And they have to put it

180
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,399
in rights or whatever.

181
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,799
Just so you know, rights.

182
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,966
But they're curious.

183
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:42,732
And they try everything.

184
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:44,199
So, when you try everything,

185
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,732
You figure that.

186
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:45,799
That's how you learn the best.

187
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,699
When you are like,

188
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,766
Oh my God, what will I press?

189
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:48,732
What do I do?

190
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:49,699
Then you don't learn anything.

191
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,699
Then it's much slower.

192
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,732
It's not that they're smarter.

193
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:53,266
It's just they're more open.

194
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:54,066
They're not afraid.

195
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,799
They don't care that it cost so much.

196
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,632
That's why they're great learners.

197
00:07:57,633 --> 00:07:59,066
Especially in technology.

198
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:01,032
And also the fact that they're not,

199
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:02,399
especially the younger kids

200
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,132
they're not really aware to

201
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:05,166
what we mean by technology.

202
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:07,266
If you talk to young children, you ask them,

203
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:09,032
You know, what's your favorite technology?

204
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:10,032
They will be like,

205
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:12,432
The refrigerator. The car.

206
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:14,599
Technology's everywhere. Right?

207
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,632
The distinction between digital,

208
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:18,032
that's why I said UX digital,

209
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:19,166
and a non-digital

210
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:20,832
is a very old distinction.

211
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,899
It's an adult thing.

212
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,699
Because you work in high tech.

213
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,432
Whatever that means.

214
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:26,099
They don't care you're creating stuff.

215
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,732
For fun, for game, for learning, for play.

216
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:30,566
And they don't care if Lego has center

217
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:32,432
or doesn’t have centers. Or a fun game.

218
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:34,066
Yeah. That's what they care about.

219
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:36,366
So, these distinctions are very like

220
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:38,232
top down and very adult

221
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:39,566
and not relevant to their lives.

222
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:40,966
They are looking at the final product.

223
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:41,966
And for UX,

224
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:43,299
it's like what's the experience here?

225
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,532
Is it a great learning experience?

226
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:45,466
Is it a fun experience?

227
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:46,632
Is it motivating?

228
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:47,732
Do they wanna play it more?

229
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:50,332
They don’t care if it has centers, or digital.

230
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,332
Either they are in it or not.

231
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,266
Right. So, you're teaching at Shenkar

232
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:54,566
in Tel Aviv University.

233
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,532
And what do you focusing on?

234
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:58,832
And what do entrepreneurs

235
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,066
today who are building products

236
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:02,332
that are going to be used by kids

237
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,399
or other demographics?

238
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,666
Is this something that they need to

239
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,266
keep in mind and really understand

240
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:08,032
the different user experiences?

241
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:09,932
Is there a really clear distinction?

242
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:12,499
Yeah. I think that's two different things.

243
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,599
I think students at Tel Aviv University

244
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,232
and Shenkar, they're very interested in this.

245
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:19,266
They see what's happening around them.

246
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,599
And they can tell the difference.

247
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,699
They don't really know

248
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,232
how to engage at it exactly.

249
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:24,932
You notice people are into Minecraft.

250
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:25,666
There's Fortnite.

251
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:26,799
These days there's Tiktok.

252
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,032
Or Snapchat. Like, what's going on?

253
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:31,099
And it's fine. It's exciting.

254
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,566
But I think, the important thing for an

255
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:34,566
entrepreneur is really to understand

256
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:36,966
that there's a variety of kids.

257
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:38,299
I've worked in so many companies

258
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:38,866
that come and say,

259
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:42,566
"My kids, they love reading on an iPad."

260
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:44,266
So, blah blah blah blah blah

261
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:44,866
I'm just, "Okay."

262
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:46,432
Let's see what their age really.

263
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:47,266
Do you know how many kids

264
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:48,832
with developmentally appropriate?

265
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,866
So that all these myths that we really

266
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:52,832
have to de-use user research too.

267
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,332
But like with any other UX

268
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,432
and any other product,

269
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:56,866
to tease them apart.

270
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:57,766
there are a lot of myths

271
00:09:57,767 --> 00:09:58,666
about kids and technology.

272
00:09:58,667 --> 00:09:59,999
And unfortunately,

273
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,299
the biggest one is screen time.

274
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,299
Everybody is afraid of screen time.

275
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,999
Especially in the valley.

276
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,566
And I think it's really interesting because

277
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,399
there is no such thing as screen time.

278
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,499
If you look at,

279
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,499
I gave my kids 20 minutes

280
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,299
of screen time today.

281
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,066
What does that mean?

282
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:18,232
That they are watching 20 minutes

283
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:19,266
of Sesame Street?

284
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:21,499
National Geographic? Or porn?

285
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,099
Were they watching reality TV?

286
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,599
Or sports? Was it Dora?

287
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,666
What does that even mean?

288
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:28,899
It's like you would never,

289
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,866
you know in a book or any other game.

290
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:32,299
It's about the content.

291
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,366
And then the context.

292
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:34,299
What are the alternatives?

293
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,932
Now, 20 minutes of screen time

294
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:37,432
can mean talking to grandma.

295
00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:39,399
Because you can’t go and visit her.

296
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,199
Is that being bad?

297
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,966
Right.

298
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:44,599
So, it's really about the content.

299
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,632
The context, and the alternative. Right?

300
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:49,532
And also the specific child.

301
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:50,732
What's the age group?

302
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,466
What are their capabilities?

303
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:54,666
What do they need in their lives?

304
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:58,599
So, I think by boxing in on the screen time,

305
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,632
We're really doing a disservice for our kids.

306
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:04,432
And also, were not looking at ourselves.

307
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:07,166
Because as the adult around the kid,

308
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,499
we're on this thing all the time.

309
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,899
Not 20 minutes. Not 20 hours.

310
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,699
But 24 hours 24/7.

311
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,332
There's so many service to show that

312
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,432
So, these kids are growing up

313
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:22,699
in a very different childhood.

314
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,432
than you grew up.

315
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,032
And that I grew up in for sure.

316
00:11:25,033 --> 00:11:26,432
Where everybody is connected

317
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:27,066
all the time.

318
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:28,066
They wanna be like the adults

319
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:28,766
around them.

320
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:31,899
So, it's not fair to judge them and say

321
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,032
"Oh, when I was a kid,

322
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:34,632
we use to play outside all the time."

323
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:37,266
Right. Because you didn’t have this

324
00:11:37,267 --> 00:11:39,599
super computer library in your pocket

325
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,199
all the time and neither did your parents.

326
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,599
or your siblings, or your friends,

327
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,299
and everybody else.

328
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,032
Very different childhood especially 2020.

329
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:52,232
This acceleration is amazing. Right.

330
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:53,466
I mean amazing in the sense

331
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:54,832
that it's remarkable. I don't know if its

332
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,199
I don’t know what's going to be on kids

333
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,366
But one of the things that

334
00:11:58,367 --> 00:11:58,932
I’m curious about,

335
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:01,132
So, we talked about this trend that

336
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:03,866
kids are much more into experimentation

337
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:06,332
and as the generations grow older,

338
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:09,432
the will or the excitement

339
00:12:09,433 --> 00:12:11,232
about experimentation decreases or

340
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:13,132
there's an increase in anxiety or fear.

341
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:15,666
Are there other key differences

342
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:16,666
that you've noticed

343
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:18,799
between the usage of kids

344
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,466
versus the usage of adults?

345
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:23,366
And some things that product designers

346
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,999
or entrepreneurs can keep in mind

347
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,832
as they're designing their products

348
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,132
for the different demographics?

349
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:30,566
Yes. Definitely.

350
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:31,832
So, number one I think

351
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,199
the most important one is motivation.

352
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,132
So, when you're designing a product

353
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:35,766
for adult,

354
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:37,132
your motivations are a lot of times.

355
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:38,866
you totally you wanna be efficient,

356
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:40,999
you want to get in the time on task.

357
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,532
Just to measure,

358
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:44,932
you check your ROI according to

359
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:46,199
how much time you saving,

360
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,332
how much money you're saving

361
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,766
With kids, it's not just the case.

362
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:51,299
Again, it depends on the age group,

363
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,699
the content and the context.

364
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,599
But a lot of times, kids are using

365
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,299
technology for fun, for entertainment

366
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:57,932
for learning.

367
00:12:57,933 --> 00:12:59,932
They will spend an hour watching

368
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:02,266
something that you think is not a value

369
00:13:02,267 --> 00:13:03,799
but for them it's huge.

370
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,232
And if you really wanna empower them,

371
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:08,132
and give them the ability to create

372
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:10,232
like drawings, like they're drawing a data

373
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:13,266
if they're creating stop-motion animation

374
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:15,899
or they're creating video games.

375
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,766
That they're programming.

376
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:18,066
That will take hours.

377
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:20,099
So, it's not about efficiency

378
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,199
which is very important.

379
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,099
It's a very different thing

380
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,432
when you're doing UX for adults.

381
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:24,699
Efficiency is a very big thing.

382
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,932
So, motivations, intrinsic motivations,

383
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,099
things that I'm passionate about.

384
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,432
While adults a lot of times have

385
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:33,199
external motivations. Things for work.

386
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,199
It changes the ability.

387
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,099
There's a modification a few years ago

388
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,532
things that's going down a bit

389
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:40,832
because people don’t understand that

390
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,966
once you are doing things for badges and

391
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:44,366
leaderboards and stars.

392
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:46,799
That becomes the motivation and

393
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,666
you'll forget about

394
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:49,366
what you're actually loving to do.

395
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:52,466
So, even in places like Khan academy

396
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:54,132
and places that have really

397
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,099
kind of noble way to treat education

398
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,099
or doing great things.

399
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,499
They've lowered the gamification of it.

400
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,399
So, the focus is still the content.

401
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,632
So, gamification works.

402
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:08,199
No doubt about it. It works.

403
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,132
It just changes the focus

404
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:11,699
from the content.

405
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,532
for different people

406
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:14,332
who does different things.

407
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,966
Interesting. But I'd love to say that

408
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:18,432
I was looking for motivation to finish

409
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:19,666
the course on Khan Academy all back

410
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:21,099
when I was in high school.

411
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,566
And I was doing self-study

412
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:23,432
for advance math.

413
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:25,399
And decide that I had those badges.

414
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,866
And I had that streak.

415
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,732
All of sudden it kept me from

416
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:30,532
exiting a video because I knew that if

417
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:32,099
I just listen to the last two minutes

418
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,932
which are always important because

419
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:34,532
that's where you usually

420
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:35,232
have the summary

421
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:36,632
but we think,

422
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:37,832
every kid thinks

423
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:38,899
he's the smartest kid in the world.

424
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,132
So, I think I don’t need to listen

425
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:41,166
to this summary. I got it.

426
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:43,566
But I wouldn’t have received my

427
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:45,632
extra 90 tokens if I didn’t stay on.

428
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:47,799
So, I stayed on and I'm very thankful

429
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,399
that I did that.

430
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,199
Shuli, talk to me a little bit

431
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,732
about your work.

432
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:52,066
What does it mean to be

433
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:54,732
an expert on user experience for kids?

434
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:56,232
Do you work with startups?

435
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:57,832
Do you teach? How does it work?

436
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:02,232
Okay. So, I'm a few different bits

437
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:02,766
to my work.

438
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:03,899
I'm very into disciplinarian.

439
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,266
I’ve got one feet in academia

440
00:15:05,267 --> 00:15:06,099
one feet in the industry.

441
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,299
I don’t really fit anywhere.

442
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,266
But I really enjoy it.

443
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:09,499
Because I love theory.

444
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,799
And I love research.

445
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,732
And I love thinking about products

446
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:13,999
that just benefit kids.

447
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,932
And without have to thinking

448
00:15:14,933 --> 00:15:16,132
about marketing sales

449
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:16,932
and all of that stuff.

450
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:19,332
However, I like doing things

451
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,166
in the real world.

452
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:21,432
I would actually teach kids too.

453
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:23,199
So, trying to do both.

454
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,399
I consult companies who develop

455
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:26,932
products for kids.

456
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:28,732
This could be AR, VR.

457
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:31,966
And apps like digital TV apps.

458
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:33,299
And now I'm working with the company

459
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,666
that's building an online platform

460
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,499
for education.

461
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,099
So, when they are doing

462
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,266
these products we the folio X process.

463
00:15:39,267 --> 00:15:41,466
So, we think about who are stakeholders?

464
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:42,166
Who are the users?

465
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:43,866
Where are they pinpointing the lights

466
00:15:43,867 --> 00:15:44,299
the journey.

467
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,766
But we do add the unique factors

468
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:48,966
of designing for kids and for families.

469
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:51,266
Which go together with designing

470
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:51,866
for children’s rights.

471
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,232
Which is another organization

472
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:55,166
I'm a part of. And I'm thinking about

473
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:57,066
what this affords them?

474
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:58,766
What this really gives them?

475
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:00,466
More than only what they need.

476
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:03,266
Because need is again, it's very adult word.

477
00:16:03,267 --> 00:16:05,299
are main point

478
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,432
that means you have a goal

479
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,032
and you have an efficiency and so forth.

480
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,132
And there are also

481
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:10,499
some legal considerations

482
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,632
for us to consider

483
00:16:11,633 --> 00:16:14,332
data, privacy, security.

484
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,399
when you're designing for kids.

485
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,666
Which are slightly different.

486
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:17,699
Again, depending on the

487
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,032
different age groups.

488
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:21,966
When you said the word children’s rights

489
00:16:21,967 --> 00:16:23,299
then immediately my thought was,

490
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,299
how do you design responsibly for kids?

491
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,966
not just in terms of the legal aspect

492
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:27,932
on the data and privacy.

493
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:29,866
But also in terms of,

494
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:31,532
it's much easier I think to,

495
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,699
I'm assuming to get a kid addicted to

496
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,432
something than it is

497
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:35,299
to get an adult addicted.

498
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,899
Because the adult has those firewalls.

499
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,166
Those internal firewalls that tell them,

500
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,099
I'm actually spending too much time here

501
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,599
or I'm not doing the right thing.

502
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,999
A kid may not have that.

503
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,999
So, what is responsibility here

504
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,132
in terms of understanding

505
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,299
how to design responsibly for kids?

506
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,699
So, ethics are big.

507
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,732
So, you hit the point.

508
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:56,666
Adult have that or not.

509
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:57,766
But we can’t. They're adults.

510
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,532
They can do whatever they want.

511
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:00,999
We do have legal protection.

512
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,966
For different things.

513
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:03,066
from gamblings to other things.

514
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:04,699
But we know that there are way

515
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,099
to introduce dark UX

516
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,232
to create addictions and so forth.

517
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:09,766
Now, for kids that's worst.

518
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:11,999
I like that term. Dark UX.

519
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,166
Dark UX. There you go.

520
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,666
Look it up. You'll find creepy stuff.

521
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:20,532
But for kids, especially in my kids,

522
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:21,232
they don’t even know

523
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:22,199
that some things are odds.

524
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,932
I have this conversation with my son

525
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:24,666
a few years ago.

526
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:26,166
When one of his favorite youtubers

527
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:27,699
was showing in some thing

528
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,232
with Lego or Minecrafter.

529
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:30,266
And then I told him,

530
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:31,599
"Well you know he get paid for that."

531
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,066
He looked at me and said,

532
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:33,999
"What?"

533
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,632
And I said, "Yeah."

534
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:35,732
"You know they're promoting."

535
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:36,266
And I said,

536
00:17:36,267 --> 00:17:37,399
"You know I like this youtuber."

537
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,832
"I really do. He's awesome."

538
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,332
"He picks really good products."

539
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,799
"I like the way he dress up."

540
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,799
"That's why I let you watch him."

541
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,199
"But you should know that Lego

542
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,732
paid him to go to Legoland

543
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:47,532
to get the stuff."

544
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,432
He started crying and he's like,

545
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:50,732
"How can you say that?"

546
00:17:50,733 --> 00:17:52,832
"This is just what he love."

547
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,166
So, we have now,

548
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:55,699
of course, my kids,

549
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,199
they're involve in my career.

550
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,532
So, they know what’s going on.

551
00:17:58,533 --> 00:17:59,932
But a lot of kids don’t.

552
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:01,899
They believe that these influencers

553
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,066
are passionate about their stuff.

554
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:05,466
Now, some of the stuff that

555
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:06,866
youtubers pull are awesome.

556
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:08,666
A lot of environmental stuff,

557
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,166
A lot of great stuff.

558
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:11,799
But they are promoters

559
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,299
of all kinds of efforts

560
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,399
And there's no way,

561
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,666
In TV, in linear TV there used to be

562
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,432
We'll be back after these messages.

563
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:19,866
Right? When we were watching a show

564
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:21,032
And you were going to commercials.

565
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,299
That was a way to tell children

566
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,132
Okay, the cartoons you're seeing now

567
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:25,932
are ads.

568
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:27,932
The cartoons you saw before are content.

569
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:29,366
That's how they distinguish it.

570
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:30,499
So, they have the same characters.

571
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,332
Spiderman’s here and spiderman there.

572
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,732
It’s the same.

573
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,232
In internet, in digital,

574
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:36,299
we don’t have that linear

575
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,732
So, we have to be very responsible.

576
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:40,299
There a lot going on in terms of ads

577
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,099
and kids’ apps, and page stuff

578
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,932
and different models for it.

579
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:46,432
But yeah, you have to be aware

580
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:47,732
of these things and think about it.

581
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:49,499
and think about what kind of experience

582
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,699
you want to create for your users.

583
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,099
Ethically not only legally.

584
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,899
I think two things came to mind

585
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,099
when you were giving that example

586
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,132
of my beautiful niece

587
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:58,299
whose now five years old.

588
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,866
But this is already relevant

589
00:18:59,867 --> 00:19:00,766
from when she was three.

590
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:01,666
That she would watch these

591
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:03,432
unboxing videos on YouTube

592
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,566
And when I saw that,

593
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:05,166
I thought it was the

594
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:05,766
most ridiculous thing.

595
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:07,299
I couldn’t believe that we're watching

596
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,999
another kid unbox a toy now.

597
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,966
And then I looked at how many

598
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:12,866
viewers in it. It had a billion views.

599
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:14,199
It was one of the most

600
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,366
popular videos on YouTube.

601
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:17,932
And then every time,

602
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:21,199
On YouTube there was the ads

603
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,399
that come up in the middle.

604
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,599
She would go furious.

605
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,332
She was yelling, "I don’t understand."

606
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,932
"How do I exit out of this?"

607
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,032
"How do I skip?"

608
00:19:29,033 --> 00:19:31,099
And I thought it was just incredible.

609
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,899
Because I grew up,

610
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,999
In Saturday morning I go to the TV,

611
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,099
And I watch my cartoons

612
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,399
And I wait. And I wait for the cartoons

613
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,966
And whatever happens, happens.

614
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:41,399
Right. But that's a great point.

615
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,999
Because first of all the cartoon,

616
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,232
they don’t get the whole

617
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:45,632
why do we have to wait?

618
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:46,566
And why do we have to watch?

619
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:47,866
But the adults don’t get it either.

620
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:49,166
So, they're good.

621
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:50,532
They're get along and everything.

622
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:53,332
But the thing about the unboxing

623
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,866
and there's a lot written about that

624
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:55,666
and it's really cool.

625
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:57,166
So, if you think about clay patterns.

626
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:59,299
Clay patterns don’t change across media.

627
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,966
But if you think about peek-a-boo. Right?

628
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,566
It's the same thing. It's unboxing.

629
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:06,132
So, you just walk in, "Wow. Surprise."

630
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:07,066
And then another one.

631
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:09,099
"Wow. I wonder what's gonna be

632
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,299
in there now. So, it's so exciting."

633
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,266
We call it unboxing because

634
00:20:13,267 --> 00:20:15,366
we have no clue what's going on there.

635
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:17,799
But for them it's just a surprise show.

636
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,499
After surprise. After surprise.

637
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,199
Which is really cool.

638
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,566
You know how when kids get gifts?

639
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:22,366
They save that.

640
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:23,499
The box parts is the best part.

641
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,499
They play the cardboard.

642
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,066
That's it. Over and over again.

643
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:28,866
It's amazing.

644
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:30,066
Wow. Perfect.

645
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:31,332
That is so so cool.

646
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,499
Are there different things

647
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,799
that we should be worried about?

648
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,999
with the way that generations are moving

649
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,566
and interacting with technology.

650
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:40,699
Should I be worried about

651
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,966
some of the things that my niece

652
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:44,199
is going to experience different

653
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,199
from the way I will

654
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,999
whether in terms of social interactions,

655
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,199
or personal fulfillment.

656
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,699
or emotional intelligence.

657
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,932
Oh yeah. But it's hard to say what.

658
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:57,199
So, I think the problem with that is that

659
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,832
a lot of parents today

660
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,666
don’t know what their kids are doing.

661
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:02,466
They can’t deal with it.

662
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:04,266
Parenting is hard. You're a parent.

663
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:06,266
Your kids are doing stuff you haven’t

664
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:07,099
done when you were a kid.

665
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,199
They're not watching Saturday

666
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,166
morning cartoons anymore.

667
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,199
Maybe they are but they are doing

668
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,366
definitely another thing.

669
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:13,499
And so, you have to learn

670
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,499
what they are doing.

671
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,532
What's right and wrong.

672
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:16,532
What's going on.

673
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:18,332
And it's really really difficult.

674
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,499
So, why are parents obsessed?

675
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,366
Do whatever you need to do.

676
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:22,432
Let me know if I have to buy something.

677
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:24,732
And that's the big problem now.

678
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:26,066
Because you would never let your kid

679
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:27,032
just go around the street

680
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:28,432
and go to people you don’t know.

681
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:30,866
And there could be things that are not

682
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:31,999
for them are dangerous.

683
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,832
Or even if you let them play like

684
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,932
I have a mom I talk about Fortnite and

685
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:37,099
how I thought it was actually

686
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,732
a pretty cool game for tweens.

687
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:40,532
And she was so angry and she said

688
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:42,966
"You know my kid you should see him."

689
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:44,599
"He plays eight hours of Fortnite."

690
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,499
"He's like a zombie."

691
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:45,966
And I'm like,

692
00:21:45,967 --> 00:21:47,966
Why is he playing eight hours of Fortnite?

693
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:51,132
One hour. Two hours.

694
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:52,899
With his friends that's awesome.

695
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,532
It's a game that has diversity.

696
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:55,299
You play with groups.

697
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,266
you're assigned gender, ethnicity,

698
00:21:57,267 --> 00:22:00,499
random. There's no blood.

699
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,066
There's sweet little cute animals.

700
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:02,932
There's dances.

701
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:06,599
Eight hours? Like eight hours?

702
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,032
So, and I think,

703
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:09,366
Because she's like, Ah, yes.

704
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:11,232
He's playing with his friends.

705
00:22:11,233 --> 00:22:13,032
So, I think the problem for the kid

706
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:14,799
is not the technology per se.

707
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,899
But the problem with the parents

708
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,099
are kind of stuck. They don’t know.

709
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,266
They don’t know enough about

710
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:20,132
when to say yes, when to say no.

711
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:20,932
They have to sit down

712
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:22,266
and play with their kids.

713
00:22:22,267 --> 00:22:24,432
They have to know what Fortnite really is.

714
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:25,732
What Minecraft really is.

715
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:28,166
And then they’ll know how to parent it.

716
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:29,366
Like what they do with anything else.

717
00:22:29,367 --> 00:22:30,366
There’s no other way.

718
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:31,366
Because it keeps changing.

719
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:33,866
Its like you said about Tiktok.

720
00:22:33,867 --> 00:22:35,666
Today is Tiktok.

721
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,199
Three years ago is Snapchat.

722
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,499
Two years ago something else.

723
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,532
It's gonna be something else soon.

724
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:41,432
Because too many adults are in Tiktok.

725
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:42,366
The teens are gonna leave.

726
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:43,932
They don’t want those there.

727
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:45,732
Really, adults are going to Tiktok?

728
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:48,932
Oh yeah. All these moms are trying

729
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:49,866
to be cool.

730
00:22:49,867 --> 00:22:51,266
And all these companies are trying to

731
00:22:51,267 --> 00:22:52,299
use Tiktok as a platform

732
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,899
for products of course.

733
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,299
So, the minute that happened,

734
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,699
You know it's gonna shift soon

735
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,566
in some way.

736
00:22:58,567 --> 00:22:59,866
But the thing is that,

737
00:22:59,867 --> 00:23:01,399
parents to know.

738
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,732
So, my advice would be

739
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:03,799
just sit down and play.

740
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,132
Don’t read articles whatever.

741
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,332
Just sit down and play with your kids.

742
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:08,566
Just see what's going on.

743
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:09,199
What do they do.

744
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,499
They'll love.

745
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,299
They wanna talk to you about these things.

746
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,299
Fascinating.

747
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,732
And if there’s a point where they don’t.

748
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:15,532
Where they’re teens already.

749
00:23:15,533 --> 00:23:19,832
That's difficult. But still be there with them.

750
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:20,899
Just show them you care.

751
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,066
Show them that you're into that.

752
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,532
Just don’t dismiss it all as screen time.

753
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:26,732
Oh c'mon, I don’t understand about that.

754
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:29,766
Then you're just creating a bigger gap.

755
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:31,066
And its harder to parent them.

756
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:32,999
100%. Shuli, 20 minutes go by

757
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,899
so so fast. But I have to ask you the most

758
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,932
important question. Three words that

759
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:37,699
best describe you.

760
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,799
Okay. One I guess it would be

761
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,632
Interdisciplinary. Because I don’t know

762
00:23:43,633 --> 00:23:44,432
what I do.

763
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:46,932
The other one would be Curious.

764
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:49,066
I'm always interested in what’s going on.

765
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:50,566
And the last one would be an Optimist.

766
00:23:50,567 --> 00:23:53,299
Because I really believe it's all good.

767
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,566
Wow. Most people when they talk

768
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,799
about this the way the kids are

769
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,732
interacting with technology

770
00:23:58,733 --> 00:23:59,932
and the addiction, they're very,

771
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:02,166
they're on the opposite spectrum

772
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:03,366
of optimism.

773
00:24:03,367 --> 00:24:04,832
because they haven’t talk to kids.

774
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,932
That's what I love about what I do.

775
00:24:06,933 --> 00:24:08,366
I get to sit and talk to them,

776
00:24:08,367 --> 00:24:08,866
and play with them,

777
00:24:08,867 --> 00:24:09,566
and they’re the best.

778
00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:11,766
That's amazing. Shuli, toda raba.

779
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:12,966
Thank you very very much.

780
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:14,899
Toda. Stay safe and stay healthy.

781
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:43,467
Thanks. Bye. Take care.
