1
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,240
All right.

2
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,120
Kiwoba Allaire, thank you so much

3
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,440
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

4
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,080
How are you?

5
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm very excited to be here.

6
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,040
Thank you for having me.

7
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,680
Quite honored.

8
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,040
This is going to be a wonderful journey

9
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,880
that you'll take me through

10
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,040
over these next 20 minutes.

11
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,600
I'm excited to hear

12
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,920
about your personal journey.

13
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,360
I'm very excited to hear about

14
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,080
the organization that you've founded

15
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,880
and just the whole process

16
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,320
of both being a tech executive

17
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,600
but also owning this organization

18
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,440
and being so passionate

19
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,120
about empowering the missions

20
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,720
that you're off to.

21
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,960
So, I don't want to give too much away.

22
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,360
Please take it away.

23
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,200
GIRL STEM STARS, tell me about this.

24
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,680
Oh, sure.

25
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,760
Thank you so much again for having me.

26
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,240
My name is Kiwoba Allaire.

27
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,880
I am the CEO and founder

28
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,320
of GIRL STEM STARS.

29
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,080
We advance girls of color

30
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,600
from underrepresented communities in STEM,

31
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,000
science, technology, engineering and math.

32
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,240
A lot of people ask me,

33
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,560
"Why did you start GIRL STEM STARS?"

34
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,280
the whole entrepreneurial story.

35
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,760
And it's actually very organic.

36
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,880
I started doing this type of work

37
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,440
at a tech company years ago

38
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,720
where I was bringing in girls of color

39
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,680
every Wednesday.

40
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,400
We had about a busload of 50 girls

41
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:38,960
that would come in,

42
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,520
and each department in the tech company

43
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,960
would teach the girls something,

44
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,080
and then we'd bus them back.

45
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,240
From there, I noticed that

46
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,880
we didn't have a lot of black girls.

47
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,800
We had Latina, we had Pan-Asian,

48
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,280
we had a lot of girls,

49
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,440
but I maybe had one or two black girls.

50
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:02,240
And so, as things happen, I wound up

51
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,040
having a near-death experience.

52
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,800
And in 2013, I was supposed to have

53
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,640
a routine surgery

54
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,600
that actually went sideways.

55
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,280
I wound up septic all over my body.

56
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,000
It particularly hit my heart,

57
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
my lungs, my kidneys,

58
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,800
and what else, my heart, my lungs,

59
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,680
my kidneys and something else,

60
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,600
but at the end of the day,

61
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,120
I was in a coma for three weeks.

62
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,400
And it's interesting,

63
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,580
my doctors tell me that-

64
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,600
Three weeks?

65
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,640
Yes.

66
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,840
Yes.

67
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,640
So, when I came out of that coma,

68
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,880
I had no idea what happened.

69
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,280
I thought I got hit by a car.

70
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,720
I had no idea what happened.

71
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,000
And my family had to explain to me

72
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,600
that I was very sick

73
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,800
and that I nearly died.

74
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,480
My doctor said I was

75
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,680
five minutes from death three times.

76
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,280
And long story short,

77
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,480
it was a long recovery,

78
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,040
but my Auntie ...

79
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,680
came to my recovery bed and she said,

80
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,280
"Girl, do you realize that God sent

81
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,440
his ... and ministering angels

82
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,760
to fight for you and to keep you?

83
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,000
And it's not just because you have,
it's not just to continue working

84
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,280
at that tech company,

85
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,920
you have a greater purpose on your life."

86
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,760
And I realized,

87
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,880
let me pray about this,

88
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,640
let me think about this,

89
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,840
but at the end of the day,

90
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,200
I started to think what bugs me?

91
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,960
What am I not happy about

92
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,160
in this world?

93
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,560
And I remember I used to

94
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,840
complain and whine to recruiters

95
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,280
and HR people saying,

96
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,040
"Hey, Susie with the blond hair

97
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,760
and the blue eyes, hire more people

98
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,600
that look like me."

99
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,920
Because I was the only person

100
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,360
that looked like me at most tech companies

101
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
that I worked at.

102
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,840
I didn't get to see anybody

103
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,440
that looked like myself on a daily basis,

104
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,040
and that can tend to bug you

105
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,920
after a while.

106
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,960
So yeah, I realized okay,

107
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,760
stop whining and complaining,

108
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,640
let's be the change that I wanted to see.

109
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,960
Wait wait, just before we get to this change,

110
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,880
because I don't get to meet many people

111
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,000
who have gone through

112
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,240
such an extraordinary experience,

113
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,280
a horrible experience,

114
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,840
but extraordinary nevertheless,

115
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,520
of being in a coma for three weeks,

116
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,400
waking up.

117
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,080
Give me a little bit of context as to,

118
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,880
and paint me a picture

119
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,200
of what's happening there.

120
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,920
So, you wake up.

121
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,720
You're in the tech world.

122
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,600
There are things that bother you,

123
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,840
and you're going to have all this passion

124
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,280
and ambition to change those things,

125
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,320
but what do you feel?

126
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,520
Are you confused?

127
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,880
Do you understand what was happening?

128
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,000
Who was next to you?

129
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,480
Paint me that picture,

130
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,160
because I think it's fascinating.

131
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,360
So, I'm really blessed.

132
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,640
My husband, when I came out of it,

133
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,400
the nurses told me,

134
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,360
"Your husband was like a lion

135
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,400
at the front of your bed."

136
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:51,920
I'm like,

137
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,680
"My husband?"

138
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,200
Because he's actually usually

139
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,040
quite mild mannered,

140
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,920
and I was very surprised that they said

141
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,680
he was really fighting for me.

142
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,240
I mean of course

143
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,120
I knew he'd fight for me,

144
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,600
but not in the physical way

145
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,440
that they had expressed.

146
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,520
And when he, I guess,

147
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,160
he asked for permission

148
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,640
to put speakers in the ICU

149
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,520
so that he could play my favorite music,

150
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,960
which is bossa nova, Sergio Mendez.

151
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,160
And so when, during the coma

152
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,440
I could hear the music,

153
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,400
which is interesting.

154
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,800
People say,

155
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,720
"Can you hear anything during the coma?"

156
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,280
Yes, you can. At least I did.

157
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,440
I could hear the music.

158
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,120
Really? You remember hearing the music?

159
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,680
I knew I was in a safe place

160
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,320
'cause it's my music.

161
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,520
Nobody else that I know

162
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,520
listens to that music.

163
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,400
So, when I heard that music,

164
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,280
I knew that I was in a safe place.

165
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,720
But coming out of the coma,

166
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,560
it's like coming out of a cloud.

167
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,200
And I won't get into like

168
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,640
what I thought happened in there,

169
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,840
but it's like coming out

170
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,360
of a big puffy cloud,

171
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,400
and everything's kind of muted

172
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,840
but it's starting to come,

173
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,040
everything's starting to come awake.

174
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,920
And then you hear people talking

175
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,040
and people are encouraging you.

176
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,000
I remember hearing a nurse telling me,

177
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,720
"Come on, you can't die.

178
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,920
You have a lot to live for."

179
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,960
I remember her rubbing my arm.

180
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,960
I remember her rubbing my arm.

181
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,640
I could tell the people

182
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,800
that came into the room

183
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,760
that cared about me.

184
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,400
I knew that if my family was there,

185
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,320
I didn't know who they were,

186
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,440
but I just felt a warm entity

187
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,720
that I knew I was safe

188
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,240
and that person cared about me

189
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,960
as opposed to the brush of a white jacket.

190
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,880
You hear a clicking of the board

191
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,240
where your medical stuff is on.

192
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,680
And then click it goes back down,

193
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,200
and they're gone.

194
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,280
It was like a cold breeze

195
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,680
that went through, right?

196
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,800
So, coming out of that,

197
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,520
I had no idea what happened.

198
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,080
What I was told is

199
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,040
I came out of the surgery, and I was fine.

200
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,520
I went home. Doctor said,

201
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,920
"You're up in two weeks."

202
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,920
And inevitably I wasn't.

203
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,720
And I passed out in our home.

204
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,040
So, my husband raced me

205
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,000
to the emergency room, and they told him

206
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,240
that my white blood cell count

207
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,560
was off the charts and to call family.

208
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,000
And so, he called all of the family.

209
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,240
I do remember hearing murmurs of them

210
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,720
talking, saying they love me,

211
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,800
that they're praying for me,

212
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,440
but I don't remember anything after that.

213
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,320
Supposedly, I was in recovery

214
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,360
for two weeks

215
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,960
after they did another surgery,

216
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,440
and I just started to crash.

217
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,360
I guess they said

218
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
I was talking to a nurse,

219
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,280
and then all of a sudden

220
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,200
the blue light goes on, and I crashed

221
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,840
and they had to revive me.

222
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,000
And they called my husband and said,

223
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,600
"We've induced your wife into a coma

224
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,680
so that she doesn't die,

225
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,520
and we don't know what's wrong with her."

226
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,000
So, at that point, my husband had to call

227
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,200
the CEO of the tech company

228
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,800
I was working with and say,

229
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,680
"Yeah, I don't think Kiwoba's

230
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,800
coming back."

231
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,000
And interestingly enough,

232
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,360
that CEO happened to know people

233
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,680
on the board of the hospital

234
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,640
that I was at.

235
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,320
And my husband, he said,

236
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,440
"Let me call some people"

237
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,520
and he wound up helping out.

238
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,200
And my husband said

239
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,640
there was a guy from Stanford

240
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,280
in the room,

241
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,320
there was four heads of surgeries

242
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,560
and head of this department of pulmonary.

243
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,000
And after a while,

244
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,840
they finally figured out

245
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,880
what was wrong with me

246
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,000
and proceeded to, he said like

247
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,840
10 IV poles showed up in the room,

248
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,240
and they all seemed to know

249
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,440
what was going on now

250
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,520
and they knew what to do

251
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,960
to get me better.

252
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,240
But he was told it was still

253
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,720
a 50-50 chance that I would survive.

254
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,360
Wow.

255
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,760
Right.

256
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,560
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

257
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,160
So, you come out

258
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,320
of this crazy experience,

259
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,360
and you're taking the passion

260
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,440
that you had before, now, it sounds like,

261
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,400
with a deeper purpose and meaning

262
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,760
to what you can and should be doing

263
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,480
with your time.

264
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,080
And while you were doing

265
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,240
extraordinary things in your job,

266
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,480
and you still are, you chose to now devote

267
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,800
another portion of your time

268
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,000
to this new project.

269
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,760
Tell me about GIRL STEM STARS.

270
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,360
So, as I mentioned,

271
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,520
I was in my recovery bed

272
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,600
when I came to that enlightenment of

273
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,200
okay, stop whining and complaining,

274
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,120
be the change that you wanted to see.

275
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,680
And so, I literally called up,

276
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,040
I picked up the phone

277
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,120
from my recovery bed,

278
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,740
and I called LegalZoom and said,

279
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,200
"I want to start a non-profit

280
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,120
that advances black girls

281
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,960
and girls of color

282
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,600
from underserved communities in STEM."

283
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,760
And it started to roll out from there,

284
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,800
started doing the 501(c)3.

285
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,800
But I found that I came to,

286
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,960
like I was crawling up a hill,

287
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,000
but I just got stuck.

288
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,880
And I was talking to one of my friends

289
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,480
who's on the council of East Palo Alto,

290
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,640
and he's like,

291
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,680
"How are you doing?"

292
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,880
And I burst into tears, and he's like,

293
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,960
"What's going on?"

294
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,680
And I said,

295
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,560
"I've been trying to do

296
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,480
this 501(c)3."

297
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,160
He goes,

298
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,920
"Girl, you're trying to do a 501(c)3

299
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,120
while you're in recovery in bed?"

300
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,040
He says, "What are you crazy?"

301
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,040
So, he says,

302
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,240
"You need to speak up."

303
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,520
And that was one enlightment right there:

304
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,800
don't carry it all yourself,

305
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,880
you need help.

306
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,280
Every leader needs help.

307
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,640
And so, he put out the word

308
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,440
and found a lawyer that was interested

309
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,120
in the work that we were doing,

310
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,480
and I actually crawled out

311
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,800
of my recovery bed to go meet him.

312
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,840
And he's like,

313
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,200
"What are you doing here?

314
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,120
I thought we were gonna be

315
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,760
on the phone?"

316
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,080
I'm like,

317
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,600
"Anybody who wants to help me

318
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,520
with this project,

319
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,040
I want to see you face to face."

320
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,920
And at the end of the day,

321
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,720
he took the whole project from me,

322
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,480
paid for it, and worked with the IRS

323
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,360
to do the 501(c)3.

324
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,280
So, I mean, I'm a believer.

325
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,360
So, this is where I say,

326
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,560
"Look at how God works in my life."

327
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,120
Right?

328
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:17,600
And then, we got a lot of recognition

329
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,600
and participation, a lot of volunteers.

330
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,000
I gathered all the girls,

331
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
and we started doing events

332
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,160
at tech companies.

333
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,560
So, we would take a group of girls,

334
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,760
say a hundred girls over to Google.

335
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,600
And they would have a whole day.

336
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,040
I know the parents were grateful

337
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,560
that they get to drop off their kid

338
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,120
at 7:30 in the morning.

339
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,160
We feed them breakfast,

340
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,760
we give them goodie bags,

341
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,640
t-shirts, you name it,

342
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,440
and then we're teaching them,

343
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,480
we expose them to amazing mentors

344
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,440
like black women astronauts

345
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,760
and the VP of YouTube

346
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,920
who is a black woman.

347
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,120
The girls freaked out. They're like,

348
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,760
"You're the boss of Youtube?"

349
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,200
And she's like,

350
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,560
"Yes, I am."

351
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,040
And they're like,

352
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,720
"Oh, I want to be like her."

353
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,120
Boom, we automatically have

354
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,640
that child's attention,

355
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,200
and that girl wants to be,

356
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,040
'cause I usually ask them,

357
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,800
"Who do you want to be like

358
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,640
when you grow up?"

359
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:12,880
They're like,

360
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,000
"Oh, I want to be like Beyonce."

361
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,040
And,

362
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,560
or "I want to be a veterinarian

363
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,680
so I could take care of puppies.

364
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,160
or "I wanna be a dancer."

365
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,160
But at the end of the day,

366
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,080
when they get to meet

367
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,560
a woman like this,

368
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,560
the vice president of YouTube,

369
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,000
which they all relate to,

370
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,600
or they get to meet

371
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,280
a black female rocket scientist from NASA

372
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,040
who has braids just like them.

373
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,880
I remember she came up and she said,

374
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,280
"Guess how much I make?"

375
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:37,720
And they're like,

376
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,200
"I don't know, $5,000, $10,000."

377
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,720
She goes,

378
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,400
"I make over $200,000."

379
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,880
They're like, "What?

380
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,280
Okay, I want to be like you."

381
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,600
Automatically, after hearing

382
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,560
what this woman does

383
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,480
and how much she makes,

384
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,880
they're instantly attracted to,

385
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,600
if you will, the fame of it.

386
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,960
She's a new she hero for them,

387
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,000
a new STEM hero for them.

388
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,240
STEM hero, I like that.

389
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,320
Yes. Yes.

390
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,600
There's lots of instances where we

391
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,560
take a busload of girls to NASA,

392
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,560
and they get to hang out

393
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,560
with the Black Women Resource Group there

394
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,160
and eat lunch with them,

395
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,680
go sit by their side,

396
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,480
and see what they do on a daily basis.

397
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,320
It blows the girls mind.

398
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,040
Amazing.

399
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,880
Absolutely.

400
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,080
Wow. So, talk to me a little bit

401
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,680
about this impact because, first of all,

402
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,560
I'd like to understand the context

403
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,320
of the problem a little bit bigger,

404
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,440
and through that also

405
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,400
the opportunity for impact.

406
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
So, I'm also coming in

407
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,160
from outside of the country.

408
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,720
And obviously, 2020 has brought up

409
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,120
a lot of different adversities.

410
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,880
One thing that it has clearly brought up

411
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,680
is the issue of minorities

412
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,000
within the United States

413
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,640
and the fight for equality

414
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,920
and for diversification everywhere.

415
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,880
Obviously, with the work that you're doing

416
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,400
with GIRL STEM STARS is incredible,

417
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,400
and I'm sure that it's impacted

418
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,120
so many lives of young women.

419
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,840
Talk to me a little bit

420
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,000
about this greater scope.

421
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,440
So STEM, girls, and minorities,

422
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,840
what is happening today,

423
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,840
and where are you aiming for?

424
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,080
So, it's interesting.

425
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,240
You don't see girls really interested

426
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,720
in math and science and technology,

427
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,720
but when we bring them into a tech company

428
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,840
or at NASA,

429
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,720
but also now that we're, because of covid,

430
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,840
we're doing virtual learning,

431
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,880
the fact that they get to see

432
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,480
a woman on the screen, ask her questions,

433
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,480
how did you get there,

434
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,400
what did you do.

435
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,440
That mentor will show

436
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,280
pictures of themselves as a little girl

437
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,640
so the girls can resonate with them.

438
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,720
Like okay, she was like me at one point.

439
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,640
This is where I believe

440
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,960
all educators need to be starting

441
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,680
very, very young

442
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,200
by getting girls interested in STEM.

443
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,640
And it's super easy to do it in a fun way

444
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,880
where the girls are learning

445
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,120
and they're excited about it,

446
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,600
and they see people,

447
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,360
they see women, that they want to emulate,

448
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,640
that they want to be like.

449
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,360
And then at this point in the game

450
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:15,200
you're building, you can see the ambition where, again,

451
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,040
like the black rocket scientists from NASA,

452
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,520
they have that,

453
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,840
"If I can see it, I can be it."

454
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,280
And this is what we need more of

455
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,320
for minorities to just be exposed

456
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,480
to more STEM and to expose them

457
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,520
to more STEM heroes.

458
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,040
And it's a global thing.

459
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,320
I want to take GIRL STEM STARS global.

460
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,520
My first step is to take it to Africa.

461
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,800
Right now what I do is the videos

462
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,880
that you see online

463
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,480
of like the girls visiting Google

464
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,280
and Microsoft and such,

465
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,120
I share them

466
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,640
with my counterparts in Africa,

467
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,120
and that enables those girls out there

468
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,640
to be able to see, wow, this is what

469
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,080
I have my video guy. I'm like,

470
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,240
"Make it like you're walking in

471
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,080
and you're in it,

472
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,560
like you're in the experience"

473
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,720
so that the girls in Africa

474
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,880
can really feel like

475
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,680
this is what Google looks like,

476
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,800
this is what NASA looks like,

477
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,520
this is what

478
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,920
a black rocket scientist looks like.

479
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,360
There's some STEM heroes.

480
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,760
So, what has been the impact

481
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,440
of GIRL STEM STARS so far?

482
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,000
How many girls

483
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,880
have gone through the program,

484
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,480
and where do you aim it go to

485
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,360
in terms of the scale?

486
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:32,760
Right.

487
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,360
We have touched over a thousand girls.

488
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,960
A thousand? Wow.

489
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,240
Yes, since inception,

490
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,400
over a thousand girls in the Bay Area

491
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,360
and further.

492
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,960
I actually did a STEM camp virtually

493
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,960
for girls in Malaysia.

494
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,200
So, a friend of mine was going out there

495
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,080
to do an educational program

496
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,560
and they said,

497
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,600
"Would you mind doing

498
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,840
GIRL STEM STARS in Malaysia?"

499
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,880
and I'm like, "Sure."

500
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,640
It was amazing to see all the girls

501
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,320
with their headgear

502
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,080
and their little GIRL STEM STARS ...

503
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,520
and they're like, "Hey"

504
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,040
So I definitely, now that we're in this virtual world,

505
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,560
the world is my oyster,

506
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,560
when you think about it,

507
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,200
that I can take GIRL STEM STARS anywhere.

508
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,640
And that's interesting.

509
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,480
So, you're saying that

510
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,200
with acceleration

511
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,520
of the virtual collaboration interaction

512
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,560
due to covid, now, I mean,

513
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,960
'cause you could have done this before, right.

514
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,800
You could have said,

515
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,360
"Okay. I'm going to focus on

516
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,240
primarily virtual gatherings rather than

517
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,520
allocate a lot of time and resources

518
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,040
to going physically"

519
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,320
And it actually makes a lot of sense

520
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,880
that probably for every field trip

521
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,720
that's organized,

522
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,400
you could probably organize

523
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,240
five gatherings virtually, right,

524
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,520
for the same Kiwoba time,

525
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,120
for the same resources.

526
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,840
So it's really fascinating.

527
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,880
So, now you're planning

528
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,960
on taking this global,

529
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,920
allowing interaction, I'm guessing,

530
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,400
also from participants around the world.

531
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,720
And what else needs to happen

532
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,200
in order to level the playing field

533
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,160
or provide not an opportunity for them

534
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,040
to study STEM, because I'm guessing

535
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,880
that a lot of times they do,

536
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,920
but to get their minds curious about it

537
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,920
and to make it socially acceptable

538
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,280
for also minorities, black girls

539
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,320
that you're targeting, to help them

540
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,120
get started in the process?

541
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,000
More awareness needs to be

542
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,800
brought up in media,

543
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,320
because kids are always in media,

544
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,520
social media, and we need more STEM heroes,

545
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,760
and we need STEM to look cool and fun.

546
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,560
Right now, it's for the nerdy group

547
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,600
and it's not, really.

548
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,200
Right. It's not.

549
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,360
I mean, I show videos

550
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,000
of my husband and I scuba diving,

551
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,880
and we're kissing underwater

552
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,480
and the girls are like,

553
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,120
"Oh, that looks like so much fun."

554
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:45,520
And I'm like,

555
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,720
"Do you realize how much STEM

556
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,840
is on my back?

557
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,560
"Do you realize how many

558
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,160
math and science classes I had to take

559
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,960
before they let me jump off that boat?"

560
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,280
And then this is where they're like,

561
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,680
"Oh, STEM can be fun too."

562
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,240
I try to teach the girls that STEM

563
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,640
is in every aspect of their lives.

564
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,080
It's in your phone.

565
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,840
It's in everything that you do.

566
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,560
It's in the computer.

567
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,760
It's in everything,

568
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,720
and this is where they want to be,

569
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,200
we need them to be curious

570
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,760
about every subject:

571
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,320
math, science, technology, engineering.

572
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,160
And also we need companies

573
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,400
to invest in our youth.

574
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,120
They keep complaining,

575
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,520
"Oh well, the pipeline is dry."

576
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,480
No, it's not. You need to start

577
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,160
investing in communities,

578
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,160
invest in teaching,

579
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,000
also invest in widening their scope

580
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,880
of recruiting so that

581
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,080
they're not just looking at

582
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,040
the high profile HBCUs

583
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,800
but also city colleges and state colleges.

584
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,080
They want the top four Ivy.

585
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,000
Come on, that's not who runs the world.

586
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,560
All right.

587
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,600
If we want to be able to be successful

588
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,200
with our technology moving forward,

589
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,440
we need to include more minorities

590
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,240
otherwise, globally,

591
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,560
we will not be able to interact.

592
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,560
Globally, our technology will not work

593
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,720
if we don't invite minorities

594
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,840
to have a seat at the table.

595
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,640
So, what we're doing at GIRL STEM STARS

596
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,720
is we're starting them as early

597
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,920
as seven years old to 18 years old.

598
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,200
And so, this is where we're building

599
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,280
the future leaders,

600
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,440
the future entrepreneurs,

601
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,880
the future decision makers,

602
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,280
the future business owners.

603
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,400
And this is where we'll see change.

604
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,240
That's just wonderful.

605
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,040
And obviously, as this is a nonprofit,

606
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,400
if anybody happens to listen to this

607
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,320
and is also passionate about this cause

608
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,280
and would like to contribute,

609
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,360
I'm sure that I can make an introduction

610
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,000
and send off the contact

611
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,520
for GIRL STEM STARS.

612
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,760
But before we leave, Kiwoba,

613
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,760
I have to ask the most important question:

614
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,800
three words that you would use

615
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,400
to describe yourself.

616
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,200
Yes, and thank you

617
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,400
for the plug on donations,

618
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,840
www.girlstemstars.org

619
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,040
you can make a donation there.

620
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,240
Three words about me.

621
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,440
One, I'm faithful.

622
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,240
I am a believer, and I'm truly grateful

623
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,880
that God has put this calling

624
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,240
for GIRL STEM STARS on my life.

625
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,520
And it's amazing. It has changed my life.

626
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,080
It changes the life of every person

627
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,800
who ever comes and volunteers

628
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,840
with these girls. They're like,

629
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,120
Oh my gosh. I didn't realize

630
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,040
it was so easy to just come

631
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,360
and roll up my sleeves,

632
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,280
meet these girls,

633
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,400
and then at the end of an eight hour day

634
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,840
or if it's just a couple of hours

635
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,400
on a virtual, the girls are so fun

636
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,080
and they see the little light bulbs

637
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,000
going of in the girls minds.

638
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,120
They're like, so moved going.

639
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,040
"I want to do that again."

640
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,320
So, we're not just touching the girls,

641
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,160
but we're also touching

642
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,680
employees at different companies,

643
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,960
we're touching executives.

644
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,440
And so, this is a great calling.

645
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,480
It needs to happen right now.

646
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,640
Right now.

647
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,200
This is a very rich environment

648
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,760
for the world to be able to start

649
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,520
making a difference on their own.

650
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,280
So like, this was my situation

651
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,760
where I don't see black people

652
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,800
on a daily basis in Silicon Valley.

653
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,640
But what is important to somebody else?

654
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,560
What makes you tick?

655
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,440
What's important to you?

656
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,040
Or what bugs you?

657
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,560
I'm asking you.

658
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,120
Right. Well, for me,

659
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,840
it's the dissemination of information.

660
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,480
There are so many people like you

661
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,560
that are so influential

662
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,400
and have so many incredible experiences

663
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,840
that without a medium

664
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,080
to disseminate this information,

665
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,400
the majority of the population

666
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,360
will not be able to hear it.

667
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,680
And especially the stories

668
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,280
that I try to cover here, these are not

669
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,840
TechCrunch or Crunchbase stories;

670
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,240
these are more about the journeys.

671
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,880
And the reason, the passion

672
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,360
that you're starting GIRL STEM STARS

673
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,160
and this sort of epiphany that you had

674
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,200
and this passion that you've acquired

675
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,440
over the years

676
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,040
and the trigger from that coma,

677
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,040
that's exactly the things

678
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,920
that I'd like to share.

679
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,320
Right. So, you're already walking out your,

680
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,000
and that's my next word is passion,

681
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,800
you're already walking out your passion.

682
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,640
When I've been on stage before

683
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,320
as a motivational speaker,

684
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,880
I ask some of the people in the front row,

685
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,280
"So, what are you interested in?

686
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,880
What bugs you?"

687
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,200
And one woman is like,

688
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,480
"I love the beach."

689
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:13,800
I'm like,

690
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,280
"Well, get your friends together

691
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,640
and go clean it up."

692
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,040
She's like,

693
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,160
"Oh, my gosh, it's that easy?"

694
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,440
I'm like, "Yes."

695
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,760
Find a purpose in your life

696
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,040
other than just the typical job

697
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,560
that you do on a daily basis.

698
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,760
It's as simple as,

699
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,240
okay, the next woman,

700
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,960
"Okay, what are you interested in?"

701
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,080
"Well, I love animals.

702
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,880
I love dogs."

703
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,480
Well then go take care of some dogs.

704
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,960
Go to a shelter, bring your friend,

705
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,520
get a Facebook group going, do something,

706
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,880
and you'll feel better as a human being

707
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,760
than just crunching at your daily job

708
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,480
when you have a purpose, right?
- 100%

709
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,520
And it's so easy.

710
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,160
Just think about

711
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,600
what am I interested in,

712
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,840
what I don't like in this world,

713
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,360
and then be the change you want to see

714
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,000
and get out there,

715
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,760
grab your friends, and do it.

716
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,560
It's that simple.

717
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,680
And I don't think everybody needs

718
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,920
a God epiphany and have

719
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,600
to nearly die to be able to come

720
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,280
to where I've gotten to.

721
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,720
I'm not telling people,

722
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,520
you can skip all that,

723
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,080
I'm just telling you

724
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,320
it's this easy, right.

725
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,400
It's this easy.

726
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:20,680
And then my next one is driven.

727
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,840
I'm faithful, I'm passionate,

728
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,280
and I'm driven

729
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,200
as you heard from my stories.
- That definitely exudes through this whole conversation.

730
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,800
of trying to start a nonprofit

731
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,040
from my recovery bed.

732
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,160
100%.

733
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,360
Very driven.

734
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,680
100%.

735
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,960
Kiwoba, thank you very much

736
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,400
for the time and for the inspiration.

737
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,600
This was just eye opening

738
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,680
and just wonderful.

739
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,040
Thank you very, very much.

740
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,600
Yes.

741
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,160
It's been an honor to be here.

742
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,600
Thank you so much for

743
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,360
showcasing GIRL STEM STARS today

744
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,600
