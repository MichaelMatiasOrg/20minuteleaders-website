1
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:38,599
Assaf Wand, thank you for being on

2
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,666
20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:40,732
Thanks for having me.

4
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:41,466
This is so special.

5
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:43,366
This is the first 20 Minute Leaders out of

6
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:45,932
I think 120 that I'm doing in person.

7
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:50,632
Anything that we can stretch it up is good.

8
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:51,732
Well I have the privilege of being here

9
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:52,866
in the Hippo offices.

10
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:54,099
Being in New Hippo.

11
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,399
I'm fully software engineer here.

12
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,499
And I've been waiting for a very long time

13
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,732
to do a video with you.

14
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:00,332
So, I'm very happy to do it in person.

15
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,332
Assaf, who are you?

16
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,966
Wow.

17
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:05,999
Every single person that I meet in the valley

18
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,232
in Tel Aviv, wherever,

19
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:08,399
they know Assaf Wand.

20
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,499
Everybody knows Assaf Wand.

21
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,299
Why is that?

22
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,666
It's from the picture that

23
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:13,699
I used to have in Ayalon.

24
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,532
Me and Bar Refaeli hug together, I think.

25
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:18,632
We don't actually have a picture together.

26
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:19,299
No of course not.

27
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,999
No, but look at this snout, do you think

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,966
I just put in any picture.

29
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:30,132
I think it's a combination of two things.

30
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:33,099
I think it's a combination of me being

31
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,532
full enough time in this scene.

32
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:41,866
Plus basing in the belief that

33
00:03:41,867 --> 00:03:42,899
entrepreneurship is in the

34
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,832
creative environment.

35
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:46,732
And because of that,

36
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:49,699
you help whenever you can.

37
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,632
And you pass the back forward

38
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:53,499
and you're always being helpful.

39
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,632
And the question you should ask is

40
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:55,532
"How can I help you?"

41
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:59,966
Over a period of time.

42
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:02,999
How long have you been an entrepreneur?

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,032
How long do you consider yourself?

44
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:06,532
Is it from back from IDC Israel?

45
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:08,766
From the army? When do you consider

46
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:10,732
yourself an entrepreneur?

47
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,932
I don’t know.

48
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:14,566
I never consider myself an entrepreneur.

49
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:15,232
I just consider myself

50
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:17,099
I cannot work for anybody.

51
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,266
I'm the worst employee there is.

52
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:20,266
So, the only other option for me

53
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:22,799
was to build my own environment.

54
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,766
Right.

55
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:26,866
I'm just I'm not very good with hierarchy.

56
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:30,299
I'm not very good in consulting.

57
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,199
I was a mediocre consultant with McKinsey

58
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,366
I'm a lot better entrepreneur.

59
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:37,332
I think I'm an okay Manager.

60
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,866
Interesting.

61
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:41,066
I think I'm set up for you know,

62
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:42,366
I don't like status quo.

63
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,732
Ever since I was a kid

64
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:45,999
it doesn't matter what.

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,566
I can go to the ice cream parlor,

66
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:49,999
and I'm like in my mind,

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,499
that's the dumbest thing ever.

68
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,932
Because they should pick up the money

69
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:55,466
in here and do the turnover there.

70
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:56,532
And then they should--

71
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:57,532
So you're always thinking about

72
00:04:57,533 --> 00:04:58,732
how to transition?

73
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:01,032
And I'm not good if I,

74
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:03,766
And I believe that

75
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:06,999
you should always jump in and change.

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,832
And if you're not, then shut the fuck up.

77
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,499
Because you don't have any say.

78
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,899
And because of that,

79
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,032
basically entrepreneur

80
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:15,832
or what is considered now to be entrepreneur

81
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,532
you can call it self-employed

82
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:19,532
in a certain time. In between jobs.

83
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:20,832
Whatever term you wanna call it.

84
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,399
That's what I'm set up.

85
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,366
Interesting. Okay.

86
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:25,166
So, Hippo. An entrepreneur you know,

87
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:27,299
a lot of people are going to cybersecurity

88
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,166
into different B2C products, it’s a lot.

89
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:31,799
I mean most of the things we see on TV,

90
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,132
are B2C and these really fun products.

91
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:36,499
And you're going to insurance.

92
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,366
A really heavy industry.

93
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:39,532
A very old industry.

94
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:41,599
And not something that the average

95
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,932
entrepreneur industry would say,

96
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:45,332
"Yes, I'm ready to go into insurance."

97
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,599
Yes. What's up with that?

98
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,299
Probably all of the stuff that I believe

99
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,499
in entrepreneurship, plus all of the

100
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,432
corrections from my prior fuck ups,

101
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:58,066
exactly in that feat.

102
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:01,266
So, let's break them into different components.

103
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:02,199
Let's do it.

104
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,199
One, it's a massive fund.

105
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,732
It's a $100 billion.

106
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,799
Just home insurance itself in the US.

107
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,699
So, I'm not even talking global

108
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,332
and stuff like that.

109
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,132
In the US, it's a $100 billion market.

110
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:15,966
That grows $5 billion dollars a year.

111
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:18,032
So, it's not this question of

112
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:20,266
Gartner is saying that by 2027

113
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:22,599
This feat is gonna be $2.3 billion.

114
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,199
And you have 17 different companies

115
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,566
vying for VC money

116
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:28,332
to basically go into that field.

117
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,599
It's also a very interesting thing

118
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,299
Because when you're pitching VCs

119
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:32,966
it's not about,

120
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:35,632
"Am I gonna be the most dominant?

121
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:37,466
And kills state farm in all state?"

122
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:39,232
No. It has a lot of space for

123
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,932
a lot of other players in the market.

124
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,732
Give us 1% of this market.

125
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:44,699
We build a five, $10 billion company.

126
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,266
Let's go up 30 thousand feet,

127
00:06:47,267 --> 00:06:48,566
We will recon then we'll come back down.

128
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:49,999
What is insurance?

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,366
What is a home buyers’ insurance?

130
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:53,866
In the US over the past few decades,

131
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:54,566
what are we seeing?

132
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:56,732
Because what we do at Hippo here,

133
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,199
is something pretty unique

134
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,332
in the scope of insurance giving.

135
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:05,499
Yup. So, think about home insurance

136
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,432
the last hundred years.

137
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:10,999
Channel is solely VR agents.

138
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,732
You're being sold insurance VR agent.

139
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:14,499
Right.

140
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,532
The average age of an agent now in the US

141
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:17,099
is 60.

142
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,999
60?

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,432
Yes. There's less than half the agent

144
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:20,566
that used to be 10 years ago.

145
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:22,332
Wow. So, now there's a bunch of--

146
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,599
When was the last time that you're able to

147
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,566
But more people are buying home.

148
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:25,499
So, how does that make sense?

149
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,766
Agents don't wanna sell you

150
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,166
home insurance. They wanna shift

151
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:31,266
to what you said the commercial home.

152
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:33,099
That where you don't have high frequency

153
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,866
and you sell a lot more cars on the road.

154
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:37,266
But do you wanna service people

155
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:38,099
that have car insurance?

156
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,999
Because every 1.7 years you have a claim

157
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,399
when someone nicked your car,

158
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,332
you had an accident,

159
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,832
and then you're calling your agents.

160
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,132
I need a replacement car.

161
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,732
They fix it. They didn't fix it.

162
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:48,932
There was a depreciation.

163
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:50,199
There's a point where I said, "F it."

164
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,599
Listen, I just wanna do it.

165
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,832
I prefer to sell you something that

166
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,332
doesn’t have a high frequency.

167
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,866
And I make a lot more money.

168
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:59,432
So, hence auto insurance

169
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:00,532
is shifted to be direct.

170
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:02,266
You're going to [--]

171
00:08:02,267 --> 00:08:04,266
You've buying VR call center via the web.

172
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:06,332
Our analysis was that there is gonna be

173
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:09,266
similar lines that are bound to go

174
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:10,199
to the route of direct.

175
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,499
Home insurance is one.

176
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,766
SMB is two.

177
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:14,899
And the third one is life insurance.

178
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,766
And we start to analyze all of these things

179
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,466
And we thought home insurance

180
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:20,799
is something that fits our core skills of

181
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,799
going deep into specific areas,

182
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,532
a lot of data, and this is gonna be tweaks.

183
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:28,166
So, firstly moving into the direct.

184
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:29,166
To enable you to purchase

185
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:29,766
however you want.

186
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:32,732
You can buy online mobile via

187
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:34,132
our call center that belongs to us.

188
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:35,566
Via other insurance company that

189
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:37,532
sells it. Via independent real agnostic.

190
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:38,766
You always gonna get the same price.

191
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:43,199
Second thing, coverage is stuck in the 60s.

192
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,999
So, if you actually have the time

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,099
when you're ever gonna do it.

194
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,199
you're gonna open your home insurance

195
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,999
policy, you'll see that you're cover for

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,566
stuff like foreclose, $5,000.

197
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:55,999
Mausoleums and crypts, $6,000.

198
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,732
I don’t know.

199
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:02,566
China silverware, copperware,

200
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:04,866
things like that, gold bullions, covered

201
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:07,132
Stamp collection, $2,000.

202
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:09,666
Physical bonds that your granddad

203
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:12,432
gave you for, covered.

204
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:14,699
But electronics capped at $2,000.

205
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,666
That's you have at the old back.

206
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:17,999
Now that you have this fancy equipment

207
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,166
it's even more.

208
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:20,599
But it's more than that.

209
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,999
Home office, not covered.

210
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,232
Bicycle, camping equipments,

211
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:26,999
tools, ski equipments.

212
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,832
So, basically the things that actually are

213
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,599
happening with the millennial generation

214
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,632
within new home buyers.

215
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:32,032
Not just millennials.

216
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:33,266
I'm not a millennial.

217
00:09:33,267 --> 00:09:35,199
And I have a lot more electronics

218
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,966
in my home office, and you know

219
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:38,699
a lot of other stuff that happens.

220
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,032
There were some other stuff that

221
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:42,132
when we started the company was also

222
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:44,999
challenging lifestyle for us.

223
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,099
For instance gay couples,

224
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,332
In state that wouldn’t recognize it

225
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:51,132
couldn’t be registered as both of them

226
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,132
on the same policy.

227
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,732
Really. Yes, because it's recognized as the

228
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:56,699
they are married. So, they're not ready.

229
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,299
So, we lived together but only my

230
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,366
half of the closet is covered for lawsuit.

231
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,166
But not your half.

232
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:04,599
It was just very foreign to us,

233
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,032
to our people if they're alive.

234
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:08,866
And we thought that this is about

235
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:09,999
modernizing insurance.

236
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,132
And doing like that.

237
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:13,666
So, we started the company five years ago.

238
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:14,699
While the thought was,

239
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,132
We're gonna build--

240
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:18,366
Or modernizing insurance.

241
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,432
That's the second thing.

242
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:20,266
We started with like,

243
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:21,599
We're gonna build progressive or GEICO

244
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,632
for home insurance. Even if you buy.

245
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:24,099
That's how we started.

246
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,932
Then we realized, the coverages are off.

247
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:27,599
So, we need to modernize home insurance.

248
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,132
And now, we're at the point which is

249
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:35,566
it's for the not misbranding kind of thing

250
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:37,832
because we haven’t massage it enough.

251
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,832
But it's a shift on being a reactive company

252
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,499
to proactive.

253
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,266
Insurance is a reactive experience.

254
00:10:44,267 --> 00:10:46,266
Yeah. But crappy onboarding that they want,

255
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:47,266
we changed that.

256
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:49,299
We spend a lot of time.

257
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,532
You're very familiar with that.

258
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:51,732
To make it seamless.

259
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:53,266
Prefeed all of the data for you.

260
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:55,132
And then you have a crappy experience

261
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:56,766
at [--], which we have

262
00:10:56,767 --> 00:10:57,699
a [--],

263
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,432
and were doing everything 24/7.

264
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:02,299
And we have an MPS of 70 on the claims.

265
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:02,899
When you have a--

266
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,199
On the claims. On the claims.

267
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,066
In the horrible situation

268
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:06,266
you have an MPS of 70.

269
00:11:06,267 --> 00:11:07,066
Because we need to be very honest

270
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,499
with our customers and help them there.

271
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,699
And what really drives me now,

272
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,932
is this nine-year time frame,

273
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:15,499
that Michael is a customer of Hippo,

274
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,499
until you have a claim.

275
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,732
Now think about that time.

276
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:20,599
A insurance companies don’t even call you

277
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,232
a customer. They call you a policy holder.

278
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:24,099
Because the customer was the agent.

279
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,232
Not the end customer.

280
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:27,932
I would say the day that I onboarded Hippo

281
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:30,866
the number of times that my onboarding

282
00:11:30,867 --> 00:11:31,966
managers told me,

283
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,899
"Michael, we're looking at customers.

284
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,732
Not policy numbers.

285
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:36,166
Just get that out of your head.

286
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:37,766
We're customer forward

287
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:38,599
We're just forward."

288
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,732
Yes. Now we have multiple agents

289
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,199
that sell us. Also, our customer.

290
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,166
It's completely fine.

291
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:44,199
We need to build them tools,

292
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,866
to basically address them

293
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:46,632
in the rightful way,

294
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:47,999
just like we need to focus back

295
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,966
on the customer.

296
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:50,766
So, think about that.

297
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:53,232
You bought a policy.

298
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:54,932
It was a shitty experience. Fine.

299
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:55,699
You forgot about it.

300
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,032
And then you know upfront,

301
00:11:58,033 --> 00:11:59,366
when you bought a policy.

302
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:00,632
That after nine years

303
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:01,666
when you're gonna have a claim,

304
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:03,366
the first sentence that's gonna come

305
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:04,499
out of your mouth is,

306
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,932
"I knew this shit's gonna happen."

307
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,199
For nine years,

308
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,199
Ive been seeing guys every month.

309
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,066
And just when it's gonna happen

310
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:11,399
I knew this is gonna happen.

311
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,732
Like you know when you--

312
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,266
Show me how many products in the world

313
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,832
you're buying it knowing

314
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,032
it's gonna be like that when it's gonna happen.

315
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:21,899
More than that, it's a bizarre product

316
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,866
to begin with and we can have a

317
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,299
side discussion on that.

318
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,066
It's a product that US customer

319
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:28,299
don't ever wanna use and Mia is the person

320
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,899
who actually give you the product

321
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,266
don’t want you to ever use.

322
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:33,599
It's a very awkward kind of border.

323
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,666
Okay. So, now what we decide is

324
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,099
this nine-year time frame

325
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,399
that you were customer,

326
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,032
How can we align interest?

327
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:44,532
How can we treat our customers differently?

328
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:46,032
Now, you don't wanna hear

329
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:47,699
from your insurance company,

330
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,799
me sending you weekly

331
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,699
Like what the hell, just got to block me

332
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,732
on the spam and we haven’t done anything.

333
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:55,166
So, there needs to be something deep

334
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,132
in alignment.

335
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:59,532
And insurance now is a reactive forces.

336
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:02,366
You're paying every year on the renewal.

337
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:03,932
Then after nine years you have a claim.

338
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:06,499
And now the insurance companies,

339
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,799
that's the time to deliver on that.

340
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,766
It's usually it doesn’t work with.

341
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:11,632
So we thought about that.

342
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:13,766
What's the best experience in the world

343
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:14,632
for a claim?

344
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:16,532
Is that you had a claim,

345
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:19,099
and five seconds later someone’s step in

346
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,066
you had a damage in your roof.

347
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:21,932
There was a leak in the roof.

348
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:23,899
And its $20 thousand.

349
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,899
You need to replace your roof.

350
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,132
And five seconds later, someone came.

351
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:29,199
Michael, here’s your $20 thousand check.

352
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,599
Which is exactly the sum.

353
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,299
And this is as good as it can be.

354
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,732
But then for three weeks

355
00:13:33,733 --> 00:13:34,466
you're not gonna be at home.

356
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:35,866
You need to find a contractor

357
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:36,766
to fix your roof.

358
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:38,432
You probably lost some of the artifacts

359
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:39,732
that you have in the stuff.

360
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:41,166
All of your favorite clothes.

361
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:44,099
Your favorite sofa. And it's a mess.

362
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,566
And this is as good as it can be.

363
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:48,766
That someone gave you.

364
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:50,566
My insurance company was amazing.

365
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:52,532
I had a damage and they paid everything

366
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:53,399
on the spot.

367
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,199
That's not a crappy experience.

368
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,532
So, we thought what can be better than that?

369
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:59,132
And we thought that the best experience

370
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:01,232
is if we avoid a claim from happening

371
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:02,066
in the first place.

372
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:04,066
Which is good for us an insurance company.

373
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:04,932
But it's very good for you.

374
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:07,432
So this is was our shift.

375
00:14:07,433 --> 00:14:08,966
To be proactive insurance company.

376
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:09,832
That has three components.

377
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,199
One, we basically said,

378
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,932
"Why do we use the data only once?"

379
00:14:14,933 --> 00:14:17,332
If I'm already pre-filling all of the data

380
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,932
aerial imagery to see the condition

381
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:21,232
of the roof. Permit records and all of that.

382
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:22,499
Why are doing it only once

383
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,232
for the onboarding?

384
00:14:23,233 --> 00:14:24,599
Shouldn’t we do underwriting

385
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,532
on a on-going basis?

386
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:26,799
So every time I have an

387
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,866
aerial imagery pulled.

388
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,032
We're running all of our customers

389
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:32,099
basically homes through that.

390
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,399
And if there is a discoloration on the roof,

391
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,399
on Michael's home,

392
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,899
Someone is gonna call your citizen.

393
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,866
Our datas, you know the home monitoring

394
00:14:38,867 --> 00:14:39,866
your home from time to time.

395
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:41,566
Our datas also showed that

396
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:44,166
you had a discoloration on the roof.

397
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:45,632
I think we should send roof serve.

398
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:46,932
Anyway, it's gonna be free of charge.

399
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:48,466
I mean, that's for the modernization

400
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:50,299
where you're not relying on just them

401
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,332
filling out a 15-minute questionnaire of,

402
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,566
what year was roof build?

403
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:55,966
No, but you know it's exactly--

404
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:56,999
You go and you're automatically

405
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,066
you're able to pulling these sources and

406
00:14:58,067 --> 00:15:00,232
it's not just passively pulling them.

407
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,032
You're also actively looking in

408
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:03,399
developing technologies.

409
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,099
They are able to look at pictures.

410
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,032
Look at aerial maps.

411
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:08,199
Consulted with different APIs and

412
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,399
then real perform a high analysis.

413
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,699
It is ongoing and let's do an ongoing

414
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,366
to help prevention from happening

415
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:15,099
in the first place.

416
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,932
I give you an example.

417
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:19,766
I think 14% of our customers

418
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:21,966
have something material

419
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:22,832
changing their house

420
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,132
when it comes to renewed.

421
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:25,632
And I mean, added a swimming pool.

422
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,132
Turn the garage into a living room.

423
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:31,599
Do a full redo of the kitchen

424
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,599
and stuff like that.

425
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,932
Not a single one called us.

426
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:35,966
Now, I don’t blame them.

427
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:37,466
Because it's not why they--

428
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:39,099
Now, when we're calling our sales,

429
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,832
Now Michael, we saw that you added

430
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,566
a swimming pool. And by the way,

431
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,166
I think we should increase your liability

432
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:47,099
insurance because there’s a chance that

433
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,032
that the kid's neighbor is gonna jump

434
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:50,499
into the pool when you're away.

435
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,932
And it's risky.

436
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:53,266
I think we should increase it.

437
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:54,932
It's gonna cost you an extra two dollars

438
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:55,632
per day.

439
00:15:55,633 --> 00:15:58,332
And 99.9% of them say,

440
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,332
"Oh, thank you so much.

441
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,932
I really really forgot about that."

442
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:02,699
Now, sometimes it’s the other way around.

443
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,366
Sometimes we saw that the permits

444
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:07,299
would show that you replace the roof.

445
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,366
And you're entitled to a 5% discount.

446
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:11,632
It's not about maximizing and upselling

447
00:16:11,633 --> 00:16:12,732
It's about making sure

448
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:14,266
That this contract that we have

449
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:17,132
of the insurance company and the insured

450
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:18,699
is that we'll gonna be the safety net.

451
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,032
And instead of the safety net,

452
00:16:20,033 --> 00:16:21,066
we're smaller and smaller and

453
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:21,866
have gaping holes.

454
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:23,732
We're constantly making sure that

455
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,432
it's the right kind of safety net

456
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:27,732
to catch you if God forbids something happen.

457
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:29,499
And this is what [--]

458
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,799
So, one is using the data to do

459
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,699
ongoing on the lighting.

460
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,466
Second thing is we give packages,

461
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:38,566
IOT device. We actually, in this home

462
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:39,499
you can probably bring from

463
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,399
the other side of the table. Yes.

464
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,699
Actually, this is one of the most

465
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,332
one of the things that excite me most

466
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,732
about what we're doing here. It's this.

467
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:48,866
We have several formats.

468
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:50,899
This is every customer of Hippo is getting.

469
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,432
That. Let's open that.

470
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:53,766
This is your kangaroo?

471
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:55,099
This is the kangaroo 1.

472
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,199
Wow. It is so cool.

473
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,832
It has a bunch of stuff.

474
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,399
It has a motion sensor.

475
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,532
Smoke detector.

476
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:02,899
Fire Alarm.

477
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,199
What happens when the person gets it

478
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,599
The first they smile and then

479
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,599
They just plug it in.

480
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,099
They install it. What happens then?

481
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,532
So A, they get a discount.

482
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:14,066
They get a smart on discount.

483
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,266
For the products.

484
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:18,466
B, these are self-monitored kits.

485
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:22,899
This is not Hippo's monitoring

486
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:22,566
them with these things.

487
00:17:22,567 --> 00:17:24,832
We have two smart-on kind of strategy.

488
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,932
We have something which is the basic one

489
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:28,399
which is self-monitor. Which is this one.

490
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,199
And then we have official monitoring.

491
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,399
Where you're also paying $15 to $20

492
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,666
a month and you get a full monitoring

493
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:35,566
or you know.

494
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:37,399
And then it doesn’t come to us,

495
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,366
It comes to the police and stuff like that.

496
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:42,466
But we only get if it’s on or off.

497
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:44,166
But it's self-monitors.

498
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:45,566
It's not living Big Brother

499
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:47,399
and monitoring that and copy.

500
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,299
It's not about that.

501
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,266
It's about alerting you that you have

502
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:51,899
a water leak in your basement.

503
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,132
Now, I'm gonna go and check it out.

504
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:56,532
As oppose to the water leaking

505
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,299
for three days

506
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,232
and then I'm coming to the basement

507
00:17:58,233 --> 00:17:59,366
and then it's completely full.

508
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:00,699
It's about these things.

509
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,232
So, one is using the data ongoing.

510
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:04,999
Second one is smart home.

511
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,666
And every customer is basically

512
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,266
unless they opt out, get that.

513
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:14,432
Are people open to doing that?

514
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:15,432
To look in the--

515
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:18,366
We have I think 75% to 80%

516
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:19,132
installation rate.

517
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:20,632
So, which is crazy. That's insane.

518
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,132
Which is crazy because 10%, 12%

519
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:24,532
are opting out.

520
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:27,332
So, 8% are like you know,

521
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,032
[--]

522
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:31,132
When I see a win-win situation,

523
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:33,432
you're sending them these devices that

524
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:35,366
Hippo is sponsoring. Then you tell them,

525
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:36,999
"Listen, we're not gonna make money

526
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,366
off of this. Let's form a win-win.

527
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,399
You're gonna plug this and you get

528
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,566
a discount on your quote.

529
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:42,299
And you're not gonna lose your house.

530
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,332
You're not gonna lose your belongings.

531
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,032
None of us want that.

532
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:46,099
You don’t wanna lose your belongings.

533
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,266
We don’t wanna file a claim.

534
00:18:47,267 --> 00:18:48,999
So let’s come up with a win win situation.

535
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,332
Or we avoid it in the first place.

536
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,632
It's on us. And you get to--

537
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,866
That was exactly the strategy of design.

538
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:55,799
That is so cool.

539
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,532
And is that proving itself? Yes.

540
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:58,866
So, now you have this thing in over

541
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:01,232
dozens and thousands of homes.

542
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:04,732
Proving itself? We need more time

543
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:09,266
to have statistically significant component.

544
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:09,966
It's a venture capital, you need at least

545
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:11,699
nine years to show a returns.

546
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,932
It does statistically significant

547
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:13,799
we know that for me,

548
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,699
everything in insurance

549
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,832
needs to make a claim.

550
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,566
So, for me to say that it reduced by 4%

551
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:20,399
I need you up over a certain [--]

552
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,432
An AAB to ASN.

553
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:23,499
But it's definition.

554
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,099
But intuitively as CO because now,

555
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,099
because you have to know.

556
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,866
I get a lot of personal emails.

557
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:28,866
I get people who are like

558
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,766
Thank you so much for this.

559
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:32,199
We had a leak in this.

560
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,666
And you stopped it.

561
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:35,499
Or we have a problem you know,

562
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,432
We walk suddenly in

563
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:37,332
the middle of the night.

564
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,366
Because there was a fire alarm.

565
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,566
And then we realize there was a fire.

566
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:41,966
And it was in another room.

567
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:43,366
And stuff like that.

568
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:45,699
So, even sporadically,

569
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,232
Even if I have a hundred water claims.

570
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:49,532
And I stopped one in a hundred.

571
00:19:49,533 --> 00:19:50,932
It's better than not having it.

572
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:54,266
Plus the sense of trust and stuff like that.

573
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:55,632
The last thing which is also

574
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:56,566
interesting for that,

575
00:19:56,567 --> 00:20:00,366
I think it helped build a brand.

576
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,166
So, the thing is this.

577
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,532
If you wanna build a brand, in general.

578
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:06,099
You need to bring consistent benefit

579
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:06,699
to a customer.

580
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,432
Insurance companies when I ask you,

581
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:10,766
"oh, you're auto insure with I don’t know

582
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:12,766
all state farm, maybe farm mills.

583
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:13,932
It's all sounds different.

584
00:20:13,933 --> 00:20:15,466
Because nobody use them.

585
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:16,299
Nobody's in touch point with them.

586
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:16,599
[--]

587
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,399
And that's it. And then it stays.

588
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,199
And maybe if you have a claim,

589
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,032
you remember that.

590
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:22,366
I go on my Gmail and I look up

591
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:24,099
insurance car and I look nobody else.

592
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,566
And then you learn, and then

593
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:25,866
Yes. Okay, now I need to auto put.

594
00:20:25,867 --> 00:20:27,166
So, think about that.

595
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:29,699
That in order for us to build a brand,

596
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,199
we need to bring value to the customer

597
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,666
on one on one basis.

598
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,832
This send you, that the door is lock.

599
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:35,899
the door is unlock.

600
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,832
there was a water leak.

601
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,032
there's not a water leak.

602
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:40,499
You build an affinity and you pulling it,

603
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,232
that's a good positive kind of thing.

604
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:43,832
Which is very beneficial.

605
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,032
What's a hippopotamus?

606
00:20:45,033 --> 00:20:46,866
Right outside of this room

607
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:48,066
we have a huge hippopotamus

608
00:20:48,067 --> 00:20:48,866
staring at us.

609
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:52,399
Yes. There are two answers.

610
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,966
So the answer I usually give--

611
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:54,732
I want the real one.

612
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:56,399
The answer I usually give,

613
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,532
the real one is not, it's sexy adult

614
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:00,632
So I want the not real one.

615
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:02,799
Usually, the answer that I'm giving is that

616
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,732
everything with a word mutual, and state,

617
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:05,866
and farm was taken,

618
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:06,866
So we have to come up with

619
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:08,132
something different.

620
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,166
But the real answer is,

621
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:13,099
so, in the world of branch today

622
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,132
there's no more branch.

623
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:16,732
Try and fine a name for a company

624
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:19,232
that you got the domain,

625
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:20,632
you get the Twitter handled.

626
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:22,166
and you get the Facebook thing.

627
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:24,132
You don't have 15 typos

628
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:26,132
that ends with CO

629
00:21:26,133 --> 00:21:28,766
It's just not something that happens.

630
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:31,099
So, you're trying to find--

631
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,032
[--]

632
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:34,232
[--]

633
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:36,266
Let's look at flowers.

634
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:37,466
Let's look at great gods.

635
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:39,932
Let's look at places.

636
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:41,099
Let's look at monuments.

637
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,266
Let's look and you're realizing

638
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:45,566
really really fast there's no more names.

639
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:46,799
So, then at the end of the day,

640
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,899
you find something that you know,

641
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,966
you don’t really get the domain,

642
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:51,032
but the domain is somewhat available.

643
00:21:51,033 --> 00:21:53,466
Your kind of making something and said

644
00:21:53,467 --> 00:21:54,432
"You know what?"

645
00:21:54,433 --> 00:21:56,732
And it's not associated. You go for it.

646
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,332
And in our case, it was Hippo.

647
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,799
Where if you would have asked me,

648
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,699
five years ago, I would have told you,

649
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,932
"There's probably 80% chance

650
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:03,532
we're gonna change."

651
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:04,366
It's a place holder.

652
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:07,599
That was like, let's say we like it

653
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,666
But it's probably gonna pop up

654
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:10,699
as a problem or something like that.

655
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,799
And we would probably need to do

656
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,266
a re-do of the brand and stuff like that.

657
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:16,999
And with time, we actually like it

658
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,266
more and more --

659
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:19,366
It's awesome.

660
00:22:19,367 --> 00:22:21,166
Now, there's also another thing.

661
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:24,099
I have read too many books on that.

662
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,666
But if I summarized them into

663
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:27,132
one kind of sentence is,

664
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:30,732
The earlier the person who can grasp

665
00:22:30,733 --> 00:22:32,766
your brand, the better the brand is.

666
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:34,499
And the less it associated.

667
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,399
So, apple has no association with

668
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,566
electronics and what it is

669
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:39,866
But it really worked in grasp the name.

670
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:40,832
Freaking awesome.

671
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,066
So, you're trying to find something,

672
00:22:43,067 --> 00:22:44,166
Google. Similar, yeah.

673
00:22:44,167 --> 00:22:46,399
But Google is probably an eight-year-old

674
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,166
can grasp. Not a three-year-old.

675
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,099
Then the name Google?

676
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,966
It's not trivial. It's not a concept.

677
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:54,732
Yeah, its Google.

678
00:22:54,733 --> 00:22:56,966
There is something behind it.

679
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:59,399
But it used to be a time that progressive.

680
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,332
So, you're trying to find something.

681
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,799
And not that everybody likes that

682
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,199
insurance company so you try to find

683
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,866
something not associated with insurance.

684
00:23:06,867 --> 00:23:07,899
Which is memorable.

685
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,699
It's kind of like you know,

686
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,499
there is the elevator kind of test

687
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,499
on telling a story.

688
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,599
This is, it's an elevator test on

689
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,699
remembering the brand

690
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,799
when someone leaves the elevator.

691
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,532
Not, what's the name of the company?

692
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:20,799
What's the chances of me telling,

693
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,132
"Listen, we're an insurance company

694
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,099
called Hippo." Just that.

695
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,932
And then three days later,

696
00:23:24,933 --> 00:23:26,699
What was the name? Yes, Hippo.

697
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,066
There's a way higher likely

698
00:23:28,067 --> 00:23:28,932
of the brain memory.

699
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:29,966
And that was basically

700
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:31,032
the thought behind it.

701
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:33,799
Of course we have Hippo stands for

702
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,499
Home Insurance Policy blah blah..

703
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,699
Assaf, I can't believe we already

704
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,299
have to go in a minute.

705
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,399
But I have to get your point of view.

706
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,999
You're in a hyper growth state.

707
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,532
The company is doing very very well.

708
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:47,399
Already unicorn.

709
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,332
Lots and lots of unemployed.

710
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:51,099
How many employees are we now

711
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,166
in the company?

712
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:53,266
270.

713
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:54,432
270 employees.

714
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,699
Did you think when you sold your

715
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,632
last business that you're gonna be

716
00:23:57,633 --> 00:23:58,632
running five years later?

717
00:23:58,633 --> 00:24:00,099
Of course not. Are you kidding me?

718
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,299
270 employees.

719
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,132
Assaf, you wake up. You have to leave

720
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:05,432
270 people and it's growing.

721
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:07,332
So, every week I'm getting new emails.

722
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,466
Welcome blah blah blah.

723
00:24:08,467 --> 00:24:09,199
Welcome blah blah blah.

724
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,466
How do you approach this state of mind?

725
00:24:12,467 --> 00:24:13,599
Have you done this before?

726
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,099
Experiencing this growth?

727
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,499
No. Not ever.

728
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,932
But that's the reason why

729
00:24:21,933 --> 00:24:22,632
we're not selling.

730
00:24:22,633 --> 00:24:24,032
And we're excited to come every day.

731
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:26,032
It's the growth mindset.

732
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:28,532
And I personally learn

733
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:29,332
And the rest of the team.

734
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,732
is learning by evolving

735
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:32,866
and moving to the next step.

736
00:24:32,867 --> 00:24:34,999
Everyday it's a new day.

737
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,399
It's a new learning.

738
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,332
It's a different company.

739
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:40,566
I always ask myself,

740
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:42,632
"Am I the right person to lead the company?"

741
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:44,366
"Am I the best CEO for the company?"

742
00:24:44,367 --> 00:24:46,466
"Can someone else be better?"

743
00:24:46,467 --> 00:24:48,866
"What do I need to personally learn

744
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:50,866
to be better?"

745
00:24:50,867 --> 00:24:51,799
Or if I have gaps,

746
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,399
"Who should I break into?"

747
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,566
Do you feel the same intimacy

748
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:57,499
with the brand and with this desk

749
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,299
and this walls as the days go by

750
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,932
and you disassociate more and more

751
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:04,099
with the everyday things?

752
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,466
Because you must be different.

753
00:25:06,467 --> 00:25:11,666
Probably the hardest thing for me

754
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:12,966
on my growth journey,

755
00:25:12,967 --> 00:25:14,566
was to let go of stuff.

756
00:25:14,567 --> 00:25:16,266
I used to know every freakin thing.

757
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:18,432
Every new office. Every contract.

758
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,066
Everything. And there's a certain point

759
00:25:20,067 --> 00:25:22,932
That you can’t because the entire management

760
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:25,066
basically experience is about leverage.

761
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:26,566
Finding someone else than can

762
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,166
level at you. And what you're doing.

763
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:29,299
And the second thing,

764
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,399
you find people that are way

765
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,832
stronger than you in what they are doing.

766
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,766
You know, Fannie is way better

767
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:35,166
technologist than what I am.

768
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,666
And in order to attract the right talent,

769
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:39,299
you need to let go and let them run

770
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,166
their own stuff and not intervene.

771
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:43,766
And trust them to brief me on the stuff

772
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:44,566
that I need to be brief.

773
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:49,299
So, on one side, I'm not on the minutiae

774
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,266
on the other stuff, I'm exposed to a lot

775
00:25:53,267 --> 00:25:54,732
broader kind of things.

776
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:55,532
Which is so fine and

777
00:25:55,533 --> 00:25:56,299
and really really interested.

778
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,732
That's part of the evolution and the growth.

779
00:25:57,733 --> 00:26:00,366
And I'm constantly, what's the next steps?

780
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:01,466
How can I evolve?

781
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:05,632
The day that I feel that I have grown

782
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:06,899
enough to accommodate the business,

783
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,432
Or that I've hit my mark

784
00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:11,799
That would be a different discussion.

785
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,199
Do you feel that you'll be able to have

786
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,299
the discussion with yourself?

787
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,466
Yeah. I have no egos when it comes

788
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:18,866
to the company on these things.

789
00:26:18,867 --> 00:26:19,499
Even though it's your baby

790
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,432
and you grow it from day one?

791
00:26:20,433 --> 00:26:26,732
It's not that since I was for reward

792
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:27,999
I wanted to be a CEO of

793
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,966
a private insurance company.

794
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:30,532
Or something like that.

795
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:32,932
That's not the driving force for me.

796
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:38,732
It's about education, growth,

797
00:26:38,733 --> 00:26:41,432
dream good, making an impact,

798
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,299
learning every day.

799
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,199
Because I think entrepreneurship is shit,

800
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,466
is hard, is difficult.

801
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:47,032
But there are several things that

802
00:26:47,033 --> 00:26:48,299
you can control.

803
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,399
You can control the domain

804
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,632
that you're working in.

805
00:26:50,633 --> 00:26:51,632
And what you're working on.

806
00:26:51,633 --> 00:26:53,399
The people that you worked with.

807
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,099
And the culture.

808
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,099
And this is the biggest thing.

809
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,466
And as long as you're working

810
00:26:58,467 --> 00:26:59,499
on something that is interesting and

811
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,666
exciting, people that you like,

812
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:04,166
And I can see the influence of the culture

813
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:05,566
And I like the culture of the company.

814
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:07,599
That's probably I'm gonna keep on doing.

815
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,166
I love it. Assaf, three words that

816
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:11,032
best describe you. How would you

817
00:27:11,033 --> 00:27:12,099
describe yourself in three words?

818
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,732
This is something that I ask

819
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:15,432
every person on the show.

820
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:17,032
And it's now fascinating

821
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:17,932
to see it come together.

822
00:27:17,933 --> 00:27:20,866
So, it's not bored.

823
00:27:20,867 --> 00:27:22,466
So, Independent thinker.

824
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:26,932
I believe in strong opinions loosely held.

825
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:28,999
Strong opinions loosely held.

826
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,266
I think that when you come into a

827
00:27:30,267 --> 00:27:31,966
discussion, you should have an opinion.

828
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:34,432
That you should defend it.

829
00:27:34,433 --> 00:27:35,666
And you should be thoughtful.

830
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:38,032
But you should be open.

831
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:40,266
That if someone comes up with data,

832
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:41,999
and stuff like that. That you're, okay

833
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,932
I can see and you loosely held on opinion.

834
00:27:45,933 --> 00:27:46,566
So the second part is just as important

835
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:47,566
as the first one? Yes.

836
00:27:47,567 --> 00:27:50,866
Which is part of the other stuff is

837
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:51,932
we have obligation to descend.

838
00:27:51,933 --> 00:27:54,066
and all of that other stuff is part of the culture.

839
00:27:54,067 --> 00:28:04,032
And then, I think that being immense,

840
00:28:04,033 --> 00:28:06,666
and honest and good friend,

841
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:07,566
and all of that

842
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:09,732
is something that is really really important.

843
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:12,732
For the company. For the culture.

844
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:13,666
And for me personally.

845
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:17,066
I love it. Assaf, thank you very very much.

846
00:28:17,067 --> 00:28:19,566
No, I can be happier

847
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:20,399
than having you on board.

848
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,732
This is fantastic

849
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:22,566
Bring us a lot more Michaels.

850
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,266
This is fantastic.

851
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:26,232
And I have to say that walking in here

852
00:28:26,233 --> 00:28:28,732
the culture, it precedes itself.

853
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:29,932
And yeah, the business is great.

854
00:28:29,933 --> 00:28:30,999
And technologies fantastic.

855
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,232
And I love the people around me.

856
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:34,966
The culture and the feeling that

857
00:28:34,967 --> 00:28:36,199
of what you've built here

858
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,699
over the 270 employees.

859
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,766
And I can’t wait to see it grow.

860
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:39,932
And continue to grow.

861
00:28:39,933 --> 00:28:41,232
And it's great to be part of the journey.

862
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:42,166
Thanks very much.

863
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:43,299
Thanks so much for that.

864
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:47,400
Thanks Michael.
