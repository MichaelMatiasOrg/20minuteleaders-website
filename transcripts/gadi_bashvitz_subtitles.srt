1
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,920
All right, Gadi Bashvitz,

2
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,000
thank you so much for joining me

3
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:02,960
on 20 Minute Leaders.

4
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:04,320
Thanks Michael.

5
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,280
Where are you calling from?

6
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,840
It looks like Meteora, Greece

7
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,800
but I think I'm wrong.

8
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:10,800
Actually,  the picture behind me

9
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,040
it's from Telluride, Colorado.

10
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,000
But I'm in Corte Madera.

11
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,280
So, eight miles north

12
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,040
from the Golden Gate Bridge right now.

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,920
Oh, you're eight miles

14
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,760
of the Golden Bridge. Wonderful

15
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,720
The picture is the picture I took over

16
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,920
July 4th, last weekend last year.

17
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,320
Last year. Wonderful.

18
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,120
Actually, I believe this episode

19
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,800
is gonna air sometime later on.

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,720
So maybe it will be

21
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,360
last weekend, July 4th.

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,080
We'll see.

23
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,440
Gadi, extensive experience

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,000
in the tech sector

25
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:43,240
from 8200 to your MBA at NYU,

26
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,600
leading the entrepreneurship segment there

27
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:49,080
going on to Verint.

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,880
VP at NICE.

29
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,280
Your own startup which you've already

30
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,080
co-founded before,

31
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,360
and now you're a part of NeuraLegion

32
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,480
another startup.

33
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,520
Take me through your journey

34
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,040
just a little bit.

35
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,040
Give me a brief of who is Gadi.

36
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,360
All right.

37
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,680
Happy having to start there.

38
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,400
Maybe I'll even start a bit earlier.

39
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:05,960
Wonderful.

40
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,600
Or that. I'm originally from Israel,

41
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,360
but I got to grow up

42
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,400
in a bunch of different countries.

43
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,520
Which always makes it fun.

44
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:16,080
That instilled the love of travel in me.

45
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,040
I've been to 110 countries.

46
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:19,800
Wait wait wait.

47
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,560
You've been to a 110 countries?

48
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,280
Okay, throw everything else

49
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,000
out the window.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,440
I just wanna talk about that.

51
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:27,280
What does it mean 110?

52
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,120
Since I stop travel,

53
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,040
it's funny because I was talking to

54
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,680
the one of our [--] yesterday

55
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,080
and he said,

56
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:32,760
"Yeah, I'd like to go to New Zealand."

57
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,440
And I started on the call

58
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,920
with the whole plan for him.

59
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,020
I'm like,

60
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,120
"Okay, this is what you need to do."

61
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,280
"You need to go there."

62
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,080
"This is how you do it."

63
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,440
"This is how you travel."

64
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,200
That's how I usually end up conversations.

65
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,760
I'm a travel agent

66
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:44,360
to anybody who knows me.

67
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,840
Gadi, this is incredible.

68
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,080
How do you get to 110 countries?

69
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,280
Well, a lot of it is

70
00:02:50,281 --> 00:02:52,360
growing up in Europe as a kid.

71
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,600
My parents used to throw us

72
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,480
in the back of the car

73
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,560
and just drive around.

74
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,280
So, I've been to about 30 countries

75
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,040
by the age of 10.

76
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,960
And then you just fall in love with it

77
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,400
and you find jobs over time

78
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,600
that let you travel

79
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,400
and go see a lot of other places.

80
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,320
So, in the period between,

81
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,520
we're getting a bit off topic

82
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,960
but I think that's okay.

83
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:19,040
In a period between 2001 and 2012,

84
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,320
I travelled 2.2 million miles

85
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,840
and visited about 70 different countries.

86
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,280
So, mostly for work, but I got to

87
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,120
extend that and have some fun.

88
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,960
Wow. Okay.

89
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,200
That's just incredible.

90
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,760
Going back to entrepreneurship,

91
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,880
but we're gonna continue,

92
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,200
we're continuing this

93
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,960
right after the recording.

94
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,640
Okay. Excellent.

95
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,000
So, started there.

96
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,080
I came back to Israel

97
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,600
after a few years in Europe.

98
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:48,600
8200, the customary plan

99
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,880
for anybody in cyber.

100
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,960
Then got my undergrad

101
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,640
at Tel Aviv University.

102
00:03:53,641 --> 00:03:56,200
And went in to join

103
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,120
this world of high tech.

104
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,960
Founded my first startup in '99

105
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,120
after my first company

106
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,000
that's acquired by NICE.

107
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:07,520
That's a very interesting time

108
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,000
to start a company.

109
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:09,920
It was a very,

110
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,120
actually it was a great time

111
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,920
to start a company.

112
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,440
And fortunately, two years later,

113
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,120
we have lost a great time

114
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,320
to raise a series A,

115
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:19,680
which is what we were in the midst of.

116
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,720
But things actually went pretty well

117
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,680
and we ended up selling the company.

118
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,880
It's a strange story.

119
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,560
We actually split it in two

120
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,440
and NICE acquired part of it

121
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,440
and Verint acquired another part.

122
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,120
And I went to one place

123
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,520
and my partner and co-founder

124
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,920
went to the other place.

125
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,240
Wow.

126
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:41,080
And that's how I joined there.

127
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,800
I was with them on the product side

128
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,640
for about a year and a half in Israel.

129
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,800
And then they moved me to the US

130
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,000
as part of the extension of the company.

131
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,620
And Verint was a fund run.

132
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,080
I was there for six years.

133
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,800
We went from 150 people

134
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,680
to 2500 people.

135
00:04:57,681 --> 00:04:59,520
We went public.

136
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:02,400
We went from about $15 million in sales

137
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,400
to $400 million in sales.

138
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,160
What was your role in the company

139
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,160
as you were watching this

140
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,600
incredible transition?

141
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,080
I was running product design

142
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,840
and the product management organization.

143
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,200
And then when I moved here,

144
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,920
I started the pre-sales group,

145
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,560
then a business consulting group

146
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,400
and then customer success.

147
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,880
I did some direct sales.

148
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,880
So,I got to see everything

149
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,560
from the front line.

150
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,560
It was very interesting to work

151
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,360
on a very large opportunity.

152
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,960
So, selling to, first of all,

153
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,840
the IRS here in the US, then AT&T,

154
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,080
T-Mobile, Sprint, some of the large banks,

155
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,520
working on deals anywhere from

156
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,760
$10 million to $40 million.

157
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,560
This is pre-tax.

158
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,200
So, that was an exciting period.

159
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,520
And I learned a lot.

160
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,320
In parallel,

161
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,520
what you brought up earlier

162
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,360
is I got my MBA at NYU.

163
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:53,600
Right.

164
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,040
That was my weekend job.

165
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,360
And around the Entrepreneurship Club.

166
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,120
for me to promote exchange,

167
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,760
Even though I was a part time student,

168
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,920
I really wanted to get involved.

169
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:05,920
Found an apartment

170
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,000
a block and a half away from Stern.

171
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,240
And that enabled me

172
00:06:10,241 --> 00:06:13,680
to really get involved there.

173
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,360
But alas, after six years

174
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,440
in the Verint company,

175
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:17,800
I got a bit too big

176
00:06:17,801 --> 00:06:19,480
after a big acquisition we did.

177
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,520
And I decided it was time to move on

178
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,200
and join a company called

179
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,680
Merced Systems here on the West Coast.

180
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,120
I moved at the end of 2007

181
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,240
to San Francisco.

182
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,040
I joined Merced pretty early on.

183
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,120
We were 25 people.

184
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,880
Something like that at the time.

185
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,200
Pretty small.

186
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,320
And when five years later

187
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,840
we were acquired by NICE.

188
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,560
The great thing about Merced is that

189
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,280
we only raised one round of funding.

190
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,840
We only raised

191
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,040
two and a half million dollars

192
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,040
and we were profitable from year two.

193
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,520
Oh my God. Wait. So, that was

194
00:06:53,521 --> 00:06:55,640
the second company you're involved with

195
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,720
that Nice was involved

196
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,440
in the acquisition, right?

197
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,560
Exactly.

198
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,440
Wow. Interesting. Coincidence?

199
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,120
It's all in the same space.

200
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,000
On the same space.

201
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,560
So, yes and no.

202
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,960
Interesting. Gadi, I wanna give time

203
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,240
to talk about cyber security

204
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,280
because this is also a sweet spot for me

205
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,560
after my own five years in 8200.

206
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:16,400
NeuraLegion.

207
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,240
I'm a part of J-Ventures.

208
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,360
So so proud to be a part of the fund

209
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,200
that helped invest in NeuraLegion.

210
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,080
Give me the pitch.

211
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,480
What is NeuraLegion?

212
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,000
Why is app security so prevalent

213
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,800
and so important in 2020?

214
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,600
Yeah, absolutely.

215
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,640
I think the key thing that we do,

216
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,200
or the key couple of things that we do

217
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,280
that are very different

218
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,160
and very innovative in the market is

219
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,160
we took the approach from the beginning.

220
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,680
From the time the company was created,

221
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:49,480
that we want to provide

222
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,440
a tool for developers.

223
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,320
We do not want to go

224
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,760
into the security organization

225
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,240
and tell them:

226
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,080
Here's the CYA tool

227
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,720
that you can go ahead and deploy.

228
00:07:58,721 --> 00:08:00,440
And say that it will work

229
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,160
and you get the report that you need.

230
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,480
No. We wanted to provide a tool

231
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,920
to companies that they can integrate

232
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,960
very early on into their

233
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,480
development processes and make sure

234
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,320
that developers are using it.

235
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,720
But that's the reason we called it

236
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,440
from building to compliance.

237
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:16,840
Right.

238
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,400
So, it can be deployed on every build.

239
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,640
But you can build on that

240
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,080
and go from that to say,

241
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:22,680
"Okay, I've secured the build.

242
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:24,360
Now, I've secured the application.

243
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,840
Now, I've secured the product.

244
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,040
And now I get my compliance reports.

245
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,800
And you do that all in one holistic way

246
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,160
across all of your environments.

247
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,280
So, you're not just testing

248
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:34,740
your application,

249
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,440
but you're testing your API,

250
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,640
which is critical today.

251
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,880
More and more organizations

252
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,960
are using that.

253
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,360
You're using and your testing

254
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,640
your mobile applications

255
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,960
and also, any modern technology

256
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,480
that you're using, like:

257
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,920
single page applications,

258
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,760
or authenticated sites,

259
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,240
or if you're into

260
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,400
micro services environment,

261
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,800
we can support all that.

262
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,920
Because we are inherently

263
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,840
built in the cloud

264
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,840
and we're not a legacy solution.

265
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,240
Talk to me a little bit about

266
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,400
how do you grow a company like this?

267
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,560
Fine. So, you have great talent.

268
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,640
You understand the space.

269
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,240
You write a great solution.

270
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,040
Now what?

271
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:06,920
So, you have yeah,

272
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,360
you have a million SAS products,

273
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,720
but you're knocking on the doors.

274
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,080
You're offering another security,

275
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,320
another layer.

276
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,920
How do you sell this thing?

277
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,400
I think the critical thing is,

278
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,880
one, you need to understand

279
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,680
how you're different

280
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,800
and where you're different.

281
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,040
And this actually ties

282
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,200
into your other question of

283
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,880
how do you grow

284
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,880
still growing company,

285
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,800
even though that's not the case here.

286
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,040
But the key thing is focus.

287
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,360
How do you understand,

288
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,040
where are the opportunities

289
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,880
that you can actually win.

290
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,240
What are the opportunities

291
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,480
that you can't win.

292
00:09:35,481 --> 00:09:37,000
And how to walk away

293
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,960
from the ones you can't win.

294
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,360
There's a lot of people,

295
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,280
at least the time of time and places

296
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,320
that ultimately will just waste their time

297
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,080
and they're not able to win.

298
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,440
But one of the things

299
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,640
and that's a critical thing

300
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,400
that I implemented

301
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,400
the minute I joined here

302
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,680
and many other companies, is,

303
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:54,920
we do not join a meeting

304
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,720
and do a demo of the first meeting, right?

305
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,960
All these companies join a meeting

306
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,840
and immediately start talking

307
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,000
at the customer.

308
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:02,880
Absolutely not.

309
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,800
Our first meeting is a discovery meeting.

310
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,280
You are going to talk to us

311
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,520
in the first meeting.

312
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,080
They will spend 15, 20 minutes

313
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,720
understanding what are

314
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,920
actual challenges are.

315
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,120
And once we know what they are

316
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,080
and then we'll come back, we'll prepare

317
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,480
and we'll present back to you.

318
00:10:17,481 --> 00:10:19,440
If we think that we can't help you,

319
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,320
we will tell you that on the first call.

320
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,000
So, we don't waste your time or our time,

321
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,760
because that's our most

322
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,200
sacred resource, it's the time.

323
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,720
Of course. And is this diverging

324
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,720
from the common way that

325
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,680
any SAS company operates today?

326
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,640
I think that modern sales organizations

327
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,360
know this and they do that.

328
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:42,720
But go to any website

329
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:44,240
that you have, right?

330
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,400
And click it.

331
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,280
What is the call to action that they have?

332
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,520
Request to demo.

333
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,280
No, I don't believe in that.

334
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,420
You can request a demo,

335
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,720
you're not gonna get one immediately.

336
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,160
Right?

337
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,680
It's how you catch your people

338
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,760
and how you get them.

339
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,400
So, I think that

340
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,000
modern sales organizations

341
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,640
absolutely understand this.

342
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,200
I did not invent the concept

343
00:11:03,201 --> 00:11:05,080
of asks questions first,

344
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,400
and learn and then adapt.

345
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,640
But it's something

346
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,000
that a lot of people get wrong

347
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:13,000
and that's how you get started.

348
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,920
Then you actually need

349
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,200
to have a superior product.

350
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,400
You need to be able to go off in POCs

351
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:19,400
and beat anybody in the competition.

352
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,960
I'm happy to say that we've done

353
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:23,520
20, 25 POCs in the last four months

354
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,760
and we've never lost.

355
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,120
We beat each and every one of them.

356
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,640
That's why we've invested.

357
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,480
That's why we're so proud.

358
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,240
Well, you invested

359
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:32,680
before these four months.

360
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,400
Yeah. Hopefully we'll follow on

361
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:35,960
[--]

362
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,080
We'll see major way.

363
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:37,360
By the time this airs,

364
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:39,560
To follow on will be bad.

365
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,280
Isn't this the role

366
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,120
of the investors, though,

367
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,160
to always then say,

368
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,360
"Yeah, I knew this before."

369
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,520
and that's how you're in?

370
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,080
All right. Gadi, one of the things

371
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,560
that we talked about right before starting

372
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,800
is this notion of,

373
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,280
taking a large company

374
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,440
or a large organization

375
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,280
and that is slowly growing

376
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,200
and understanding

377
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,280
how can we pivot to scale

378
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,680
so that we can go much quicker

379
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,600
than we can.

380
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,080
You had experience doublings,

381
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,520
sometimes the sales in like

382
00:12:05,521 --> 00:12:07,960
periods of 18 months, which is incredible.

383
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,800
Talk to me a little bit about this notion.

384
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,840
What makes a company grow slow?

385
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,280
And what makes a company grow fast?

386
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,840
Yeah, I think it's touching on somebody

387
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,800
you already,

388
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,480
something we already talked about.

389
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,120
The key thing is what are the levers

390
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,800
that you can pull?

391
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,720
What do you need to stop doing?

392
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,560
First thing that you need

393
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,200
to understand is,

394
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,120
what do I need to stop doing?

395
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,680
I love it.

396
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,400
What am I doing that's just wasting time?

397
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,880
Okay, and I should not be doing

398
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,920
because even if I do it,

399
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,200
it won't help us grow, right?

400
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,000
And that's a critical, critical thing.

401
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,000
Once you understand

402
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,920
what you need to stop doing,

403
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,000
you need to understand

404
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,240
what are the levers that you can pull.

405
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,160
And really, there are few levers

406
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,680
in the area of sales that you can pull.

407
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,840
One is you can increase

408
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,840
your average contract value.

409
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,880
That's a very big one.

410
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,640
You need to understand

411
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,520
how do you do that.

412
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,040
You need to change your pricing models.

413
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,160
You need to change your go-to market.

414
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,520
You need to change the customer

415
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,160
you're selling to.

416
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,880
And you need to update

417
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,320
how you package the product, etc.

418
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,160
Right. That's one critical thing.

419
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,120
The next thing is,

420
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,120
can you change your sales cycle?

421
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,120
That there's something you're doing

422
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,160
in your sales cycle

423
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,120
that is preventing you from going faster.

424
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,520
And you have the ability

425
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,320
to now shorten that sales cycle

426
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,960
and have more impact.

427
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,720
The third one is,

428
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,520
how are you actually going to market?

429
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,120
Right. Are you going direct?

430
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,560
And are you having meetings in person?

431
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,520
This whole covid thing

432
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
that happened right now

433
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,000
is really teaching us that,

434
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,480
yes, you can do enterprise sales over Zoom

435
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,600
because somehow we've all

436
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,000
gotten comfortable doing that.

437
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,520
That's not something that organizations

438
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,520
were receiving or admitting

439
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,600
that can be done earlier.

440
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,000
But maybe that's the change.

441
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But I was just having,

442
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:53,880
I was having coffee with a good friend

443
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,440
from the Stanford Business School.

444
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,120
And one of the things

445
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,280
he was telling me is,

446
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,800
You know, Michael,

447
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,480
one of the things that is happening,

448
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,360
a lot of really great salespeople,

449
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,760
it's not just about the demo

450
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,400
and about sitting

451
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,680
and about talking.

452
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,880
It's about the whole experience.

453
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,560
It's coming in.

454
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,760
Maybe going for a nice lunch

455
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,080
getting to know the other person.

456
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,840
Critical.

457
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,320
Well, you can't do that anymore.

458
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,920
Now, I can be sitting

459
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,800
in my underwear right now.

460
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,520
We don't know.

461
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,280
This is a whole different conversation.

462
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,880
I'm not in my underwear, just,

463
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:26,720
[--]

464
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,840
I think it is an interesting ride

465
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,880
because I have done

466
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,600
this huge enterprise sales

467
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,360
where in the end,

468
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,960
people buy from people, right?

469
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,560
And that is a very important component.

470
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:39,400
There are circumstances right now

471
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,320
that have changed that.

472
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,960
Do I think that ultimately

473
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,520
when this whole covid thing is over,

474
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,680
we will not revert a bit towards,

475
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,880
yes, still establishing relationships

476
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,480
and still having a drink together

477
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,000
for large enterprise deals

478
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,400
and still forming relationships

479
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,160
Absolutely not.

480
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,280
That is going to come back.

481
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,360
And quite frankly, it's one of the parts

482
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,320
of the job that I like.

483
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,880
So, it would be sad,

484
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,800
being a traveler

485
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,280
and love meeting people totally,

486
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,000
I love that.

487
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,760
All right.

488
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,440
It would be sad if that went away.

489
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,040
I don't believe it will.

490
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,280
But definitely you're learning

491
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,920
what kinds of opportunities

492
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,480
do not require that.

493
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,040
Amazing.

494
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,960
And how to differentiate between the two.

495
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,400
Why come back to early stage startups?

496
00:15:21,401 --> 00:15:23,960
I'd say there are,

497
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,480
well, I was, I never left, really.

498
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,560
Apart from Verint,

499
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,240
which was a more mature company.

500
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,760
I always go back.

501
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,480
But you're also VP at NICE.

502
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,520
You're also a VP.

503
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,520
But that was both acquisition.

504
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:37,920
Okay.

505
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,520
So, I was there post acquisition

506
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,440
and helping the transition, etc.

507
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,600
So, I constantly come back

508
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,920
to early stage startups.

509
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,640
At some point,

510
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,720
I will stop doing that

511
00:15:49,721 --> 00:15:53,840
because it is very very hard work.

512
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,640
But I would say for me, it's three things.

513
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,560
One, is really having the ability

514
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,840
to make an impact.

515
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,280
And at earlier stages,

516
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,480
every step that you do

517
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,480
has much more significant impact.

518
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,400
Right.

519
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,840
And that's one thing I love.

520
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,640
Two, in the case of NeuraLegion,

521
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,720
it was really going back to the origins.

522
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,720
I started in cybersecurity.

523
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,240
I thought it was time to go back to it.

524
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,600
I understand this market

525
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,120
and I really saw an opportunity

526
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:21,680
I can provide value.

527
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,000
And three, there were,

528
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,760
quite frankly, threats on my life.

529
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,560
One of my CEO is been my best friend

530
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,640
for 40 years,

531
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,920
and he told me that it was time for me

532
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,080
to come back and start working together.

533
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,400
How many opportunities do you get

534
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,640
to work with your best friend?

535
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,680
That's incredible.

536
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,080
That's just incredible.

537
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,440
You know, talk to me a little bit about

538
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,160
the cyber security space.

539
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,440
Where are we headed?

540
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,960
What are some of the greatest challenges

541
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,920
in this space as a whole,

542
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,280
not just NeuraLegion,

543
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,800
but the space as a whole

544
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:51,680
that you're seeing now as you're talking

545
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,240
to so many different companies

546
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:56,240
who are in need of cyber solutions?

547
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,520
Well, I think the market

548
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,480
is really shifting.

549
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,720
And it's shifted much more significantly

550
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,200
over the last three months

551
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,720
than people expected.

552
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,480
But this just pushed a lot of trends

553
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,160
that had already started.

554
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,160
The number of threats is

555
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,800
going up continuously, right?

556
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:11,750
It never stop.

557
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,280
And organizations are facing

558
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,480
new and more dangerous threats

559
00:17:16,481 --> 00:17:17,480
all the time.

560
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:19,520
Now, especially with everybody

561
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,240
working from home, the whole,

562
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,400
would you believe three months ago

563
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,560
if I told you that VPN

564
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:25,720
is going to disappear

565
00:17:25,721 --> 00:17:27,040
and there are new solutions

566
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,240
that will replace VPN.

567
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,760
We've been playing around with VPN

568
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,400
for 25 years now, right?

569
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,310
Unbelievable.

570
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,270
So, that's going away.

571
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,830
And there is a huge change.

572
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,720
And I think one of the biggest trends

573
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:39,840
that we're seeing is that,

574
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,280
really the world of software

575
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,350
is eating everything, right?

576
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,750
By Marc Andreessen. Yeah.

577
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,640
Software is eating the world.

578
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,920
Exactly. Right.

579
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,280
And now, that's coming

580
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,310
to security as well.

581
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,520
You can't have

582
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,040
two different organizations.

583
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,680
Now,  we're the security organization

584
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,400
that enforces up the development we're

585
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,240
gonna let you know.

586
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,030
That's wrong. Right?

587
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,800
They are one organization now.

588
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,400
And if you can't have security

589
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,200
from the ground up,

590
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,920
you're going to have a problem.

591
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,360
And we're seeing that in every single page

592
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,680
of every single part of cyber security.

593
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,320
And really, there is a great thing

594
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,480
in English which everybody knows, which is

595
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,720
"An ounce of prevention

596
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,000
is worth a pound of cure."

597
00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:21,040
And integrating all these solutions

598
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,400
into the development process,

599
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,160
is that ounce of prevention.

600
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,480
It will save organizations a lot of money

601
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,640
and make them a lot more secure by design.

602
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,800
And that's exactly what

603
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,030
we're trying to help drive.

604
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,280
But it's not enough for any young company

605
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,240
to just come in and say,

606
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,510
"Yeah, we have a software."

607
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,880
Neuralegion and the few others

608
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,270
come along and integrate.

609
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,960
Let's be secure.

610
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:47,400
Are the companies as early as a POC

611
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,720
or an MVP,

612
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,400
do they already need somebody

613
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,400
who is knowledgeable with

614
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:53,040
cybersecurity space within the company?

615
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,360
Or do you think this can be outsourced

616
00:18:55,361 --> 00:18:58,560
and just plug in installations

617
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,790
from other companies?

618
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,760
So, I think there are three options

619
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,270
that organizations can look at.

620
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,280
Because the threat profile is different

621
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,200
from different kinds of organization.

622
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,560
For a large and mature organization

623
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:13,480
and your Visa or your Citibank

624
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,000
or your government, you know

625
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,040
that there are a lot of people

626
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,310
that are excited to attack you.

627
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,000
So, you better have this in place

628
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,520
and you better have real experts in place

629
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,180
that are dynamic

630
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,600
and thinking on their feet

631
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,310
and know what they're doing.

632
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,480
If you're a midsize organization

633
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,960
that's developing a solution, etc,

634
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:37,720
or a very early stage company,

635
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,840
absolutely adapt these practices

636
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,280
they are the right practices

637
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,510
from the beginning.

638
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,480
Integrate them into your processes.

639
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,560
But you can use

640
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,270
third party tools for this.

641
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,160
The third approach,

642
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,200
which we're definitely seeing is

643
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,720
there are outsource companies

644
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,880
that help you with it.

645
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,000
And maybe it's taking a hybrid approach

646
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,880
in the first of the latter two

647
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:01,440
in order to really get secure as you grow.

648
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,440
I love it. Gadi, right before we leave,

649
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,040
and thank you again

650
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,440
for the time inspiration.

651
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,000
And I'm excited to continue learning

652
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,920
as much as I can from you along the way.

653
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,240
I need three words from you

654
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,560
that best describe you

655
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:13,080
and a little bit about

656
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,590
what are you truly passionate about?

657
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,040
Yeah. It's always a question

658
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
when you get asked this.

659
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,080
Is that how others would describe me

660
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,440
or how I'm going to describe myself?

661
00:20:24,441 --> 00:20:26,240
I'm gonna let you choose which one.

662
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,980
I'll go with, and also, when I say others,

663
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,880
as my co-worker and my wife.

664
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:33,960
Who's the one that,

665
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,480
if the dog, then it's treat dispenser.

666
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,760
And that's as far as I go.

667
00:20:39,761 --> 00:20:44,280
I would say Unconventional.

668
00:20:44,281 --> 00:20:46,360
I don't necessarily do things

669
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,600
in the standard way

670
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:51,920
that they would be done otherwise.

671
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:52,830
Tenacious.

672
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,680
Okay. I like that.

673
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,360
And the one that I've heard of

674
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,000
time and time again that I like

675
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,440
is the GST. Get shit done.

676
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,720
I love it. Yes.

677
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,440
Talk is cheap.

678
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:06,800
Wonderful.

679
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Gadi, toda raba.

680
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,400
Thank you very very much.

681
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,000
And best of luck with everything.

682
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:13,400
[--]

683
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,880
Thank you very much.

684
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:16,040
Talk to you very soon. Bye bye.
