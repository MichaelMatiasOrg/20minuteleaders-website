1
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,720
Tal Tochner, thank you for joining me

2
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,520
in 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,560
How are you?

4
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,480
I'm great.

5
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,680
I'm really excited to be here.

6
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,040
Thank you so much for having me.

7
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,960
Well, I'm really excited

8
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,480
that you are here.

9
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,240
So, where are you calling from right now?

10
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,440
I'm calling from our office in Tel Aviv.

11
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,400
Okay. The PICO offices.

12
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,720
The PICO offices, that's right.

13
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,880
Wonderful. Wonderful. Okay.

14
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,320
Well, I'm glad to see that things

15
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,360
are still happening there,

16
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,440
even though the situation is so dire.

17
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,040
But hopefully, by the time this airs,

18
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,360
it'll die down a bit

19
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,840
and things will get a little bit better.

20
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,840
First, I want to talk about

21
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,840
morning dance parties.

22
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,720
What is that all about?

23
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,520
Oh, my goodness.

24
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,560
So, I have an incredible morning routine

25
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,760
that includes writing and gratitude,

26
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,040
and meditations, and a bit of yoga.

27
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,960
But my favorite part is relax in the music

28
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,520
that wakes up all my neighbors super early

29
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,720
and just dancing that off the wall.

30
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,760
I love it. I love it. Okay.

31
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,400
I've been trying to get

32
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,800
into morning routine myself, but I,

33
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,040
and everybody's been telling me

34
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,240
about the meditation

35
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,960
and gratitude part.

36
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,880
I think that I'm going to start

37
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,760
by adopting this morning dance party.

38
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,240
And then move on to those

39
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,520
because that seems like

40
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,150
a really nice part of it.

41
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,160
Tal, I'm going to let you

42
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,240
talk a little bit about your journey.

43
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,040
Because I'm not going to be able

44
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,840
to do justice.

45
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,480
But just a small recap.

46
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,640
Currently, an investor within PICO,

47
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,960
you are also a Forbes 30 under 30,

48
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,360
founded several organizations,

49
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,760
WMN, part of them.

50
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,240
But you also did a lot of other work

51
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,680
in terms of female empowerment

52
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,960
and leadership globally,

53
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,880
not just in tech.

54
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,600
And I'd love to actually

55
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,720
get started with that in just a second.

56
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,160
And then weave the conversation

57
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,920
into how you invest within PICO,

58
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,040
and what do you bring to the table

59
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,600
for the both portfolio companies,

60
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,160
but also a part of your investment thesis.

61
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,680
So, Tal, take us away.

62
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,400
Talk to me a little bit

63
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,080
about your journey.

64
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,920
Where you're from,

65
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,480
and how you got to where you are?

66
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,200
Amazing.

67
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,640
So, I was born and raised in the US.

68
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,000
In Newark, New Jersey.

69
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,520
I moved to Israel when I was about 16.

70
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,840
And I've been here ever since.

71
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,480
Did spent some time in the army.

72
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,560
Went to Hebrew University.

73
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,920
And was, to be honest with you,

74
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,760
I've wanted always to be a diplomat.

75
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,920
And from that dream, somehow,

76
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,440
I became a venture capitalist.

77
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,240
A little bit different.

78
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,200
A little different, but much of the same.

79
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,840
What is the same between being a diplomat

80
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,800
and being a venture capitalist?

81
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,680
I'm really passionate about Israel

82
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,640
and telling Israel's phenomenal story.

83
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,560
So, as a venture capitalist,

84
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,760
I get the opportunity to tell

85
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,360
the economic phenomenal story

86
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,000
and not the side of a political one.

87
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,920
And I feel like that brings

88
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
a lot of great things together.

89
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,560
Okay. And so, growing up

90
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,560
to become a diplomat,

91
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,360
what does that entail?

92
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,960
Is that like model United Nations

93
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,840
and that sort of stuff?

94
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,640
How do you set yourself up

95
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,720
to become a diplomat

96
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,880
and then make that rapid transition

97
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,680
into venture capital?

98
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,440
So, I took to learn lot of

99
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,600
international and global

100
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
learning experiences and conferences.

101
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,000
Whether it was the model UN,

102
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,960
whether it was international diplomacy,

103
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,880
peace building, humanitarian aid.

104
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,640
I was traveling around the world

105
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,400
and taking part

106
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,480
in unique learning experiences

107
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,280
in order to acquire the soft skills

108
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,400
that will help me succeed.

109
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,640
And the learning experiences

110
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,280
that will helped me

111
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,920
become better professionally.

112
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,400
And when I started university,

113
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,880
I set out to study

114
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,040
Chinese and international relations

115
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,200
because I thought that would position me

116
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,760
in a very unique way

117
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,320
to go into foreign service.

118
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,440
Because not many people speak Chinese,

119
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,400
definitely not about [--].

120
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,280
And it's more relevant than ever.

121
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,520
More relevant than ever.

122
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,120
And that actually took me

123
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,200
to the business side,

124
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,920
and not the diplomatic side,

125
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,360
which is surprising.

126
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,600
And I'm extremely grateful

127
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,800
and happy about that.

128
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,640
So, what was your first dip

129
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,000
into the business side of things

130
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,760
out of the diplomacy side?

131
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,640
So, towards the end of my first year

132
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,160
of university,

133
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,120
I decided to intern for an incredible CEO,

134
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,120
Rebecca Zeffert at the Israel Asia Center.

135
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,720
Which is an incredible organization

136
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,360
that basically fosters collaborations

137
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,520
between Israel

138
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,000
and all countries around Asia.

139
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,880
Specifically around economic ties.

140
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,480
And that basically was my entry point

141
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,000
to the entire startup ecosystem

142
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,960
here in Israel.

143
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,000
I was hosting

144
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,680
high level senior delegations

145
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,840
of investors and entrepreneurs

146
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,840
and government officials

147
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,880
and connecting them

148
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,960
to the localized system here.

149
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,960
Were you able to use any of the Chinese

150
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,120
you learned in university,

151
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,240
or was that not even a part of it?

152
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,960
My Chinese is not as good

153
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,720
as I hoped it would be.

154
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,640
Very very nice.

155
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,800
Okay. Now talk to me a little bit

156
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,040
about this thing that you founded,

157
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,200
which you're empowering female leaders,

158
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,480
not necessarily in tech,

159
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,880
but in all sectors.

160
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,480
And you're doing it in a pretty cool way.

161
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,360
So, tell me a little bit about

162
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,720
what that program was about

163
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,000
and then we'll transition

164
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,240
to some of the investments.

165
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,720
About five years ago,

166
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,320
I co-founded an organization

167
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,040
called the Women's Parliament,

168
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,000
that really fosters female leadership

169
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,080
across the board, all over Israel.

170
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,240
And for me personally,

171
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,520
it was extremely important to invest

172
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,880
in mid to senior leadership.

173
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,920
But also showcase the various,

174
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,920
Israel's extremely unique, right?

175
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,680
We have a lot of

176
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,840
different sectors and societies.

177
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,040
And I wanted to make sure

178
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,760
that we have everyone there

179
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,040
as a whole.

180
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,480
So, we have women that

181
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,000
from the public sector,

182
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,200
from the private sector,

183
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,280
from non-profits,

184
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,000
from all across Israel,

185
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,360
from south to north.

186
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,960
We have Haredi women,

187
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,480
we have Arab women,

188
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,400
we have Olean, new immigrants.

189
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,880
And this program really sets out

190
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,000
to help them acquire skill sets

191
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,080
that they're going to need in order

192
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,920
to become the future leaders of Israel.

193
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,640
Now, what does that

194
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,000
actually mean tangibly?

195
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,400
So then, you join this program,

196
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,800
you identify these women,

197
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,120
what do you actually do with them

198
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,400
to make that leap?

199
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,800
So, we have meetings every so often

200
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,080
with either thought leaders

201
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,960
or entrepreneurs or government leaders

202
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,920
that tell their personal stories,

203
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,760
but also give them help.

204
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,520
Also provide a practical skill

205
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,520
that these females can use

206
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,000
within their own organizations.

207
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,800
And through that,

208
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,360
we also foster relationships

209
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,400
and mentorship,

210
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,920
and friendships amongst the women

211
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,920
that to really help them increase

212
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,200
their network in order to succeed.

213
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,840
So, when I looked at my own network,

214
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,120
I said,

215
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,760
"Okay. I'm very much in high tech,

216
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,240
in a startup ecosystem."

217
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,160
I don't know anything else around me.

218
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,440
Definitely not at the time, right?

219
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,440
And if I want to succeed

220
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,480
in a really meaningful way,

221
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,920
I need to establish

222
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,240
a much broader network.

223
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,160
And that's how this came to be.

224
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,920
And that's what was so important for us.

225
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,640
To bring in women

226
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,480
that really depict all of Israel's society

227
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,120
from all different sectors.

228
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,160
And there have been a lot of

229
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,600
really great outcomes and friendships

230
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,880
and collaborations that have come

231
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,240
out of this incredible form.

232
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,600
And so, are there any common threads

233
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,240
that you've noticed among the members

234
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,880
in this program where

235
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,920
there are specific things

236
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,040
that collectively they need

237
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,160
or collectively are looking for

238
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,240
as they join this program

239
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,200
and are making the leap?

240
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:30,320
Yes. I think women as a whole

241
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,920
have a lot of challenges

242
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,760
as they step up from mid-level,

243
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,760
to senior level to executives.

244
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,600
And there's a lot that always happens

245
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,000
around negotiation skills

246
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,600
a lot about internal politics,

247
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,360
a lot about management, right?

248
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,360
When you move from mid-level

249
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,400
to senior level,

250
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,600
and how do you manage a team,

251
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,280
and how do you manage

252
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,640
the time effectively.

253
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,400
A lot about productivity,

254
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,800
a lot about facilitation of relationships

255
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,280
and strategic partnerships.

256
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,880
Those are things that are common threads

257
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,280
that across the industries

258
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,320
you deal with on a day to day level.

259
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,400
And was it helpful

260
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
that this is a community

261
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,960
that is strictly for women

262
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,000
in terms of their empowerment?

263
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,360
Because all of these skills

264
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,400
are hugely relevant

265
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,360
to both genders, right?

266
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,120
But I'm trying to assess whether

267
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,600
the fact that it's a community

268
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,200
that it's by women for women,

269
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,000
gives them a little bit more flexibility

270
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,960
and more confidence

271
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,960
to go and utilize them.

272
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,520
100%. I think that it provides

273
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,320
a really strong foundation

274
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,520
where you're not afraid

275
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,440
to raise your hands and ask the question.

276
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,200
Where you don't feel

277
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,080
like you're constantly being judged.

278
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,360
Where you can really come and be yourself,

279
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,560
and be your authentic self.

280
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,440
And really create

281
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,120
those meaningful relationships that will

282
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,360
really help you take yourself

283
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,520
to the next level.

284
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,120
Wonderful.

285
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,480
Okay, Tal, so you forwent

286
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,760
your passion for diplomacy

287
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,080
to go into investing.

288
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,320
Today you're at PICO.

289
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,560
You've had a couple of other gigs

290
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,600
with investing before.

291
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,040
Talk to me a little bit about investing.

292
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,600
What is investing for you?

293
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,240
And what do you do specifically at PICO

294
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,280
that you're so excited about?

295
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,520
So, at PICO Partners,

296
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,400
I have an incredible opportunity

297
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,960
to really work with founders.

298
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,560
We're really early stage fund.

299
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,400
So, where normally the first

300
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,680
institutional money in the company.

301
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,040
So, sometimes we invest really

302
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,480
at the idea phase.

303
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,080
So, I get to work with entrepreneurs

304
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,400
from in idea and presentation

305
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,080
and help them build companies.

306
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,720
And that's something

307
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,240
that's so exciting for me.

308
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,160
Everything from the ideation,

309
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,160
to the productization

310
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,640
to the go to market strategy,

311
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,560
to hiring and business development

312
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,440
and setting up shop in a global country.

313
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,200
It's an incredible, it's something

314
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,680
that gets me really excited

315
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,880
to wake up every day to do.

316
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
So, walk me through your day to day.

317
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,080
You arrive in the morning,

318
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,280
or you're in the beginning of the week

319
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,400
at PICO Partners,

320
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
and what is the day in the life

321
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,000
of Tal Tochner look like?

322
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,120
Every day is different.

323
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,560
There is no common thread.

324
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,920
I spend a lot of time

325
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,560
meeting with entrepreneurs

326
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,520
and learning about new industries

327
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,360
and understanding whether,

328
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,600
hearing a lot of pitches

329
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,920
and trying to think whether

330
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,680
these are valuable businesses

331
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,000
and scalable businesses

332
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,720
that fit our investment thesis.

333
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,840
And a big part of my work also

334
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
goes to actually working

335
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,640
with the entrepreneurs

336
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,440
that I invested in

337
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,800
on their daily challenges.

338
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,840
Making sure that,

339
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,520
we're going through really rough times

340
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,400
all around the world,

341
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,400
corona, covid-19 has really impacted

342
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,320
a lot of businesses

343
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,600
and a lot of markets globally.

344
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,720
And I want to be my entrepreneur's

345
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,680
biggest cheerleader.

346
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,600
And I want to make sure

347
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,280
that they have what it takes.

348
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,800
And I can be helpful for them

349
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,160
to make it through successfully.

350
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,360
And sometimes that entails

351
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,320
working with them on hiring

352
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,680
and refining their value proposition

353
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,440
or their go to market strategy,

354
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,560
doing some market research.

355
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,320
And I do a lot of work

356
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,280
with the entrepreneurs

357
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,960
in all of those things.

358
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,440
So, how does that actually

359
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,280
the process start?

360
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,800
Because the way that I'm looking at this,

361
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,720
especially in the very very early stage,

362
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,200
so, let's say the ideation phase,

363
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,600
the entrepreneur has become

364
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
really experts in this domain.

365
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,480
They become truly passionate about this.

366
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,800
What is your role

367
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,120
as the institutional fund

368
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,800
that comes in and supports them

369
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,320
into helping them encapsulate

370
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,640
this ideation into a product, hire,

371
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,280
follow on to their future investments?

372
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,080
How do you actually go

373
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,640
and follow these entrepreneurs?

374
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,720
Is it, do you have a set things

375
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,920
that you expect them to do,

376
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,320
or you expect yourself to do?

377
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,880
Or is it more dynamic for entrepreneur?

378
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,160
It's very dynamic for entrepreneur.

379
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,040
I think different entrepreneurs

380
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,560
value many different things.

381
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,440
But ultimately,

382
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,080
I will never know better sector,

383
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,800
or a specific technology

384
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,320
better than the entrepreneur that's there

385
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,560
and working day to day.

386
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,000
But I do have an incredible benchmark,

387
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,440
having seen a lot of different companies,

388
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,280
a lot of different scenarios.

389
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,080
Researching a lot of different markets

390
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,440
that I can come from

391
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,980
with an outside view and be,

392
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,400
Hey, what do you think about that?

393
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,120
Hey, this worked well with this company.

394
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,480
Why don't you think of utilizing this

395
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,600
for you in this case as well?

396
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,720
And that's I think,

397
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,800
where venture capitalists

398
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,100
can be real value added

399
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,800
and helpful to the entrepreneurs.

400
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,720
Okay. And is there a specific market

401
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,080
that you're particularly excited about?

402
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,640
Or, is that very agnostic?

403
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,680
Oh, wow.

404
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,440
So, I'm very generalist

405
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,320
and I'm very agnostic.

406
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,720
But I'm extremely passionate

407
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,840
about the future of work.

408
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,320
Digital health space

409
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,240
is something I'm looking

410
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,240
a lot into right now.

411
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,040
Deep tech I'm really excited about.

412
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,720
Those are things

413
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,640
that I'm really deep diving on.

414
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,280
But I look at a lot of different sectors.

415
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,600
So, give me a couple of insights

416
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,240
into this idea of digital health,

417
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,560
the future of the workplace.

418
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,160
Because obviously that's something that's

419
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,720
hugely relevant to myself,

420
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,140
to anybody that's listening on the show,

421
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,000
to any entrepreneur

422
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,400
that is starting out their journey.

423
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,680
What are some of the trends

424
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,480
that you've been seeing

425
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,640
over the past few months?

426
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,440
And if I ask you, Tal, what do you think

427
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,840
are the key cornerstones,

428
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,560
or key milestones as we move along

429
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,400
in this new reality?

430
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,560
When I look at the future of work,

431
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,920
the way we're working is likely

432
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,560
to fundamentally change.

433
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,440
We're now getting used

434
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,360
to working remotely.

435
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,120
What does that mean?

436
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,200
How do you manage teams effectively?

437
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,440
How do you secure the network?

438
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,320
Think about all these

439
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,600
heavy enterprises that are on print,

440
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,760
how do you move employees

441
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,040
effectively work from home.

442
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,920
Connectivity. We spoke about communication

443
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,680
between teams, building culture,

444
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,720
all of that.

445
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,320
There's so much opportunity and things

446
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,040
that are going to have to change

447
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,840
in our day to day.

448
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,920
Right. No no. Go ahead.

449
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,800
When I think about digital health,

450
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,440
is global pandemic really pause

451
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,920
a lot of opportunities for companies

452
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,480
to really disrupt remote care.

453
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,000
We see telemedicine right now booming.

454
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,960
How do you,

455
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,160
and I think right now

456
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,000
consumers are used to getting

457
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,600
a lot of their services remotely.

458
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,560
And I think that's something

459
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,760
that's going to be very hard

460
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,160
to go back to the old days.

461
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,960
So, I think right now,

462
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,440
when I look at hospitals

463
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,600
and I look at clinics,

464
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,960
and I look at private practices

465
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,400
and I look at the payers

466
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,720
and they're going to have to do

467
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,160
a lot of work to transition.

468
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,840
And in order to stay relevant

469
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,680
and keep up with the trend

470
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,600
and what consumers are expecting to have.

471
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,680
So, what's important for you

472
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,920
when you meet an entrepreneur

473
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,320
and you're considering joining them

474
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:27,880
on the journey?

475
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,880
What sort of like your thesis into,

476
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,640
these are things that I'm excited about

477
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,480
and that I trust,

478
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:32,960
these are things

479
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,680
that I'm a little bit more worried about?

480
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,160
And obviously,

481
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,160
this is something that would go a long way

482
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,840
for any young entrepreneur watching us.

483
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,440
So, as an early stage investor,

484
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,320
the thing I look at

485
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,560
and spend the most time on

486
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,720
is the team.

487
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,960
Why did they choose to go after this,

488
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,880
this specific industry or problem?

489
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,920
Why are they best positioned to solve it?

490
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,320
What are they most passionate about?

491
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,560
What's the purpose behind

492
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,200
what they're doing?

493
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,320
And I think you would know, right?

494
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,600
Founding a startup

495
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,560
and being an entrepreneur,

496
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,400
is something that's extremely difficult.

497
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,320
The cycles of the success

498
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,240
are never linear.

499
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,040
There are always loops.

500
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,640
And you need to have a lot of resilience

501
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,420
and a lot of great endurance

502
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,440
in order to succeed.

503
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,640
And you need to be very mission driven.

504
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,600
And so, that's something

505
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,480
that I spend a lot of time on.

506
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,080
And again, I personally am excited about

507
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,440
things that are going to change

508
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,640
the way we live,

509
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,640
the way we consume things,

510
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,760
the way we operate,

511
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,800
that will impact our lives.

512
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,400
And also, on the other hand,

513
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,320
operational efficiency,

514
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,680
innovative business models.

515
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,280
Fixing broken business processes

516
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,160
in old industries,

517
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,400
which is what's exciting for me

518
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,640
in digital health, for instance.

519
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,600
So, I look on the team

520
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,080
and the market opportunity primarily.

521
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,800
So, one of the things

522
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,000
that I'm always very excited about

523
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,280
and we're very interested in is

524
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,640
how different institutions

525
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,880
come into a startup

526
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,400
and now have to play

527
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,200
a similar role, different role,

528
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,680
depending on the round that they join.

529
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,360
How do you, as an investor,

530
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,000
come in and see this relationship

531
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,440
also with other investors

532
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,840
who come into the startup?

533
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,760
Whether at your stage,

534
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,560
or a different round,

535
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,360
and all of a sudden now

536
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,000
you have sometimes conflicting ideas,

537
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,320
conflicting strategies,

538
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,480
obviously beyond the entrepreneur

539
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,120
directs the path.

540
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,880
But how do you then create this harmony

541
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,040
between the different

542
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,160
institutional investors within a startup?

543
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,520
It's something that sometimes

544
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,360
is hard to do,

545
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,160
and it's sometimes challenging

546
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,920
and often great.

547
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,200
We all have a shared interest,

548
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,840
which is the success of the company.

549
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,400
And we're all there to be

550
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,680
the company's greatest cheerleader.

551
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,920
And ultimately,

552
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,440
we might have different ideas.

553
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,600
But I think our job as investors

554
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
is to ask the right questions

555
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,800
and the challenging questions.

556
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,160
And to get the entrepreneur

557
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,840
to think of it outside the box

558
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,920
or even take the opportunity

559
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,400
to reflect, like in board meetings.

560
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,200
You take an opportunity to reflect

561
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,160
three months back

562
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,080
and look three months,

563
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,520
six months, two years forward

564
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,200
and really plan and strategize.

565
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,080
And that's where I think

566
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,080
we can be most helpful.

567
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,840
And I think where

568
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,480
we all have a common thread.

569
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,320
And when you say, "we",

570
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,400
you're meaning yourselves and the other

571
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,960
institutional investors, right?

572
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,280
Yes. Us and any other investors

573
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,280
around the [--].

574
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,740
Very very very cool.

575
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,520
Tal, right before we get

576
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,040
to my favorite question,

577
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,160
what is the one thing

578
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,440
that's the most exciting for you

579
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,000
in this whole journey?

580
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,600
Whether it's  meeting the entrepreneurs

581
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,600
or watching different industries

582
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,680
in different markets, boom.

583
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,720
What is really the most exciting for you

584
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,320
about being an investor?

585
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,120
Because you did have ambitions

586
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,080
to go into other sectors,

587
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,320
but obviously you're having so much fun

588
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,120
what are you doing now.

589
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,720
I feel so grateful to be the enabler

590
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,600
and to help entrepreneurs

591
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,640
fulfill their dreams.

592
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,960
I think it's an incredible opportunity

593
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,640
and it's what wakes me up

594
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,640
and keeps me excited every day.

595
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,520
I love it. I love it.

596
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,280
Okay, and three words that you would use

597
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,360
to describe yourself.

598
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,560
Execution driven.

599
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,720
Authentic.

600
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,480
And resilient.

601
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:08,880
Okay.

602
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,200
Explain a little bit more about these.

603
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,120
Why these three words?

604
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,720
So, I'm extremely execution driven.

605
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,520
I know how to take a lot of ideas

606
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,680
and put them into processes

607
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,840
and execute on them.

608
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,800
And I help build those frameworks

609
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,520
with my entrepreneurs as well.

610
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,040
I think it's part of the great value

611
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,240
that I bring as an investor

612
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,760
Authentic, it's who I am.

613
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,960
It's my core. It's part of me.

614
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,080
And resilience.

615
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,440
Resilience is important part of my job

616
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,360
as I feel as a young woman in tech,

617
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,240
and in an investment world.

618
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,120
It takes a lot of resilience

619
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,680
and a lot of grit,

620
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,200
which I share with the entrepreneurs

621
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,440
I invest in as well.

622
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,960
And it's a big part of how I see

623
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,880
my core values and that I impart.

624
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,920
I love it.

625
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,360
And one thing you would say

626
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,280
to a young entrepreneur

627
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,640
just starting their journey.

628
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,400
Now during the pandemic,

629
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,200
they decide to go and start a startup.

630
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,920
What would you tell them?

631
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,200
Keep at it.

632
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,040
And keep working really hard.

633
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,720
Listen to your customers'

634
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,000
gain market feedback.

635
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,320
And you know better than all the investors

636
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,360
that don't take "No" as a reason

637
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,280
not to fulfill your dream.

638
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:23,910
I love it.

639
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,080
Tal, thank you very much.

640
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,080
Toda raba.

641
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,360
Toda raba.

642
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,000
This was fantastic. Thank you.

643
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,520
Appreciate it. Thank you.

644
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,500
Take care.

645
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,650
Bye bye.
