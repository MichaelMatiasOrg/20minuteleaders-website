1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,640
I can tell you that for me,

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,306
I try to really balance both

3
00:00:03,506 --> 00:00:05,429
because I'm kind of a nerd.

4
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:09,090
So it's important for me to put the effort.

5
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,360
Maya Avni, thank you so much

6
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,040
for being on my show.

7
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,760
How are you?

8
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,960
I'm good, Michael.

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,160
So great being here.

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,560
Well, obviously, you're good because

11
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,240
you're at the GSB right behind you now.

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,520
You're not actually

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,832
outside in front of the GSB,

14
00:00:53,032 --> 00:00:56,000
but you are in very close proximity, right?

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,920
Yeah, that's true.

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,113
I'm on campus right now.

17
00:00:58,313 --> 00:00:59,284
Actually, I live here,

18
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:00,520
so it's really, really nice.

19
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,880
It is, though, sunny,

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,960
as you can see in the picture.

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,817
So, I like it.

22
00:01:05,017 --> 00:01:06,440
It is. It's beautiful.

23
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,320
Actually, I think this episode is likely,

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,800
I think it airs in about December.

25
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,560
So, I'll be getting ready

26
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,520
to come back to campus.

27
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,516
But you've had the privilege

28
00:01:13,716 --> 00:01:14,692
of being on campus

29
00:01:14,892 --> 00:01:16,600
throughout a lot of this covid situation.

30
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,373
So, I'd love to both talk about your journey

31
00:01:19,573 --> 00:01:23,080
going from 8200 to different startups,

32
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,480
as QA to Google, and now most recently,

33
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,160
Stanford Graduate School of Business.

34
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,509
But I'm particularly interested to hear about

35
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:32,879
how you've dealt with covid

36
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,868
as part of this

37
00:01:34,068 --> 00:01:36,051
incredible business school program

38
00:01:36,251 --> 00:01:38,332
and what the GSB is all about anyways.

39
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:39,356
Maya, take me back.

40
00:01:39,556 --> 00:01:41,080
First of all, who is Maya all the way back

41
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,360
to the 8200 days?

42
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,245
And how do you go about this path

43
00:01:44,246 --> 00:01:46,200
to end up at the GSB?

44
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,640
Wow.

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,400
Okay, so that's a lot.

46
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,480
So, let's start

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,720
and if you want to stop me,

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,480
just feel free obviously.

49
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,755
So, I think, actually, maybe I can start even

50
00:01:55,955 --> 00:01:57,299
from my high school.

51
00:01:57,499 --> 00:01:59,883
At high school I was a dancer actually,

52
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,720
which is pretty far away from everything

53
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,800
that I'm doing today.

54
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,600
I loved it very much.

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,870
And then when it was time

56
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,565
to get to go to the army,

57
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:10,000
like everyone in Israel,

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,400
when you get to the age of 18,

59
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
you have to go to the army

60
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,240
I really wanted to do

61
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,400
something super meaningful.

62
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,480
So, I decided to drop

63
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,520
my dancing kind of path

64
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,526
and I went to 8200.

65
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,880
8200 for me was the first time

66
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,720
that I fell in love with technology.

67
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,400
This is how I see it.

68
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,901
First time that you are exposed

69
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:33,120
in very young age to really some crazy things

70
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,240
that we can do thanks to technology.

71
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,754
I spend there three years

72
00:02:37,954 --> 00:02:38,913
and I really knew that

73
00:02:39,113 --> 00:02:40,463
whatever I'm going to do next

74
00:02:40,663 --> 00:02:42,000
is going to be around technology.

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,360
I didn't know what it was going to be,

76
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,200
but I knew technology will definitely be

77
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,080
part of my life going forward.

78
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,400
Amazing.

79
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,080
Yeah, and then after that I did like,

80
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,120
like every Israeli I went to Central America.

81
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,142
Did a few months there,

82
00:03:00,342 --> 00:03:01,166
like clean my head,

83
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:02,640
thought about what I wanted to do.

84
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,456
When I came back,

85
00:03:03,656 --> 00:03:05,594
I decided to start engineering

86
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:07,080
in Tel Aviv University.

87
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,441
And while I was doing

88
00:03:08,442 --> 00:03:09,400
my engineering degree,

89
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:11,640
I started working at Google.

90
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,200
And that was like

91
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,880
a very meaningful stop in my way.

92
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,440
I spent there six years.

93
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,280
I absolutely love the company.

94
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,184
And after six years, I felt like

95
00:03:22,384 --> 00:03:23,975
there are a lot of things out there

96
00:03:24,175 --> 00:03:26,397
that I don't know and I'm not really sure

97
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,800
how I'm going to explore those things.

98
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,920
And then I started to think

99
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,040
about doing an MBA.

100
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,200
By the way, I do want to mention here,

101
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,400
because this is a little bit divergent

102
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,755
from what a lot of people

103
00:03:38,955 --> 00:03:39,720
around the world experience.

104
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,560
Because usually when you go to college

105
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,040
and you study whatever it may be,

106
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,945
you don't go and work full time at a company,

107
00:03:44,946 --> 00:03:46,800
especially on a company like Google

108
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,480
while you're studying in.

109
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,680
And it's well, it's a little bit different.

110
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,120
You go to the army,

111
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,880
you spend quite a few years in the army,

112
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,400
whether it's two, all the way

113
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,880
to some people, six.

114
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,080
And then by the time that you go to college,

115
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,480
you're mature enough to both

116
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,680
handle a full degree,

117
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,968
which is extremely intensive

118
00:04:01,168 --> 00:04:02,868
through your program in Israel,

119
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:04,703
along with a full time job

120
00:04:04,903 --> 00:04:05,960
for only four years

121
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,920
if you're doing the engineering

122
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,480
and juggling Google.

123
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,720
So, I think that's amazing.

124
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,280
Yeah.

125
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,680
So, I started working at Google

126
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,200
at my second year of the university.

127
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,080
So, it was really challenging.

128
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,475
But I can say that

129
00:04:19,675 --> 00:04:21,753
Google is such an amazing place

130
00:04:21,953 --> 00:04:22,960
in the sense that,

131
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,240
like, my first conversation

132
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,257
with my manager was:

133
00:04:27,457 --> 00:04:29,247
okay, we want to keep you like

134
00:04:29,447 --> 00:04:30,560
the top of your class.

135
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,200
So it's very, very important for us

136
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,344
that you keep putting the effort

137
00:04:35,544 --> 00:04:37,603
that you need in university

138
00:04:37,803 --> 00:04:39,280
and whatever you need.

139
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,680
So, that was really amazing

140
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,720
to kind of combine the both.

141
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,400
Sure.

142
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,040
So, talk to me about this

143
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,897
how do you think about going through an MBA?

144
00:04:48,097 --> 00:04:49,983
Because you're spending six years at Google,

145
00:04:50,183 --> 00:04:52,320
you're doing really amazing work there.

146
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,920
I saw you quite a few times

147
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,560
at Google for Startups Building

148
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,120
just in the months leading up to Stanford.

149
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,640
But what makes you want to go do an MBA,

150
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,120
stop your career wherever it may be,

151
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,440
and go become a student again?

152
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,080
Yeah, I mean, I think the first question

153
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,800
that a lot of people ask themselves is

154
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,520
whether or not MBA really worth it.

155
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,034
You know, it's exactly how you said.

156
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,412
You take two years break

157
00:05:15,612 --> 00:05:17,200
from everything you're doing in your life,

158
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,120
like the opportunity cost here is so big.

159
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,800
You're losing two years of salary.

160
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,060
You're losing two years of maybe promotions

161
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,960
and what you're going to do next.

162
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,440
And a lot of people feel like

163
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,160
maybe it's not the best choice.

164
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,440
Like it really depends on who you ask.

165
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,780
And I totally get that to be honest.

166
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,600
You need to sacrifice a lot.

167
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,760
But then again, you have to ask yourself

168
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,260
why you want to do it

169
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,400
and why you actually are doing that.

170
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,400
And I think that for me, the answer was,

171
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,760
first of all, as I started to say,

172
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,426
I wanted to explore more options.

173
00:05:49,626 --> 00:05:52,160
Here at Stanford, I think about everything

174
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,000
that I did last year.

175
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,360
I'm now on my second year.

176
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,360
So I think about everything

177
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,520
that I did last year.

178
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,130
Where in my life would I have

179
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,720
so many opportunities just kind of squeezed

180
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,160
into this one year that I think about

181
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,840
all the things that I did last year.

182
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,640
Experience in a VC,

183
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,480
in different tech companies, in products,

184
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,680
and things that I never did before.

185
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,720
So, for me, first of all,

186
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,840
it was like a safe space to explore

187
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,320
other things that I've never done.

188
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,640
So, that was first.

189
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,536
The second thing that I think

190
00:06:26,736 --> 00:06:28,506
is even more important

191
00:06:28,706 --> 00:06:30,920
is thinking for the long term.

192
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,960
And this is like the main reason why I'm here,

193
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,720
because thinking for the long term,

194
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,920
I think about who am I, as like,

195
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
first of all, employee.

196
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,680
But after that is also

197
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,560
maybe a leader, a manager.

198
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,360
What do I bring to the table.

199
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,720
And I think that in terms of my skill set,

200
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,810
I really wanted to make sure that

201
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,440
I have like a very diverse skill set.

202
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,805
And I wanted to make sure that

203
00:06:57,005 --> 00:06:59,400
when I want to be like a manager,

204
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,560
maybe a founder going forward,

205
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,120
I bring to the table valuable stuff.

206
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,570
Both in terms of skill set,

207
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,286
but also who am I as a person,

208
00:07:09,486 --> 00:07:10,880
what my values are.

209
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:13,680
And Stanford is a lot about the values

210
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,200
and who you are as a leader.

211
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,080
What kind of things are important for you,

212
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,080
what kind of thing you want to push forward.

213
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,847
And I think that the last thing

214
00:07:22,047 --> 00:07:23,294
that kind of brought me here

215
00:07:23,295 --> 00:07:25,480
was the community.

216
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,440
In a second,

217
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,400
you are part of this amazing community

218
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,760
of like the best people

219
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,240
here in Silicon Valley.

220
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,639
The Israelis are like a very nice group

221
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,080
that we all know each other.

222
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,880
So, Maya, I have to ask you,

223
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,120
I have a few short questions and answers.

224
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,797
Because I think that it's really,

225
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:47,367
it's incredibly important

226
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,935
to understand the context

227
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,760
of what a business school environment is like.

228
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,320
I did not go to business school myself,

229
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,200
not yet at least.

230
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,160
But I did get to experience from the side

231
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,554
and just hanging out with you around campus,

232
00:07:57,754 --> 00:07:59,240
because especially at Stanford,

233
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,520
it's like all intertwined.

234
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,920
We sometimes go to the same classes.

235
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,954
I believe that you took a class recently

236
00:08:05,154 --> 00:08:06,280
with my girlfriend, right?

237
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,240
And she's in graduate school.

238
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,040
So, quickly, who is the type of person

239
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,800
that you would find at the GSB?

240
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,840
Give me some high level characteristics.

241
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,680
What are they like?

242
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,440
You'll find all types of people,

243
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,444
really, but the best ones.

244
00:08:22,445 --> 00:08:24,850
And what that does mean?

245
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:26,200
Is that the most hard working,

246
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,920
the most humble, the nicest?

247
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,360
What does it mean, the best people?

248
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,320
I think, yeah, the most humble.

249
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,800
I don't know if the most humble,

250
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,940
but definitely people around here

251
00:08:35,941 --> 00:08:39,760
are very humble.

252
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,360
All of the things that you say are like

253
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,172
everyone is coming

254
00:08:42,372 --> 00:08:44,043
from a very different background.

255
00:08:44,243 --> 00:08:46,120
Having like a different background,

256
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,520
I mean, both industries,

257
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,720
but also from everywhere in the world.

258
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,560
So, yeah, a lot of hardworking people

259
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,760
doing their best, you know,

260
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,400
to excel and be the best

261
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,880
in everything that they're doing.

262
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,880
But also there is a huge emphasis

263
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,640
of what kind of person you are

264
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,880
and like being good people,

265
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,120
being good friend.

266
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,960
What kind of values are important for you.

267
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,711
These are things

268
00:09:09,911 --> 00:09:12,160
that we talk a lot about here.

269
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,520
And actually, you know

270
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,320
one of my impressions by meeting

271
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,765
a lot of the people in your cohort

272
00:09:17,965 --> 00:09:18,966
is that every single person

273
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,280
is a leader in their community.

274
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,800
And when you say the best people,

275
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,229
what I'm thinking to mind

276
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,360
is whatever your circumstances were,

277
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,480
you made the most out of it and beyond,

278
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,160
and you've excelled in your circumstances.

279
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,280
You've helped improve the lives of others.

280
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,640
Talk to me.

281
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,520
So, you mentioned being good people

282
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,120
and being in touch with yourself.

283
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,920
Touchy feely.

284
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,024
I heard about that class

285
00:09:37,224 --> 00:09:38,280
from so many different people.

286
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,722
Why is this a good representation

287
00:09:40,922 --> 00:09:43,492
of what the GSB encompasses?

288
00:09:43,692 --> 00:09:44,960
So, touchy feely,

289
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,835
the official name of the class

290
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,640
is interpersonal dynamics.

291
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,040
I'm just taking the class right now,

292
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,640
this quarter.

293
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,400
And yeah, it is a very special class.

294
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,320
You spend a lot of hours per week

295
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,080
with a very small group of people,

296
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,680
and basically it's kind of a safe place

297
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,160
to work on your communication skills,

298
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,160
and how do people feel about

299
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,280
specific actions that you're doing.

300
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,560
And it helps you understand

301
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,160
what kind of message you deliver

302
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,323
to the other side

303
00:10:18,523 --> 00:10:20,981
and maybe how can you improve

304
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:22,760
and be more efficient

305
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,736
in the things that you wanted to say

306
00:10:24,936 --> 00:10:26,464
and how you're saying that.

307
00:10:26,664 --> 00:10:28,233
It's actually really interesting

308
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:29,360
because all the alums,

309
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,892
these early alums at least

310
00:10:31,092 --> 00:10:32,480
that I met like a year ago,

311
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,160
even some that graduated like 20 years ago,

312
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,920
all of them are saying that this was like

313
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,800
the most meaningful experience for them

314
00:10:39,801 --> 00:10:40,880
from the GSB.

315
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,160
So, yeah, so I'm doing it right now.

316
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,280
So, maybe we can speak like in a few weeks

317
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,280
to see whether or not

318
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,240
it's the case for me.

319
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,589
I guess it will be.

320
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:50,080
So in a higher level,

321
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,756
you're thinking about graduate school

322
00:10:51,956 --> 00:10:53,341
of Business at Stanford and all of sudden

323
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,273
you have a class which is all about working

324
00:10:55,473 --> 00:10:56,240
on your personal skills.

325
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,120
And, you know, people call it touchy feely.

326
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,440
And it sounds to me like, you know,

327
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,918
my perception of the business school

328
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,080
up until now was you're coming,

329
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,240
you're learning how to do accounting,

330
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,603
you're learning how to hire people,

331
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,480
how to fire people and how to raise money.

332
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,130
But it sounds like

333
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,960
it's a little bit more complicated than that.

334
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,840
What do you get out

335
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,840
of a business school program?

336
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,856
And this is especially, I think important

337
00:11:16,056 --> 00:11:17,983
because it's sort of like a black box

338
00:11:18,183 --> 00:11:20,320
to a lot of us in the undergraduate world.

339
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,697
We don't really understand

340
00:11:21,897 --> 00:11:23,931
why would people go to do an MBA

341
00:11:24,131 --> 00:11:25,523
when now there's a lot of movements

342
00:11:25,723 --> 00:11:26,500
that are saying maybe

343
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,995
you can just go into the business world

344
00:11:27,996 --> 00:11:30,280
and get those skills yourself?

345
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,800
Yeah, that's a great question.

346
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,440
And so I think, first of all,

347
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,364
the beautiful thing about Stanford

348
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:40,314
is from your second quarter here,

349
00:11:40,514 --> 00:11:41,937
you can choose electives

350
00:11:42,137 --> 00:11:43,937
and you can build your own schedule

351
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,480
and kind of focus in on things

352
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,160
that you are interested the most.

353
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,750
So depending on what your goal are,

354
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,442
like people are coming here

355
00:11:51,642 --> 00:11:53,960
wanting to be better in finance and investing.

356
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,234
People are coming here

357
00:11:55,434 --> 00:11:57,024
wanting to build their own startup

358
00:11:57,224 --> 00:11:58,274
and learn more about

359
00:11:58,474 --> 00:11:59,533
entrepreneurship and VC.

360
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:01,400
So it really depends on what you want,

361
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,280
but you can get everything honestly.

362
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,265
So, it's like one of probably,

363
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:09,369
one of my advices would be

364
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:11,600
to come here a little bit focused

365
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,520
on what do you want to achieve here.

366
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,292
Because otherwise you can really get lost

367
00:12:16,492 --> 00:12:18,927
in all the things that you can do here.

368
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:20,800
But you can really get it all.

369
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,184
So, there are a lot of people here

370
00:12:22,384 --> 00:12:23,640
that are working on their startups,

371
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,800
taking a lot of entrepreneurship classes,

372
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,400
meeting a lot of different VCs.

373
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,109
You know, the guests

374
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:30,319
that are coming to our classes?

375
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
Now it's on Zoom.

376
00:12:31,321 --> 00:12:34,480
So, well, you know less.

377
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,480
But the people that are coming to our classes

378
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,089
are amazing.

379
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:40,862
Like the people from the best VCs,

380
00:12:41,062 --> 00:12:43,360
entrepreneurs that did like sold one,

381
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,704
two, three, four companies

382
00:12:44,904 --> 00:12:45,985
in millions of dollars

383
00:12:45,986 --> 00:12:48,840
can tell us all about their path.

384
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,640
Other people that are coming from PE,

385
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,680
private equity,

386
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,109
and other investment background

387
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:59,240
can get a lot of background about finance,

388
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,160
accounting, all the things that you did.

389
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,196
And everyone are putting a lot of effort also

390
00:13:04,396 --> 00:13:05,680
into more soft skills.

391
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,080
So presentation skills, communication skills,

392
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,139
role playing about having

393
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,480
difficult conversations and stuff like that,

394
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,760
which is like I really like this.

395
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,400
So, it really depends

396
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
on what you're interested in.

397
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,120
But you have here everything honestly.

398
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,040
One focus. One more question about the GSB

399
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,770
and then, I'd love to also focus a little bit

400
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:28,474
about who you are and some of the things

401
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:29,960
that you're really passionate about.

402
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,320
But first, how much do you actually work

403
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:32,973
in the GSB?

404
00:13:33,173 --> 00:13:34,861
Like how much of it is actually

405
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:36,440
doing homework, sitting down,

406
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,910
solving problem sets,

407
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,400
like I'm doing about 23 hours a day

408
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,364
in the undergraduate world,

409
00:13:42,564 --> 00:13:44,600
versus the networking in the community?

410
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,720
Yeah.

411
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,715
So, once again,

412
00:13:46,915 --> 00:13:48,484
it's a question of who you are

413
00:13:48,684 --> 00:13:50,000
and what's important for you.

414
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,760
People who came here and want to put

415
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:54,440
like 100% in the academics part,

416
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,815
can spend 20, 40 hours a week

417
00:13:58,015 --> 00:14:01,320
just doing homework and working for classes.

418
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,320
Other people, I think most of the people

419
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,680
who came here came over for the network.

420
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,058
So,  it's really important

421
00:14:07,258 --> 00:14:09,455
to get to know people have coffee chats,

422
00:14:09,655 --> 00:14:12,560
like we have once in a while.

423
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,000
And I can tell you that for me,

424
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,600
I try to really balance both

425
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,240
because I'm kind of a nerd.

426
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:22,328
So,  it's important for me to put the effort

427
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,240
and make sure

428
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,440
that the classes that I'm taking,

429
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,568
I'm taking very seriously

430
00:14:25,768 --> 00:14:27,320
because I want to take the most out of it.

431
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,351
But also meeting new people,

432
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:31,884
having coffee chat,

433
00:14:32,084 --> 00:14:35,014
and like having some fun with new friends

434
00:14:35,214 --> 00:14:36,800
and expanding my network,

435
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,280
it's super important for me.

436
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,316
This is maybe the main reason

437
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:41,440
why I came here.

438
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,280
So, I put a lot of effort there as well.

439
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,040
So, Maya, a very meaningful service

440
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,480
in the intelligence unit in the IDF.

441
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,520
Years of experience in the field,

442
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,560
an engineering degree,

443
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,195
six years at Google,

444
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,680
now very soon an MBA from Stanford.

445
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,651
Where are you headed

446
00:14:58,851 --> 00:15:00,320
and what are you really passionate about?

447
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,408
What do you really see yourself

448
00:15:02,608 --> 00:15:04,190
digging into it and making an impact

449
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,840
in what field?

450
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,320
That's such a tough question.

451
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,280
To be honest,

452
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,800
I'm not sure what's the answer

453
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,680
for this question yet.

454
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,064
I can tell you that I did my last six months,

455
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:18,848
I worked as a product manager at Brex.

456
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:20,480
Brex is a super cool company,

457
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
FinTech company now valued

458
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,640
at three billion dollars.

459
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,280
[--] I believe, right?

460
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,758
Yeah, true. Undergrads, though.

461
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,360
They didn't graduate. But yeah.

462
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,680
And I really enjoyed my time there.

463
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,000
I really liked the product.

464
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,600
It's the first time that I'm doing that.

465
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,096
So, building something

466
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:44,190
and thinking about the problem,

467
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,840
what the users really want,

468
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,120
thinking about the solution,

469
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,960
how to design it,

470
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,480
then going through the marketing stage,

471
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,560
and how do we launch the product.

472
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,280
I really, really enjoyed that.

473
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,887
So, the way that I see it,

474
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:59,960
I would love to do something around product.

475
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,240
And I also really enjoyed FinTech.

476
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,200
So, this is an area

477
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,440
that I am passionate about.

478
00:16:05,441 --> 00:16:06,813
I think so many things

479
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,960
are happening right now in this space.

480
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,200
Innovation is just waiting to happen.

481
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,920
This is how I feel.

482
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,440
So, this is something that I'm very,

483
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,040
very passionate about.

484
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,720
But we'll see.

485
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,080
I don't know.

486
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,760
I want to, at least for now,

487
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,480
just to keep the opportunities open

488
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,880
and we'll wait and see.

489
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,688
Right. Is there a specific experience

490
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,083
that you've accumulated so far

491
00:16:30,283 --> 00:16:31,591
that you can really pinpoint them and say:

492
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,979
this is something that

493
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:34,600
that I learned a tremendous amount,

494
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,560
something that may not be too obvious?

495
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,160
Specifically from Brex?

496
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,240
Either Brex or any of the other job.

497
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,846
Because one of the things

498
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,000
that I'm especially curious about,

499
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
especially through this show,

500
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,848
is the non-linear career pathways

501
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:47,720
that people take.

502
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,760
And like you, like many others,

503
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,040
it's a non-linear career.

504
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,240
It's you're moving from the IDF to studies

505
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,160
to a corporate to a business school,

506
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,840
and you're getting all these

507
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,240
incredible experiences that I'm sure

508
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,739
that when we'll do this chat again

509
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,396
in 10 years

510
00:17:01,596 --> 00:17:03,075
after you've impacted millions of lives

511
00:17:03,076 --> 00:17:04,680
with whatever you'll do,

512
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,120
it's always interesting for me to gather

513
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,800
this insight from along the journey.

514
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,633
So, what are some

515
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,140
pivotal moments in your life

516
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,423
that you really are going back to

517
00:17:13,623 --> 00:17:14,560
and thinking, wow,

518
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,280
I'm so glad that I had that experience,

519
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,000
even though maybe I didn't realize

520
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,320
the value of it at that moment?

521
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,293
I'll give you an answer

522
00:17:21,493 --> 00:17:22,795
that I'm not sure you're going to like,

523
00:17:22,796 --> 00:17:24,440
but I'll try.

524
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:26,993
I think that one of the most important things

525
00:17:26,994 --> 00:17:29,040
that I learned that change

526
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,360
is always positive, always.

527
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,215
Doing a change,

528
00:17:33,415 --> 00:17:35,198
going outside your comfort zone,

529
00:17:35,398 --> 00:17:36,480
you always learn a lot.

530
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,384
And the things that

531
00:17:37,584 --> 00:17:40,488
are most important to learn about

532
00:17:40,688 --> 00:17:42,387
are the things to understand

533
00:17:42,587 --> 00:17:44,264
what you really want to do,

534
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:45,880
what really interests you.

535
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,240
Not everybody knows it.

536
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,760
Like what is the perfect job for you?

537
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,320
Why you want to be an entrepreneur?

538
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,720
Is it really the thing for you?

539
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,880
Why you want to go to product?

540
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,373
Like try to understand exactly

541
00:17:57,573 --> 00:17:59,408
what you're looking for,

542
00:17:59,608 --> 00:18:01,443
like what is your perfect role,

543
00:18:01,643 --> 00:18:03,160
what is your perfect company,

544
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,880
and try to understand the why.

545
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,800
I think these are kind of the questions

546
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,400
that I've been asking myself a lot lately.

547
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,704
And these are the type of questions,

548
00:18:12,904 --> 00:18:14,645
type of answer is more accurately

549
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:17,462
that will help me shape my next step

550
00:18:17,662 --> 00:18:19,935
and understand what kind of job I want to do

551
00:18:20,135 --> 00:18:21,831
that will make me feel happy,

552
00:18:22,031 --> 00:18:25,400
make me feel like I have a huge impact.

553
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:28,840
So, in every time that I did a change,

554
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,696
that helped me to take another step forward

555
00:18:31,896 --> 00:18:35,600
to understand the answers to those questions.

556
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,300
Amazing.

557
00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:37,463
Maya, I want to thank you again

558
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:38,800
for being so generous with your time.

559
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,680
I did like that answer very, very much.

560
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,103
And I want to thank you also

561
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,352
for being such a pivotal

562
00:18:43,552 --> 00:18:45,240
and important part of my journey at Stanford.

563
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,040
So, we are countless coffee chats

564
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,160
and your help with everything.

565
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,487
It's warming to have such

566
00:18:51,687 --> 00:18:54,480
a strong Israeli society within Stanford.

567
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,680
Like half of my professors

568
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,240
somehow every quarter are Israeli,

569
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,560
which is just phenomenal.

570
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,975
But having classmates and people

571
00:19:00,175 --> 00:19:01,960
that I can look up to, like yourself

572
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,920
that are helping along the journey.

573
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,000
So, thank you for that.

574
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Before we go, I have the last question,

575
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,001
the most important one,

576
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:08,995
three words that you would use

577
00:19:08,996 --> 00:19:11,080
to describe yourself.

578
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,960
That's a tough one.

579
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,880
Okay. For me will be friend,

580
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,960
curious, and problem-solver.

581
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,080
You'll give me the last one

582
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,440
as as if it was a one word.

583
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,560
There is a hyphen in there.

584
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,280
Exactly.

585
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,880
Friend, curious, and problem solver.

586
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,560
Maya, thank you very much. Toda raba.

587
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,100
Best of luck with finishing this year

588
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:33,040
at the GSB.

589
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,920
I definitely hope to see you either

590
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,320
in January or in March

591
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,440
when I'm finally back on campus.

592
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,280
And I can be in that wonderful weather.

593
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,269
Not that it's not that bad in Tel Aviv,

594
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,760
I have to say about the weather,

595
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,320
but I think there is less protests

596
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,040
on the streets of Stanford right now.

597
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,160
But I'm looking forward

598
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,360
to seeing you again soon.

599
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,200
Thank you, Michael.

600
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,040
Looking forward.

601
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:54,800
Bye. Take care.
