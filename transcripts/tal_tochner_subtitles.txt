Tal Tochner, thank you for joining me in 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? I'm great. I'm really excited to be here. Thank you so much for having me. Well, I'm really excited that you are here. So, where are you calling from right now? I'm calling from our office in Tel Aviv. Okay. The PICO offices. The PICO offices, that's right. Wonderful. Wonderful. Okay. Well, I'm glad to see that things are still happening there, even though the situation is so dire. But hopefully, by the time this airs, it'll die down a bit and things will get a little bit better. First, I want to talk about morning dance parties. What is that all about? Oh, my goodness. So, I have an incredible morning routine that includes writing and gratitude, and meditations, and a bit of yoga. But my favorite part is relax in the music that wakes up all my neighbors super early and just dancing that off the wall. I love it. I love it. Okay. I've been trying to get into morning routine myself, but I, and everybody's been telling me about the meditation and gratitude part. I think that I'm going to start by adopting this morning dance party. And then move on to those because that seems like a really nice part of it. Tal, I'm going to let you talk a little bit about your journey. Because I'm not going to be able to do justice. But just a small recap. Currently, an investor within PICO, you are also a Forbes 30 under 30, founded several organizations, WMN, part of them. But you also did a lot of other work in terms of female empowerment and leadership globally, not just in tech. And I'd love to actually get started with that in just a second. And then weave the conversation into how you invest within PICO, and what do you bring to the table for the both portfolio companies, but also a part of your investment thesis. So, Tal, take us away. Talk to me a little bit about your journey. Where you're from, and how you got to where you are? Amazing. So, I was born and raised in the US. In Newark, New Jersey. I moved to Israel when I was about 16. And I've been here ever since. Did spent some time in the army. Went to Hebrew University. And was, to be honest with you, I've wanted always to be a diplomat. And from that dream, somehow, I became a venture capitalist. A little bit different. A little different, but much of the same. What is the same between being a diplomat and being a venture capitalist? I'm really passionate about Israel and telling Israel's phenomenal story. So, as a venture capitalist, I get the opportunity to tell the economic phenomenal story and not the side of a political one. And I feel like that brings a lot of great things together. Okay. And so, growing up to become a diplomat, what does that entail? Is that like model United Nations and that sort of stuff? How do you set yourself up to become a diplomat and then make that rapid transition into venture capital? So, I took to learn lot of international and global learning experiences and conferences. Whether it was the model UN, whether it was international diplomacy, peace building, humanitarian aid. I was traveling around the world and taking part in unique learning experiences in order to acquire the soft skills that will help me succeed. And the learning experiences that will helped me become better professionally. And when I started university, I set out to study Chinese and international relations because I thought that would position me in a very unique way to go into foreign service. Because not many people speak Chinese, definitely not about [--]. And it's more relevant than ever. More relevant than ever. And that actually took me to the business side, and not the diplomatic side, which is surprising. And I'm extremely grateful and happy about that. So, what was your first dip into the business side of things out of the diplomacy side? So, towards the end of my first year of university, I decided to intern for an incredible CEO, Rebecca Zeffert at the Israel Asia Center. Which is an incredible organization that basically fosters collaborations between Israel and all countries around Asia. Specifically around economic ties. And that basically was my entry point to the entire startup ecosystem here in Israel. I was hosting high level senior delegations of investors and entrepreneurs and government officials and connecting them to the localized system here. Were you able to use any of the Chinese you learned in university, or was that not even a part of it? My Chinese is not as good as I hoped it would be. Very very nice. Okay. Now talk to me a little bit about this thing that you founded, which you're empowering female leaders, not necessarily in tech, but in all sectors. And you're doing it in a pretty cool way. So, tell me a little bit about what that program was about and then we'll transition to some of the investments. About five years ago, I co-founded an organization called the Women's Parliament, that really fosters female leadership across the board, all over Israel. And for me personally, it was extremely important to invest in mid to senior leadership. But also showcase the various, Israel's extremely unique, right? We have a lot of different sectors and societies. And I wanted to make sure that we have everyone there as a whole. So, we have women that from the public sector, from the private sector, from non-profits, from all across Israel, from south to north. We have Haredi women, we have Arab women, we have Olean, new immigrants. And this program really sets out to help them acquire skill sets that they're going to need in order to become the future leaders of Israel. Now, what does that actually mean tangibly? So then, you join this program, you identify these women, what do you actually do with them to make that leap? So, we have meetings every so often with either thought leaders or entrepreneurs or government leaders that tell their personal stories, but also give them help. Also provide a practical skill that these females can use within their own organizations. And through that, we also foster relationships and mentorship, and friendships amongst the women that to really help them increase their network in order to succeed. So, when I looked at my own network, I said, "Okay. I'm very much in high tech, in a startup ecosystem." I don't know anything else around me. Definitely not at the time, right? And if I want to succeed in a really meaningful way, I need to establish a much broader network. And that's how this came to be. And that's what was so important for us. To bring in women that really depict all of Israel's society from all different sectors. And there have been a lot of really great outcomes and friendships and collaborations that have come out of this incredible form. And so, are there any common threads that you've noticed among the members in this program where there are specific things that collectively they need or collectively are looking for as they join this program and are making the leap? Yes. I think women as a whole have a lot of challenges as they step up from mid-level, to senior level to executives. And there's a lot that always happens around negotiation skills a lot about internal politics, a lot about management, right? When you move from mid-level to senior level, and how do you manage a team, and how do you manage the time effectively. A lot about productivity, a lot about facilitation of relationships and strategic partnerships. Those are things that are common threads that across the industries you deal with on a day to day level. And was it helpful that this is a community that is strictly for women in terms of their empowerment? Because all of these skills are hugely relevant to both genders, right? But I'm trying to assess whether the fact that it's a community that it's by women for women, gives them a little bit more flexibility and more confidence to go and utilize them. 100%. I think that it provides a really strong foundation where you're not afraid to raise your hands and ask the question. Where you don't feel like you're constantly being judged. Where you can really come and be yourself, and be your authentic self. And really create those meaningful relationships that will really help you take yourself to the next level. Wonderful. Okay, Tal, so you forwent your passion for diplomacy to go into investing. Today you're at PICO. You've had a couple of other gigs with investing before. Talk to me a little bit about investing. What is investing for you? And what do you do specifically at PICO that you're so excited about? So, at PICO Partners, I have an incredible opportunity to really work with founders. We're really early stage fund. So, where normally the first institutional money in the company. So, sometimes we invest really at the idea phase. So, I get to work with entrepreneurs from in idea and presentation and help them build companies. And that's something that's so exciting for me. Everything from the ideation, to the productization to the go to market strategy, to hiring and business development and setting up shop in a global country. It's an incredible, it's something that gets me really excited to wake up every day to do. So, walk me through your day to day. You arrive in the morning, or you're in the beginning of the week at PICO Partners, and what is the day in the life of Tal Tochner look like? Every day is different. There is no common thread. I spend a lot of time meeting with entrepreneurs and learning about new industries and understanding whether, hearing a lot of pitches and trying to think whether these are valuable businesses and scalable businesses that fit our investment thesis. And a big part of my work also goes to actually working with the entrepreneurs that I invested in on their daily challenges. Making sure that, we're going through really rough times all around the world, corona, covid-19 has really impacted a lot of businesses and a lot of markets globally. And I want to be my entrepreneur's biggest cheerleader. And I want to make sure that they have what it takes. And I can be helpful for them to make it through successfully. And sometimes that entails working with them on hiring and refining their value proposition or their go to market strategy, doing some market research. And I do a lot of work with the entrepreneurs in all of those things. So, how does that actually the process start? Because the way that I'm looking at this, especially in the very very early stage, so, let's say the ideation phase, the entrepreneur has become really experts in this domain. They become truly passionate about this. What is your role as the institutional fund that comes in and supports them into helping them encapsulate this ideation into a product, hire, follow on to their future investments? How do you actually go and follow these entrepreneurs? Is it, do you have a set things that you expect them to do, or you expect yourself to do? Or is it more dynamic for entrepreneur? It's very dynamic for entrepreneur. I think different entrepreneurs value many different things. But ultimately, I will never know better sector, or a specific technology better than the entrepreneur that's there and working day to day. But I do have an incredible benchmark, having seen a lot of different companies, a lot of different scenarios. Researching a lot of different markets that I can come from with an outside view and be, Hey, what do you think about that? Hey, this worked well with this company. Why don't you think of utilizing this for you in this case as well? And that's I think, where venture capitalists can be real value added and helpful to the entrepreneurs. Okay. And is there a specific market that you're particularly excited about? Or, is that very agnostic? Oh, wow. So, I'm very generalist and I'm very agnostic. But I'm extremely passionate about the future of work. Digital health space is something I'm looking a lot into right now. Deep tech I'm really excited about. Those are things that I'm really deep diving on. But I look at a lot of different sectors. So, give me a couple of insights into this idea of digital health, the future of the workplace. Because obviously that's something that's hugely relevant to myself, to anybody that's listening on the show, to any entrepreneur that is starting out their journey. What are some of the trends that you've been seeing over the past few months? And if I ask you, Tal, what do you think are the key cornerstones, or key milestones as we move along in this new reality? When I look at the future of work, the way we're working is likely to fundamentally change. We're now getting used to working remotely. What does that mean? How do you manage teams effectively? How do you secure the network? Think about all these heavy enterprises that are on print, how do you move employees effectively work from home. Connectivity. We spoke about communication between teams, building culture, all of that. There's so much opportunity and things that are going to have to change in our day to day. Right. No no. Go ahead. When I think about digital health, is global pandemic really pause a lot of opportunities for companies to really disrupt remote care. We see telemedicine right now booming. How do you, and I think right now consumers are used to getting a lot of their services remotely. And I think that's something that's going to be very hard to go back to the old days. So, I think right now, when I look at hospitals and I look at clinics, and I look at private practices and I look at the payers and they're going to have to do a lot of work to transition. And in order to stay relevant and keep up with the trend and what consumers are expecting to have. So, what's important for you when you meet an entrepreneur and you're considering joining them on the journey? What sort of like your thesis into, these are things that I'm excited about and that I trust, these are things that I'm a little bit more worried about? And obviously, this is something that would go a long way for any young entrepreneur watching us. So, as an early stage investor, the thing I look at and spend the most time on is the team. Why did they choose to go after this, this specific industry or problem? Why are they best positioned to solve it? What are they most passionate about? What's the purpose behind what they're doing? And I think you would know, right? Founding a startup and being an entrepreneur, is something that's extremely difficult. The cycles of the success are never linear. There are always loops. And you need to have a lot of resilience and a lot of great endurance in order to succeed. And you need to be very mission driven. And so, that's something that I spend a lot of time on. And again, I personally am excited about things that are going to change the way we live, the way we consume things, the way we operate, that will impact our lives. And also, on the other hand, operational efficiency, innovative business models. Fixing broken business processes in old industries, which is what's exciting for me in digital health, for instance. So, I look on the team and the market opportunity primarily. So, one of the things that I'm always very excited about and we're very interested in is how different institutions come into a startup and now have to play a similar role, different role, depending on the round that they join. How do you, as an investor, come in and see this relationship also with other investors who come into the startup? Whether at your stage, or a different round, and all of a sudden now you have sometimes conflicting ideas, conflicting strategies, obviously beyond the entrepreneur directs the path. But how do you then create this harmony between the different institutional investors within a startup? It's something that sometimes is hard to do, and it's sometimes challenging and often great. We all have a shared interest, which is the success of the company. And we're all there to be the company's greatest cheerleader. And ultimately, we might have different ideas. But I think our job as investors is to ask the right questions and the challenging questions. And to get the entrepreneur to think of it outside the box or even take the opportunity to reflect, like in board meetings. You take an opportunity to reflect three months back and look three months, six months, two years forward and really plan and strategize. And that's where I think we can be most helpful. And I think where we all have a common thread. And when you say, "we", you're meaning yourselves and the other institutional investors, right? Yes. Us and any other investors around the [--]. Very very very cool. Tal, right before we get to my favorite question, what is the one thing that's the most exciting for you in this whole journey? Whether it's  meeting the entrepreneurs or watching different industries in different markets, boom. What is really the most exciting for you about being an investor? Because you did have ambitions to go into other sectors, but obviously you're having so much fun what are you doing now. I feel so grateful to be the enabler and to help entrepreneurs fulfill their dreams. I think it's an incredible opportunity and it's what wakes me up and keeps me excited every day. I love it. I love it. Okay, and three words that you would use to describe yourself. Execution driven. Authentic. And resilient. Okay. Explain a little bit more about these. Why these three words? So, I'm extremely execution driven. I know how to take a lot of ideas and put them into processes and execute on them. And I help build those frameworks with my entrepreneurs as well. I think it's part of the great value that I bring as an investor Authentic, it's who I am. It's my core. It's part of me. And resilience. Resilience is important part of my job as I feel as a young woman in tech, and in an investment world. It takes a lot of resilience and a lot of grit, which I share with the entrepreneurs I invest in as well. And it's a big part of how I see my core values and that I impart. I love it. And one thing you would say to a young entrepreneur just starting their journey. Now during the pandemic, they decide to go and start a startup. What would you tell them? Keep at it. And keep working really hard. Listen to your customers' gain market feedback. And you know better than all the investors that don't take "No" as a reason not to fulfill your dream. I love it. Tal, thank you very much. Toda raba. Toda raba. This was fantastic. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you. Take care. Bye bye.
