1
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,700
All right! Mor Chen,

2
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,700
thank you so much for joining me 
on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,700
Thank you for having me, Michael. 
I’m very happy to be here.

4
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,300
Really great to have you. 
So, you’re calling from Israel,

5
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,700
from Tel-Aviv?

6
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,700
Yeah, true. It’s Shavuot here.

7
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,700
Yeah! Happy holidays!

8
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,700
Yeah. So, going to 
eat a lot tonight.

9
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,700
Wonderful. Wonderful. 
Yeah. I’m very jealous.

10
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,700
My family is having a 
wonderful dinner right now.

11
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,700
And hopefully, 
next year this time,

12
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,300
I can be with them.

13
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,300
But with COVID, 
we’re learning

14
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,700
that everything is virtual. 
So, trying to also embrace that.

15
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,700
Yeah. I’m sure you 
did the Passover

16
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,700
also via Zoom together 
with all the family.

17
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,700
Unbelievable. Unbelievable. 
Really unique.

18
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,700
So, Mor, it’s such a unique 
privilege to speak with you.

19
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,700
I went through 8200 for 5 years.

20
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,300
You’re running EISP, 
which you’ll tell me what

21
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,700
it’s about in a second. 
But it’s very,

22
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,300
very relevant to 8200.

23
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,700
But you also have 
a very technical background

24
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,700
yourself as software engineer 
from VMware.

25
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,300
And I’m fascinated 
to hear about your intersection

26
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,300
between running an incredible 
community and accelerators,

27
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:41,700
such as EISP, while also being 
technical yourself,

28
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,700
and how does this all 
relate to also women in tech,

29
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,700
which is also something 
you’re very passionate about.

30
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,700
Let’s just get started. 
What is EISP?

31
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,300
Yeah, perfect. 
So, we're starting from the end,

32
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:57,700
actually, but we’ll get to the 
beginning probably again.

33
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,700
So, the EISP is a startup 
accelerator in Israel.

34
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,700
It was founded 
by the 8200 Alumni Association

35
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,700
10 years ago when actually 
the ecosystem in Israel --

36
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,700
it was already a good ecosystem 
but there were not so many

37
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:16,700
formal programs for entrepreneurs 
in their early stages.

38
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,700
So, it was one of the first.

39
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,300
And it is one of the leading 
ones in Israel today.

40
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,700
Yeah.

41
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,300
So, we -- early staged 
entrepreneurs helping them

42
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,000
build and grow their ventures. 
And we have some

43
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,900
great companies in our portfolio.

44
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,900
So, why is 8200 a part of it,

45
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,900
because my understanding 
is that it’s not exclusively

46
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,900
for the 8200. 
And for anybody

47
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,300
who doesn’t know 8200, 
it’s the cyber security considered

48
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,900
like the elite unit of the army 
for the computer nerds like we are.

49
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:49,300
True. So, I think like 
when the Alumni Association

50
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,300
started to think about activities 
and what they can do

51
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:56,300
in the Israeli society 
and help Israel society --

52
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,900
so you said it's 
a very elite tech unit.

53
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,900
But then, when you 
look at the industry,

54
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,900
a lot of the startups 
that were founded in --

55
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,900
and the good ones in Israel 
were founded by 8200 Alumni.

56
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,900
So, it was very natural to think 
about the entrepreneurship

57
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,900
and the innovation ecosystems, 
and see how we can

58
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,900
contribute there.

59
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,900
And then, at first,

60
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,900
they thought about, 
okay, so within the 8200 unit,

61
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,900
you get great skillset.

62
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,700
You get great experience 
and you get a great network,

63
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,000
which helps you along the way 
throughout your career.

64
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,020
And also, once we get to it, 
you will see how it also

65
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,700
help mine.

66
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:40,900
But the other people who are not 
necessarily serving in these units,

67
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,400
Yeah.

68
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,300
they do not benefit 
from the same --

69
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,300
being part of this community.

70
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,300
So, the logic was let’s do 
the other way around.

71
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,300
So usually, alumni association, 
they work for their own alumni.

72
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:57,300
And the 8200 Alumni Association 
decided to work for Israel

73
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:02,700
community and society 
as a whole and taking this closed

74
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,700
network of 8200 alumni 
and open it to any

75
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,700
Israeli entrepreneur.

76
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,700
And this is kind of the DNA 
of the program

77
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,700
and the alumni association itself.

78
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,000
Very nice. Okay. 
So now, how are you

79
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
related to that --? 
And you mentioned that it also

80
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,700
very much impacted your own 
upbringing into the tech world.

81
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,700
True. So, I think that ever since 
I was very, very young,

82
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,700
I was always very 
passionate about tech.

83
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,000
And I always thought that 
I would like to pursue

84
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,700
a career in tech.

85
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,700
So, obviously I know that 
you’re also an 8200 alumni,

86
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,700
so you know.

87
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,700
So, when I was like 16, 
I started the process

88
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,200
to get in track 
in today’s Israeli defense forces.

89
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,900
And after passing so many 
interviews and exams,

90
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,000
I was accepted to the 8200 unit.

91
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,900
I did the intelligence 
force there,

92
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:04,000
which really opened 
my mind to the wonderful things

93
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,300
you can do with technology.

94
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,700
After the army, I studied also 
Computer Science and Statistics.

95
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,700
So, I wanted to get more 
the theoretical

96
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,000
understanding of how things --

97
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,700
how to think correctly about 
solving problems in general,

98
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,700
but also specifically 
like tech problems.

99
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,700
And then, I was working for 
a while as a software engineer.

100
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,700
I think that along the way, 
I understood that

101
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,300
a lot of the skillset 
that I gained from being

102
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,300
a software engineer could also 
benefit in other roles

103
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,700
and other industries.

104
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,700
And then, I wanted 
to tap into the more --

105
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,700
- the business –
- A little bit about that

106
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,300
though, Mor. 
I had to stop you.

107
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:48,900
Yeah, that’s fine, actually.

108
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,900
This idea --

109
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,900
because I agree completely. 
This idea that the skillsets

110
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,300
you’re getting as a software 
engineer are indirectly

111
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,700
very relevant to 
a lot of other industries.

112
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,700
What’s your take on that?

113
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,700
So, I absolutely agree.

114
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,300
And along the way, 
and throughout my career,

115
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,700
I think time and time again, 
I see that this is true.

116
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,000
So, basically everyone thinks 
that being a software engineer

117
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,700
is like programming.

118
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,700
But it’s more than that.

119
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,700
It starts with getting 
a vague problem.

120
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,700
You have to do something 
that you don’t necessarily know

121
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,700
how to approach to or what to do,

122
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,200
and then doing it 
very efficiently

123
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,700
and doing it --

124
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,200
So, you have a vague problem.

125
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,200
You have to break it 
into little components.

126
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Think about each of them.

127
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,200
Do a lot of iterations.

128
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,200
Make it better. 
Make it more efficient.

129
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,700
And then, I think once you have 
that logical and very structured

130
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,300
way of thinking about 
problems in general

131
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,300
and approaching challenges, 
if you know how to also

132
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,700
implement that in other 
industries and in other roles,

133
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,700
so this really help.

134
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,000
So, after working 
as a software engineer,

135
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,700
I went to strategy consulting, 
which is almost 180.

136
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,700
And there, I really saw it 
because you’re coming...

137
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,700
You're coming 
for a very short while.

138
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,700
You’re joining a company 
for like three months

139
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,700
and you have like an enormous 
scope of work.

140
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,700
Your work is like 
you have to basically

141
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:26,000
come up with a new strategy 
to a company who is working

142
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,300
for 30 years.

143
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,300
Everything is great. 
They are growing,

144
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,700
but now, something 
is missing or there --

145
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,000
they want to be better.

146
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,700
And then, you have to understand 
how to break it and understand

147
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,700
where are the --

148
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,700
what are the main issues, 
what hypothesis you can make.

149
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,700
Challenge all kinds of 
assumptions that they have.

150
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,700
And this way of thinking 
really helped me also

151
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
as a strategy consultant.

152
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,700
I mean, this whole idea, 
this magnificent idea

153
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,700
that you’re taking a huge, 
huge problem, anything in life --

154
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:04,000
it can be an algorithm, 
but it can be a leadership

155
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,700
position or strategy.

156
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,300
And this methodology 
of breaking it down,

157
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,300
of divide them and conquer, 
and then piecing them together

158
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,300
back to understand 
everything is manageable.

159
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,300
It’s only a mindset of how 
efficient they are able to

160
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:20,300
divide it, and then conquer it. 
I think that’s just phenomenal.

161
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,300
So, you went to strategy.

162
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,300
You did those consulting, 
which I think is --

163
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,900
That’s definitely something that 
I look forward to experiencing

164
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,300
one day as well because 
you’re coming in,

165
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,300
you’re getting these really 
interesting insights.

166
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,300
And then, you go into 
the accelerator phase

167
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,300
or the community phase, right?

168
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,300
So -- yeah...

169
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,300
So, this is almost the story.

170
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,300
This is very --

171
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,300
So, I always knew that 
in some point,

172
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,300
I would like to take 
the experience that I’ve gained

173
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,300
as a business and strategy 
consultant and go back into

174
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:56,300
the tech world because 
this was my starting position.

175
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,300
This is really who I am, 
basically.

176
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,300
And then, I didn’t know 
how it will connect,

177
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,300
but I knew it will connect 
at some point.

178
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:12,300
I actually planned to go 
and pursue an MBA.

179
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,700
- Really?
- But then -- Yeah.

180
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,300
But then, I met Sharin,

181
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,700
which you know very well.

182
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,700
She was the previous 
managing director.

183
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,700
My ancestor, let’s say.

184
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,200
[laughs]

185
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,700
And she --

186
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,700
We met.

187
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,300
And then, she offered -- 
like a few months after we met,

188
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,000
she offered me this role, 
which totally changed everything

189
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,700
for me because 
I was really on a --

190
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,000
like, I already had 
my application written.

191
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,300
[unclear] did everything 
and it was like around August,

192
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,700
which is very close 
to the deadlines.

193
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,300
And then, 
it took me like a few --

194
00:23:54,300 --> 00:24:00,700
I think like 48 hours to think 
about that and I felt that this is

195
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,700
exactly the opportunity 
that I’ve been waiting for

196
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:11,300
in that time in my career, 
to take a tech experience

197
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,700
together with my 
consultant experience,

198
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,700
combining them to assist 
the early-stage entrepreneurs.

199
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,700
And I’m very happy that I did that.

200
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,700
So, Mor, how many entrepreneurs 
did you get to work with

201
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,700
personally throughout 
your time at EISP?

202
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:34,700
So, the ones that were part 
of like the cohort that I led,

203
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,700
around let’s say, 30.

204
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,700
But then, obviously, we support 
our alumni community,

205
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:47,700
which is like 120 startups 
in different stages,

206
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,700
different verticals, which is 
a whole different challenge.

207
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,700
And then, on my spare time,

208
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,700
if I have that,

209
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,700
I like helping other entrepreneurs 
who did not --

210
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,700
who were not accepted 
to our program.

211
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,000
I think it’s very important 
to give them the proper feedback

212
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,700
and try to help if you have 
the network and the experience.

213
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,700
Try to help wherever you can.

214
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,300
Amazing! No, I actually have 
two great friends

215
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,000
who did the program recently, 
Tomer Zuaretz and Imri Hecht.

216
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Oh, I love him. Wow. Oh, man.

217
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,700
He actually sat next to me in the 
army for about a year and a half.

218
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,700
We were on the same team. 
Incredible. Incredible people.

219
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,700
And they just mentioned 
how incredible the program is.

220
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,700
So, what are sort of the values 
that you bring into the program?

221
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,700
When you look at an accelerator 
and you look at the 150

222
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,700
entrepreneurs that have 
gone through this program,

223
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,700
what makes it unique 
versus any other accelerator

224
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,700
that just aims to kickstart 
the progress of these

225
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,700
early-stage startups?

226
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:55,700
Yeah. So, I think, first of all, 
is the reputation that we have.

227
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,700
- Yeah.
- And the --

228
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,700
We’ve been operating 
for 10 years.

229
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,700
There are, I think, very little 
like other startups --

230
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,700
not a lot of startups 
in the Israeli ecosystem

231
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,700
that have been operating 
for that long.

232
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,700
And this means that 
we have a lot of experience.

233
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,700
- So --
- Yeah.

234
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,700
from cycle to cycle, year to year, 
managing director to other,

235
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,700
we really --

236
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,700
We evolve. We learn.

237
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,700
We’re getting better.

238
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,700
So, I think today, if you ask –

239
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,700
More than that, Mor, 
I think you actually have

240
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,700
the opportunity -- 
unlike other accelerators,

241
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,300
you see the whole life cycle 
from inception to,

242
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,000
potentially, 
exit because the average

243
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,300
life cycle of a startup 
is seven to nine years.

244
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,300
So, you actually get to 
now debrief over your initial

245
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,300
cohorts and see, "Okay, 
what happened over these

246
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,700
seven to nine years?"

247
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,700
True. So, we have the data 
and we’re following the data.

248
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,700
And we’re seeing like --

249
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,200
Wonderful.

250
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,300
We’re trying to learn from that, 
which companies

251
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,300
we can help and which 
companies we --

252
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,300
We did the right --

253
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,300
We selected them properly.

254
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,700
And we have some 
companies who already --

255
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,700
as you said, they already exited.

256
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,700
And I think --

257
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,700
So, first is the experience, 
your reputation.

258
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,700
Second, it’s the network.

259
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,700
So, we’re not only 
approaching 8200 alumni,

260
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,300
but the background 
is 8200 alumni.

261
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,700
And within that network 
in Israel and also

262
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,000
in Silicon Valley, San Francisco, 
and all around the world,

263
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,700
there is a strong community 
which is very united.

264
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,700
I’m sure you’re taking part 
in the activity of the community.

265
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,700
- Definitely.
- Yeah. So, we --

266
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,000
we really --

267
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,700
they’re really up for 
the challenge

268
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,000
to assist entrepreneurs. 
And whenever I approach someone

269
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,700
from the network, they’re always, 
always happy to assist----

270
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,700
opening doors, giving consultation, mentoring the startups,

271
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,700
which is a really great network 
to have for entrepreneurs.

272
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,700
We’re a non-profit organization, 
which is different

273
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,700
from other startups.

274
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,700
It’s very different from 
other accelerators, right?

275
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,700
It’s very uncommon.

276
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,700
True. Every year, 
we think about that,

277
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,700
whether we want to raise a fund 
and start investing

278
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,700
or we want to be --

279
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,700
we want to stay a non-profit.

280
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,700
So, we do not take equity.

281
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,700
We do not invest, which is nice.

282
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,700
But I think that, more than that, 
it means that we are --

283
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,700
we don’t have a specific agenda.

284
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,700
We really want to do 
what’s best for the company.

285
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,700
I think that if you’re backed by 
a specific VC

286
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,700
or backed by a corporate, 
so obviously, you want to

287
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:31,700
promote their agenda 
or their specific requirements.

288
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,700
And here, 
really, if an entrepreneur

289
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,700
wants to raise money, 
he doesn’t have any obligation.

290
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,700
I will introduce him to all 
the VCs that are relevant to him

291
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,700
and all the investors.

292
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:47,700
And if he’s not committed 
to any specific VC,

293
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,700
which I think is really great --

294
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,700
and if –

295
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,700
In Israel, as you know, 
now with the situation,

296
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,700
everything shifts a bit.

297
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,700
But money is not an issue 
if you’re a good entrepreneur.

298
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,700
It’s just come to the investors 
at the right timing.

299
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,000
And sometimes, 
if you go to an accelerator,

300
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,700
it means that you 
still need to be --

301
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,700
you need to be -- 
to do some polishing.

302
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,700
But you have amazing raw material.

303
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,000
And then, if you go to investors,

304
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,700
then you would probably won’t 
get the best deal.

305
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,000
So, I think that getting money 
from accelerators is

306
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,700
not necessarily the best thing 
for the company.

307
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,000
Yeah. Well, my que --

308
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,700
So, I’m going to challenge 
you on that because I’m wondering –

309
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,700
Go ahead.

310
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,700
Do you think that there are some 
startups that might be hesitant

311
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:40,000
to join or to apply to 8200, 
to this accelerator because of

312
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
the fact that you’re 
not taking equity?

313
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,700
Because they might feel that if 
you don’t have a stake

314
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,000
in their company, then maybe 
you’re not going to give them

315
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,700
as much attention 
as other accelerators,

316
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,700
or that you’re not going to be 
as advocative in helping

317
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,700
connect them? 
Or is that not even

318
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,700
a worry for startups, because a -- 
because this accelerator

319
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,700
is one of the best well-known 
accelerators in the country?

320
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,300
Yeah. So, that’s 
a good question, actually.

321
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,700
We always ask 
the other way around.

322
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,700
We always think that --

323
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,700
So, you’re asking if --

324
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:14,700
because we’re not putting money 
or taking any equity,

325
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,700
so we will not invest --

326
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,700
we will not do 
our best to help them –

327
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,700
Maybe [inaudible] both. 
I don’t know.

328
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,700
Yeah.

329
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,700
I’m not sure if that’s a concern. 
I never heard an entrepreneur

330
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,700
who is worried about 
the program because of that.

331
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:32,700
And this leads me to the already 
good results that we

332
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,000
have talking to --

333
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
even if you talk to Tomer, 
I’m sure he will be

334
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,700
able to tell you --

335
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,700
And he was one of our --

336
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,700
He’s amazing.
I’m sure he would have succeeded

337
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,700
without our help.

338
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:50,700
But being able to introduce him 
to so many investors and also

339
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,700
potential customers was really --

340
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,700
I’m sure it really helped him. 
But I don’t think --

341
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,200
I think if they do have any --

342
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,700
if entrepreneurs 
have this concern,

343
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,300
they talk to me. 
I’m very, very approachable.

344
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,700
I love talking to entrepreneurs 
or other alumni in our portfolio.

345
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,700
And then, I’m sure they won’t 
be worried about that.

346
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,700
Oh, I love it. 
At the end, it’s all about

347
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,300
what’s actually happening 
on the field and I’m seeing

348
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,700
all these incredible things that 
you’re doing for the startups.

349
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,700
I’m observing in social media. 
And I’m talking to Tomer

350
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,700
and Imri, and all my friends 
who are doing it and it’s li --

351
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,700
it is one of the best run 
accelerators that I’ve seen.

352
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,700
There are so many accelerators 
that people come out and

353
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,740
they tell me, 
“Michael, we did this.

354
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,700
"We actually quit
accelerators."

355
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,700
"We feel like, 
'Ah, it was worth it,'

356
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,700
and 'not so worth it.'”

357
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,000
I only heard rave reviews about 
what you’re doing there.

358
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,700
We just have a few minutes, 
and I thought this was a shame.

359
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,000
But I’d love to get a little bit 
about your passion

360
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,300
for women in tech. 
And then, I’m going to --

361
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,700
and then, we’ll shift it to a few 
more things that I have in mind.

362
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,700
Ah, so let’s go. 
Let’s try to do it quick.

363
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,700
20 minutes goes by 
really fast when you enjoy –

364
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,300
- Time flies. It’s unbelievable.
- Yeah. [laughs]

365
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,700
So, women in tech.

366
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,700
So, one of my personal passion 
is about that. So I'm a woman,

367
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,700
I'm coming from tech. 
I know how --

368
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,700
most of my time, 
I was one of the few

369
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,700
during university.

370
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:15,700
Then looking at the industry, 
there are only around 3% in Israel,

371
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,700
3% female entrepreneurs.

372
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,700
This is something that 
I care deeply about.

373
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,700
And I think starting 
with education,

374
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,700
where I believe you need 
to start there;

375
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:29,000
so teaching young girls, 
opening their minds

376
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,700
- to this kind of field.
- How young do they start?

377
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,700
At what age do you think is 
important to really get in there?

378
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:40,700
From like age zero almost.

379
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,200
Yeah, so all the way 
from the beginning.

380
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,300
- into this -- it's -- okay.
- Yeah.

381
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:48,000
Like exposing them to things 
that are more mechanical,

382
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,700
scientific.

383
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,700
And then, also obviously, 
encourage them to explore these

384
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,300
ideas as parents and as educator.

385
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,700
I’m actually asking that 
because I read recently,

386
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,300
a very interesting study that 
showed that actually up until

387
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:08,300
a certain age, girls outperform 
boys in STEM.

388
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,700
But I think at around fifth 
or sixth grade,

389
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,700
there are these social norms

390
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,000
that are starting to 
divide the groups.

391
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,700
And a lot of scientists are 
saying that if we can dive into

392
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,300
that key moment in the 
middle school when

393
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,700
they have these cliques, 
maybe that will help

394
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,700
change the situation. 
I’ll send it to you later.

395
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,700
I thought it was very interesting.

396
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,700
Oh, I’d love to read that.

397
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,700
So, it’s very complex, obviously, 
because also, as you said,

398
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,700
there is this social environment.

399
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,700
At the age of 10 or 11, 
if you’re not with other girls,

400
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,700
you might feel a bit different 
or strange.

401
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,700
But then, obviously, 
I think you should start

402
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,700
from the beginning.

403
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,700
My father is very feminist.

404
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:50,000
He was always like that, 
which really helped me

405
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,700
I think from a very young age 
to understand that there is --

406
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,000
I can do anything, basically. 
I just need to understand what

407
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,700
I want to do 
and where is my passion.

408
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,700
But I think that starting 
with the parents,

409
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:07,300
this is the point where you 
should start encouraging girls

410
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,700
explore these areas.

411
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,700
I love it, Mor. Last question. 
Well, actually, I lied,

412
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,700
I have two more questions.

413
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,700
But for now, where do you see 
yourself in like 10, 15 years?

414
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,700
Curiosity -- I mean, 
are you doing a startup?

415
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,700
Are you going into --

416
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,700
working for a big company? 
Where’s your passion?

417
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:27,700
Wow! Wish I was brave enough 
to start a startup.

418
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,700
It’s so crazy. 
I really admire entrepreneurs.

419
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,700
No, no, no, after each --

420
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,700
after you’re seeing all these 
people go through it?

421
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:41,700
So, I do, but I think I like 
being an entrepreneur

422
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,700
and being a --
like taking initiatives within

423
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,700
a more structured environment.

424
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,700
So, this is where -- 
like at the moment,

425
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,700
this is where I feel more --

426
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:59,700
like, this is where 
I feel comfortable.

427
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,700
So, definitely continue 
to work with entrepreneurs.

428
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:11,000
I’m not sure how exactly, 
but definitely I’m super --

429
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,700
I love working 
with entrepreneurs,

430
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,700
like seeing them, 
how they are passionate about

431
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,700
what they’re doing, 
trying to change the world

432
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:23,700
and how I can assist doing that 
definitely fulfills

433
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,700
a lot of the things 
that I’m looking for in a career.

434
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,700
I love it, Mor.

435
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,700
- Now the last question, finally. 
- Yeah. [laughs]

436
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,700
I need three words 
that best describe you

437
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,700
or that any of your startups 
would describe you as.

438
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,700
[laughs]

439
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,700
I’m sure these 
would be different, three words.

440
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,700
So, I think I’m very -- 
I’m ambitious.

441
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:51,700
I have very high 
emotional intelligence.

442
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,700
And I think that I’m very Israeli

443
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,700
- in every sense of the word. 
- Yeah, I agree.

444
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,700
Yeah, yeah, really.

445
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,300
[laughs]

446
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,000
Mor, this is --
I’ve done it

447
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,300
with quite a few Israelis. 
This is the first time

448
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,700
I’m hearing that as a word. 
I just love it. Toda raba.

449
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,700
Thank you so much. 
Toda. I really enjoyed

450
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,700
getting to know you. 
Really enjoyed.

451
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,700
- Thank you. 
- Take care.
