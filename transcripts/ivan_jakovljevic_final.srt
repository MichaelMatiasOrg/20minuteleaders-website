1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,800
A lot of times we think about the way

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,560
that we do business,

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,760
it kind of developed countries

4
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,640
that we're like, well, you know,

5
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,800
we're going to do it in an efficient way.

6
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,680
We'll just jump on a call

7
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,920
and kind of get things done.

8
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,400
Well, that's not

9
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,600
typically how things work

10
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,320
in a lot of other countries in the region

11
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,440
and you kind of need to be sensitive

12
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,400
to all of these nuances

13
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,090
if you want to actually be successful.

14
00:00:43,357 --> 00:00:44,113
Ivan Jakovljevic,

15
00:00:44,114 --> 00:00:45,440
thank you so much for joining me.

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,240
How are you?

17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,640
I'm very good, thank you.

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,240
Good to be here with you in Dubai.

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,960
It's wonderful to be here in Dubai.

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,000
So, we have a whole new set of you know,

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,560
I've been doing this

22
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,960
over Zoom for 250 episodes.

23
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,640
And done one episode in person.

24
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,920
This is my second one.

25
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,760
And I'm honored to do it

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,600
with you here in Dubai.

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,640
Thank you for joining me.

28
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,120
Absolutely.

29
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,160
Great to have you here.

30
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,880
Ivan, we are in

31
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,120
the beautiful Emirates Tower.

32
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,520
I don't think

33
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,640
that we can really see it here,

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,200
but I'm just going to show it anyway.

35
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,240
The incredible view of Dubai,

36
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,600
really a phenomenal place of innovation.

37
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,720
I've been shocked and blown away

38
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,440
by what's happening in this place.

39
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,560
Ivan, how did you get to Dubai?

40
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,151
Because you've done

41
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,960
Stanford Business School.

42
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,160
You're originally from Serbia.

43
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,240
You've spent many years in Google.

44
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,720
How do you end up helping run investments

45
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,440
and portfolio companies in Dubai?

46
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,720
Short answer, by chance, obviously.

47
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,040
Right?

48
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,440
So, the story is as follows.

49
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,960
I'm originally from Serbia,

50
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,600
as you mentioned.

51
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,640
So, I moved to the states to do Stanford

52
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
Graduate School of Business.

53
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,920
That was back in 2006.

54
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,840
After graduating,

55
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,360
I joined the consulting firm

56
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,120
and moved to the city of San Francisco.

57
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,120
And back in the day,

58
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,880
my thinking was essentially like,

59
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,240
kind of follow my American dream, right?

60
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,840
All I have to do is kind of you know,

61
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,200
have a couple of kids,

62
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,840
two and a half kids,

63
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,960
to be more precise,

64
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,000
white picket fence, a dog,

65
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and I should be all set, right?

66
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,080
Except that somehow life worked out.

67
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,760
So, after a couple of years in consulting

68
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,920
in 2008, you know,

69
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,360
there was the global financial crisis

70
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,640
and markets kind of started to rumble

71
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,520
a little bit.

72
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,400
And the firm that I was with at the time,

73
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,440
they were basically looking,

74
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,720
they had a booming

75
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,680
and thriving business here

76
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,600
in the Middle East.

77
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,480
They were looking for people

78
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,400
within the system

79
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,680
to kind of move temporarily

80
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,280
to the Middle East

81
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,320
to kind of help them essentially deliver

82
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:25,920
on all the projects

83
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,920
that they were able to sell.

84
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,520
Right.

85
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,920
So, you know, before I knew it,

86
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,880
I was basically like, you know,

87
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,680
what's the worst thing

88
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,560
that could possibly happen.

89
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,040
I have never been

90
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,080
to the Middle East before, right?

91
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,880
The only thing I knew

92
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,520
about the Middle East

93
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,000
was kind of from six o'clock news.

94
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,280
And that was never a good thing.

95
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,120
Never a good thing.

96
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,200
But I've been thinking like, you know,

97
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,400
it's like the land of eternal sun,

98
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,000
go there, go for a couple of years,

99
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,240
you know, make some tax free money,

100
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
repay my student loans,

101
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,840
and before I knew it,

102
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,320
I was going to be back home.

103
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:50,440
Right?

104
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,400
Or that's at least what I thought.

105
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,280
That was 2008,

106
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,840
fast forward to 12 and a half years.

107
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,080
I guess, you know,

108
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,720
life is temporary as it is,

109
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,600
but it turned out to be

110
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,960
a little bit more temporary than

111
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,960
the original two years idea.

112
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,640
Unbelievable.

113
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,840
So, you joined Google, right?

114
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,400
You spend quite a long time with Google,

115
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,920
helping them expand their market

116
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,200
and grow into

117
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,080
Middle East North African markets.

118
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,880
What is that like?

119
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,280
What does that responsibility entail?

120
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,760
What are some of the biggest challenges

121
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,640
that you've had along that journey?

122
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,480
Yes, one of the things that people

123
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,680
don't necessarily, not understand,

124
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,200
but like comprehend, right,

125
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,440
is we talk about MENA,

126
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,200
which is the Middle East

127
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,040
and North Africa region,

128
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,320
a lot of people kind of talk about it

129
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,080
as kind of a region

130
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,000
which is relatively uniform.

131
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,200
But in reality,

132
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,400
it's anywhere between 19 and 21 countries

133
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,040
depending on the day

134
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,880
and depending on who does the counting,

135
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,840
which are actually very, very different.

136
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,960
So, we sit here in the Gulf

137
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,000
in the emirates of Dubai,

138
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,560
which is part of the

139
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,120
United Arab Emirates,

140
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,720
one of the richest

141
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,480
countries in the world.

142
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,600
For all intents and purposes,

143
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,200
actually a very, very developed country.

144
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,560
But another country in MENA is

145
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,440
it's Egypt, right?

146
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,720
More than 100 million people.

147
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,560
But it's actually kind of more

148
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,000
in the range of developing countries

149
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,600
as opposed to kind of developed countries

150
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,240
and everything that kind

151
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,120
of comes with it.

152
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,360
Kind of from the level of sophistication

153
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,200
and maturity of the markets to the level

154
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,320
if we are talking about digital economy,

155
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,160
you know, the penetration

156
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,600
of mobile phone, Internet, payment,

157
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,280
payment cards and so on and so forth.

158
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,680
It's a very, very diverse region

159
00:04:12,681 --> 00:04:14,000
that actually needs a lot

160
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
of different recipes,

161
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,180
if you will, to kind to be,

162
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:18,120
"flexible business".

163
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,800
So, that was my role

164
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,760
when I joined Google.

165
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,360
So, we were actually

166
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,400
very well established here in the UAE,

167
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,000
but we didn't have

168
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,200
a very, very meaningful footprint

169
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,480
in the rest of the region, right?

170
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,850
So, when I started doing my

171
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,700
regional head of new markets,

172
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:33,120
I went segue being head.

173
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,880
Basically my assignment was essentially

174
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,320
to kind of bring everything

175
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:37,920
that we were able

176
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,720
to build here in the UAE

177
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,200
and to kind of take it further out

178
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,600
into the rest of the region.

179
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,480
And that I mean, at the end,

180
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,680
you have the responsibility

181
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,240
of looking at both the emerging markets,

182
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,000
but also at the developed markets

183
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,560
and playing all these different hats.

184
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,280
Because for every region,

185
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,080
it's not just about

186
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,000
the penetration of the technology,

187
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,440
but it's also about the culture.

188
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,920
And it's about how much do they trust

189
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,560
the payment system,

190
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,360
how much do they trust

191
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,760
digital e-commerce.

192
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,840
And there's a lot of different subtleties

193
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,320
that you really have

194
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,520
to take into account.

195
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,400
Even to the extent I think, covid

196
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,320
is kind of an interesting.

197
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,800
And we're probably

198
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,120
going to talk about that a little bit.

199
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,564
But even in terms of

200
00:05:11,565 --> 00:05:13,920
how you do business, right?

201
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,760
Like in some parts of the region,

202
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,560
some countries in the region, for them,

203
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,400
the working culture

204
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,680
is much more face to face oriented.

205
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,640
There is no way for you

206
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,280
to do business unless

207
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,440
you have kind of first established

208
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,520
a relationship.

209
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,605
Unless you have actually gone

210
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:28,680
a small chitchat and so on,

211
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,360
unless you have gone

212
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,400
and kind of had coffee with them.

213
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,600
Yeah.

214
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,760
And so on and so forth.

215
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:34,560
So, a lot of times we think about

216
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,920
the way that we do business

217
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,120
in kind of develop countries that we're

218
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,760
like, well, you know,

219
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,920
we're going to an efficient way.

220
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,800
We'll just jump on a call

221
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,040
and kind of get things done.

222
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,960
Well, that's not typically

223
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,840
how things work in

224
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,520
a lot of other countries in the region.

225
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,560
You kind of need to be sensitive

226
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,520
to all of these nuances

227
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,600
if you want to actually be successful.

228
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,160
100%.

229
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm used to the fast paced modeling

230
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,720
in San Francisco.

231
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,000
If I'm getting 15 minutes with somebody

232
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,480
from [--]

233
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,720
and I have those first three minutes

234
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,880
to make the impression.

235
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,400
Here one of the first things they told me

236
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,760
when I came to Dubai, they said,

237
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,960
"Michael, before you mention anything

238
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,280
that has to do with technology,

239
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,800
with investments, whatever,

240
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,440
sit down, have a chat, have a coffee,

241
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,360
invest the time in the relationship,

242
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,120
otherwise, nobody wants to do business."

243
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,040
It's a very different mentality.

244
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,360
Do most people fail that

245
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,080
or do most people understand

246
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,520
and make that quick adaptation?

247
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,000
Because the world is getting globalized,

248
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,680
right?

249
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,480
Right now, it still feels

250
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,440
a little bit fragmented

251
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,520
just by the shock factor

252
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,240
that I've exhibited coming here.

253
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,160
But if I'm looking five, 10 years,

254
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,240
even with the normalization with Israel,

255
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,160
things are going to become more connected.

256
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,800
So, how do you expect people are going

257
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,880
to adapt this more business mindset

258
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,880
within two sides?

259
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,960
Yes. So, Dubai is great,

260
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,440
I think in this regard.

261
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,560
And again, I don't know how well known

262
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,960
that is outside of kind of this

263
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,920
this more narrow region.

264
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:45,240
But Dubai is like a true melting pot,

265
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,400
right?

266
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,520
It's like, 190 nationalities.

267
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,080
If you think about the population

268
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,960
segmentation, if you will,

269
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,520
again, I don't know

270
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,640
how many people know that,

271
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,320
but out of three million people in Dubai,

272
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,640
less than 10% are the UAE nationals.

273
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,400
10%?

274
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,360
Less than 10% are UAE nationals, right.

275
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:02,800
Wow.

276
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,720
So, if you think about the likelihood

277
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,800
of you actually bumping into somebody

278
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,440
who's kind of from another country

279
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,120
is like nine out of 10.

280
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,920
And in all likelihood,

281
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,480
they're going to be

282
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,400
from the subcontinent,

283
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,800
they're going to be from Southeast Asia,

284
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,920
they're going to be from Europe or

285
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,800
the UK, less so from the US

286
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,560
and Latin America.

287
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,440
Just kind of from

288
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,120
a geographic distance point of view.

289
00:07:21,121 --> 00:07:21,938
But I think the fact

290
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:22,920
that it's a melting pot

291
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,440
actually kind of gives rise

292
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,920
to this kind of

293
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,680
being kind of attuned, if you will,

294
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,400
by the kind of more sensitive to the fact

295
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,240
that a person sitting across from you

296
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,520
in a business meeting

297
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,640
is not going to be like you

298
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,480
kind of from a cultural point of view.

299
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,600
So, you may not necessarily

300
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,920
understand their culture,

301
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,040
but you're going to be naturally

302
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,280
more attuned to kind of understand

303
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,120
that it's different from yours.

304
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,520
Right?

305
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,200
And to kind of

306
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,320
give them the benefit of the doubt,

307
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,920
unnecessarily jump to conclusions,

308
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,040
kind of get out of your way,

309
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,600
kind of trying to basically kind of get

310
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,880
get to learn a little bit more about,

311
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,640
you know, how to be effective,

312
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,360
how to establish those relationships,

313
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,880
how to build them,

314
00:07:57,881 --> 00:07:59,599
how to get results, right

315
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,080
at the end of the day.

316
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,960
How do you explain

317
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,200
what we're seeing here?

318
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,000
How does it happen,

319
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,160
as soon as I get to Dubai

320
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,200
and seeing these crazy towers,

321
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,760
people seem to be very happy,

322
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,440
very low crime rate,

323
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,760
you know, what's happening here?

324
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,400
Why is Dubai this crazy melting pot

325
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,720
and why do we have this?

326
00:08:15,721 --> 00:08:17,320
Well, I think the Dubai,

327
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,400
the whole story of Dubai

328
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,560
is really about, and you know,

329
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,880
the way to think about Dubai

330
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,880
is not even related to the MENA region.

331
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,080
It's the way to think about it

332
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,040
is kind of the headquarters of that hub,

333
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,600
if you will, of a very,

334
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,520
very broad region,

335
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,640
which actually comprises

336
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,120
almost two billion people.

337
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,640
And the way that they've kind of set up

338
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
and actually kind of started

339
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,560
from the logistics.

340
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,520
So, before Dubai was what it was in 1971,

341
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,960
they've built what is to become

342
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,880
one of the largest ports in the world,

343
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,157
which is DP World in Jebel Ali

344
00:08:47,158 --> 00:08:47,720
which is like

345
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,920
20 miles down the road, right.

346
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,760
And at that time,

347
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,040
there was literally nothing.

348
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,360
I mean, the Dubai, it was more like

349
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,560
a fishing village with like

350
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,800
50 thousand people.

351
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,960
But it was a vision to say that

352
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,880
from a geographic point of view,

353
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,760
it is a hub that is kind of logistically

354
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,600
and distance wise within

355
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,520
a seven to eight hour flight radius,

356
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,320
to more than two billion people.

357
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,520
So, it's a good place to put a port.

358
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,040
And it turned out to be the case.

359
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,760
It's a good place

360
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,200
to actually put an airport in

361
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,600
like an international airport.

362
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,240
And today, Dubai International Airport

363
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,140
is actually the largest

364
00:09:21,141 --> 00:09:22,760
international airport in the world.

365
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,280
Actually.

366
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,040
You've probably heard

367
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,160
about Emirates Airlines.

368
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,960
It's the biggest international airline

369
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
in the world in terms

370
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
of the number of connections,

371
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
in terms of number of people.

372
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
They're kind of transporting,

373
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,360
hopping back and forth.

374
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,880
So, think of Dubai as a hub.

375
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,640
So, if you then think about

376
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,200
that broader region that Dubai,

377
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,080
the Dubai covers as a hub,

378
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,640
you have places like India,

379
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,400
you have places like Saudi Arabia,

380
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
places like Dubai or places like,

381
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,960
you know, southeast in the south

382
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,920
and east to Eastern Europe,

383
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,680
even to CIS countries, right,

384
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,040
all kind of somewhat naturally gravitated

385
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,480
towards a place

386
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,000
that has established itself

387
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,720
as not only a logistics hub,

388
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,800
but also a hub that it is very convenient

389
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,600
and very safe to do business in.

390
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:03,920
Right?

391
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,080
From the kind of safety and security

392
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,480
perspective,

393
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,840
but also kind of from a regulation

394
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,320
perspective,

395
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,480
because they put in a lot of

396
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,600
kind of a very

397
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,240
sort of regulatory framework around,

398
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,520
you know, just kind of allowing it

399
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,200
to do business

400
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,760
with the rest of the region.

401
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,080
Unbelievable.

402
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,920
And so, you have a place

403
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,880
of three million people,

404
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,040
90% of them are not even local,

405
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,440
and it's become the hub of the region

406
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,080
that encompasses two billion people.

407
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,760
That's right.

408
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,720
That's just unbelievable.

409
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,480
I don't think that not even myself

410
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,720
or many of my friends I have are actually

411
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,200
understanding what's happening here.

412
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,400
What's going to happen in the future?

413
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,080
If you look at this,

414
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,240
if you look at this whole region, MENA,

415
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,280
the world with Dubai as a hub,

416
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,880
what's going to happen

417
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,000
20 years down the line?

418
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,600
Because the world

419
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,240
is becoming more and more globalized.

420
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,280
I've just experienced it now

421
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,400
because the two nations are normalized.

422
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,320
But what's going to happen

423
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,440
in the future, do you think?

424
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,600
Well, it's anyone's guess right,

425
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
at the end of the day.

426
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,320
But I think the vision,

427
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,200
and we're talking about

428
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
the pre-covid world,

429
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,600
I think it remains to be seen

430
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,880
what kind of adventures

431
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,880
that the covid are going to throw into,

432
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,440
everything is happening.

433
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,320
But the whole underlying idea

434
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,080
is that probably like,

435
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,800
you know, from this

436
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,440
kind of a grand vision perspective,

437
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,760
we're probably not even like 30% there.

438
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,360
Really?

439
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,160
So, you know, again,

440
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,320
like the emerging markets

441
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,000
are the ones that are

442
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,160
kind of up and coming.

443
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,400
Right?

444
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,120
And we can provide them with talent,

445
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,000
technology,

446
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,760
financial and regulatory framework.

447
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,200
What London and New York have

448
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,320
for the rest of the world,

449
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,680
Dubai aspires to be for

450
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,480
this kind of part of the world

451
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,440
in between Hong Kong and London.

452
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,760
So, all of these things,

453
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,800
I think they've just scratched

454
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,960
the surface of.

455
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,680
If you think about

456
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,520
what is happening in Africa, for example,

457
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,040
which is projected to have more than one,

458
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,040
one and a half billion people, right,

459
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,320
all kind of emerging from poverty

460
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,360
and at some point,

461
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,960
if these economies

462
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,720
kind of start picking up,

463
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,080
Dubai is perfectly positioned

464
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,018
to actually kind of leverage

465
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:43,480
and kind of profit to all of that.

466
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,280
So, I think the vision still stands.

467
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,200
Again, covid and financial crisis,

468
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,840
they're kind of throwing

469
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,920
a couple of wrenches.

470
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,720
But if you think about the macro trends,

471
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,520
and if those macro trends continue,

472
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,840
I think Dubai is very well-positioned

473
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,880
to benefit from that.

474
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,840
That's interesting.

475
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,240
And I know that you have to go to,

476
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,160
you have a hard stop soon.

477
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,920
But I have to understand a little bit

478
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,560
about the tech ecosystem

479
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,200
with investments.

480
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,160
So, right now, you're leading

481
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,800
chief development officer,

482
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,560
part of STV Saudi.

483
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,440
Technology Ventures, yeah.

484
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,320
Saudi Technology Ventures.

485
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,080
So, you are investing

486
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,080
all across the Middle East

487
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,160
and North Africa.

488
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,280
Give me a little bit of an overview.

489
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,000
Because I know

490
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Silicon Valley pretty well,

491
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,760
I know the United States

492
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,600
and I know Tel Aviv.

493
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,200
I don't know this region.

494
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,920
What's happening here

495
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,840
in terms of technology?

496
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,400
And how does it fare

497
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
in comparison to more

498
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,320
of the Western world

499
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,440
on what's happening there?

500
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,320
Yeah. So, listen, the market here

501
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,440
in kind of from a startup point of view

502
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,360
is super nascent, right?

503
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,840
So, I'll give you

504
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,720
just one way to think about it, right.

505
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,880
In terms of the overall amount

506
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,680
of venture funding,

507
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,880
US probably stands at around

508
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,960
100 billion, give or take.

509
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,400
Right?

510
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,760
Places like India are at around

511
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,160
10 to 12 billion, give or take a year.

512
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,360
We are probably hitting our

513
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,800
one billion mark over this year.

514
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,440
So, kind of from

515
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,200
an order of magnitude perspective,

516
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,440
it's still super small

517
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,320
and very, very nascent.

518
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,560
And there are

519
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,560
a number of reasons for that.

520
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,840
I think one of the big reasons for that

521
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,640
is that the economies here,

522
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,560
historically were essentially driven

523
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,320
by large organizations, right?

524
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,120
By the extraction of hydrocarbons,

525
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,920
obviously large companies in the world.

526
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,400
Saudi Aramco is kind of

527
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,040
the oil company

528
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,240
that extracts oil from the ground

529
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,160
and so on and so forth.

530
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,120
A lot of things here

531
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,680
also from an economic point of view

532
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,800
are driven by trade,

533
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,960
which is dominated

534
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,080
by the large family

535
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,440
of conglomerates and all that.

536
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,840
So, if you think about SME or kind of

537
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,560
this whole kind of sentiment around,

538
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,160
starting from the ground up

539
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,640
and having this

540
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,800
kind of a entrepreneurial mindset,

541
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,280
if you will, in kind of making it big

542
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,120
in the world,

543
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,200
it wasn't necessarily

544
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:43,000
at present, the best here, right?

545
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,720
The regulations

546
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,120
were not supporting it either.

547
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,680
The culture was not supporting it either.

548
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,320
You know, we kind of take for granted

549
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,040
this whole kind of start fail fast,

550
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,280
but then kind of were the scars

551
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,800
of that failure

552
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,600
is kind of a learning experience

553
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,240
and kind of something

554
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,360
that you are proud of, right?

555
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,520
Here in this region,

556
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,560
failure was associated,

557
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,560
there was kind of a negative

558
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,760
connotation to it, right?

559
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,560
So, from a cultural point of view,

560
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,520
regulatory point of view,

561
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,560
economic point of view,

562
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,440
it wasn't a place where, you know,

563
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,800
startups or the kind of

564
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,080
the emergent kind of ecosystem economy

565
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,560
would thrive.

566
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,840
All of this is changing

567
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,480
and all of this

568
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,480
is changing super, super fast.

569
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:17,640
Right?

570
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,120
So, again, I've told you about

571
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,360
the one billion dollar mark

572
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,720
in venture funding,

573
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,600
but it's actually kind of

574
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,520
on the back of 50 million

575
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,440
that was invested only five years ago.

576
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,040
So, it's literally kind of an,

577
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,560
it's getting kind of exponential growth.

578
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,640
And the reason for me to actually move

579
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,800
from Google to a place like STV,

580
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,160
with all the branding differences

581
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,640
and obviously kind of the safety

582
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,680
and all the other differences

583
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,560
is kind of looking at that opportunity

584
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,240
as super nascent opportunity.

585
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:50,720
Right?

586
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,200
Essentially, I was telling myself was,

587
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,720
you know, do I want to be there

588
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,640
not only to witness it,

589
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,360
but potentially participate in it

590
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,720
and enable it?

591
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,640
And the clear answer is yes.

592
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,280
And basically,

593
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,840
I told myself I was probably too late

594
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,120
to do that in the Silicon Valley

595
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,680
back in 2006.

596
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,440
But I think I'm probably

597
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,400
not too late here.

598
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,160
Because it's just starting.

599
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,680
I wanted to kind of make

600
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,480
a good use of that.

601
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,080
See the exponential curve.

602
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,280
Ivan, I know we have to go.

603
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,760
And this is a,

604
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,240
I'm keeping you very late.

605
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,200
But thank you so, so much

606
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,400
for joining me on this show.

607
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,040
It's really wonderful.

608
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,960
And I'm so excited to share this

609
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,120
with my friends, with my family.

610
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,760
And I already learned so much.

611
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,400
Ivan, before we leave,

612
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:24,880
I have to ask you

613
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,120
the most difficult question,

614
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,092
which I didn't prepare you for.

615
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,560
So, I'm sorry, but I need three words

616
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,080
that you would use to describe yourself

617
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,920
or anybody at STV or in MENA region

618
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,880
would describe Ivan as.

619
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,800
Interesting.

620
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,640
Father.

621
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,080
Yeah.

622
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,840
I'm a father of three.

623
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,920
Three boys that I'm very proud of.

624
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,760
You wanted two and a half.

625
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,240
So, one of them--

626
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,120
I wanted two and a half,

627
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,800
I really wasn't sure

628
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,280
if I would have ended up on

629
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,800
on one side or the other.

630
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,720
I think the second one is passionate.

631
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,960
Passionate about helping people,

632
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,720
passionate about educating people,

633
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,440
passionate about growing people.

634
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,800
And the third one would be,

635
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,320
it's kind of related to the first one,

636
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,160
but it's family, really.

637
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,143
And not only my immediate family,

638
00:16:13,151 --> 00:16:15,100
but also my broader family as well.

639
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:15,930
I love it.

640
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:17,080
Ivan, Thank you so much.

641
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:17,906
Elbow bump.

642
00:16:17,907 --> 00:16:19,528
Say hi to everyone

643
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:20,400
at Stanford for me, please.

644
00:16:20,401 --> 00:16:21,305
Will do, thank you.
