1 Ayal Yogev, thank you so much for being on my show. How are you? Good, good. Thank you for having me. Of course. So, incredible journey that I can't wait to dive into, whether it's from starting a company which you're doing now, to being a VP product at a startup. But before that, being in a corporate like Cisco and that whole transition. But even before that, drawing on your, what you say, your first entrepreneurial experience, so commanding one of the most prestigious computer courses in the Israeli Defense Forces, which I think it's an incredible take to look at it from an entrepreneurial perspective. So, I can't wait to hear about that. But before everything Ayal, we have to talk a little bit about Survivor. Because I'm a huge huge fan. It's been a dream since I'm like six years old to be on Survivor. Why do you love the show? I love the game. It's such a smart and fun game. And basically, you throw a bunch of people onto an island, I guess, it's not about these competitions that they do, it's about the social game and how you get people to follow you. And eventually, you're essentially you vote them out, you do all the things and eventually [--] them to vote for you and how you handle the social, it's just phenomenal. I think it's exactly, it's such an incredible game. Because like you're saying, a lot of people are enjoying the challenges and the drama, it's not about that. It's about this whole idea of how do you go through a journey and reaching the finals is not enough because then you have to have the jury. People that you blindsided and you voted out coming in. And I don't want to give any spoilers to people, but I'll give a small one. There is a player on the American series who I believe got to second place twice or three times over the 40 seasons. So, they brought this player back because he was so entertaining and he's very very intelligent. He runs, I believe, a fuel company in the US. But he only managed to get second place exactly for that reason. Because he missed out on that other whole aspect of the game. And so, we have much more to talk about. I'm actually now watching the 37th season and I'm loving it, but we'll have to catch up a little bit later about that. Ayal, take me back to your journey. Who are you way before you started a cybersecurity company here in the United States? Sure. So I guess very, very quickly, I started my journey in the Israeli intelligence forces. And basically I joined when I was in unit 8200, but I cannot say that in the podcast. And essentially I've been there for about six years. And I guess my last, the last thing I did there was running a course, as you said, it was one of the, it's the course that I probably wouldn't have got into as a teen as an 18 year old. But I was so lucky enough to be part of essentially, starting there I was very involved since the first one and got to be the commander of the first one. Oh wow, I didn't know that. Wow. Yeah. I was a teacher in the first and second one, and then I was commanding the fifth one. So, again, it was an amazing experience. And what's very unique about this specific, I don't think I'm gonna dive deeper into that, but what's unique is that it basically involves a lot of different units within the Israeli intelligence community. Which is extremely unique for any course, which again poses a bunch of unique challenges that you don't see in other courses in terms of, and again, I can't go in depth but there's so much of the politics behind it. Everybody wants to get the best people to come in, but they don't actually want to give the resources because there's this other unit needs to give the resources. Right. Now, Ayal, just for context, because a lot of people that are watching this from outside of Israel may not realize, but this specific course in general, the Army does a really great job at creating this filter. They're starting out that they're getting anybody who might be remotely interested in computer science going through a series of tests just as comprehensive, if not, more than the college applications to Stanford, MIT or Harvard. It's really remarkable the way that they're doing it. At the end, you reach a cohort of just a few dozen people out of thousands. And it's like this childhood dream. If before, people dreamt of being pilots and dreamt of being in the elite combat units, now, a lot of people are dreaming about getting to the course, specific one that you helped initiate and that you commanded its fifth iteration. And so, that's also why people that are in the course, they're so sought after and to all the other units, because these are some of the most brilliant minds. Talk to me a little bit about being 23, getting thrown into this responsibility of leading this course. And you're saying that this is your first entrepreneurial journey, right? Yes, exactly. Part of this was the fact that you have to, you're getting 23 years old, you're not extremely senior in terms of your rank, but then you have to deal with all these extremely senior people. The head of the steering committee for the course is the second in command in unit 8200. And you have to deal with all these people that are basically 10 levels higher than you are from all these different units. And again, and you need to make sure that, and one thing is they give you this you can do whatever you want, right? You can do, you can pretty much, obviously on the technical side, none of these people really have any idea what you're doing. You know way better than they are. But also just in terms of leadership you are thrown in this remote location that's not within one of the bases. And you can pretty much, you have all this freedom to get people ready and do what you need to do to get them ready for their service. But the other thing is the resources. It's getting the resources that you need, getting everything, pulling together the things that you need from all these different units. It was an amazing experience that it taught me a lot about how to handle large organizations; how to handle politics; how to work with people who are not, obviously, they'll report to you, but also they are much more senior than you. It was, and again, an amazing experience. I probably think some of the gray hair that I have now, it's probably due to that experience, but it was amazing. And the other one even more amazing thing is that I actually I met my wife. She was actually running the recruitment process for this course, and that's how we met. Oh, that's just beautiful. That's wonderful. But the course itself, it's not just another programming course. There's a lot of courses out there. It's not like taking a class at MIT and it's not like going to a summer program to learn how to code. This is a very intensive period, where you, as the commander over the course, don't just have the professional responsibility for the people going through it, but you're really responsible for their livelihoods over the course of a few months. They're relocated to another area and they look at you as the commander in charge. And like you're mentioning, at 23, you're given responsibility that a lot of people that are ten ranks above you, that's the responsibility that they've been working for for a long time. So, definitely, I totally appreciate what you're doing there. And I helped teach quite a bit in different courses, not the specific one, but it's a remarkable experience. Ayal, you transition to the United States, you do an MBA at Berkeley, you're at Cisco, and you're transitioning from there towards another startup. Talk to me a little bit about that transition, or if you even want to go before to another startup you worked at which was acquired by Cisco. Sure. So, basically, since after I left the military, I went to work for a bunch of start ups. And I was always, you have to, and again, now a start up when at Cisco, you interview a lot of people. And you see that some people are more of startup people and some people love the bigger companies. And some people like both. And there's no right and wrong there. It's your personality, what you like doing. And one of the things I always ask people is that want to join us is, "Why startup?" And part of it is just making sure that they understand what that is, and part of it to make sure it's a good fit. And I, again, maybe it was that experience. Maybe it was just [--]. I knew that startups was probably the right thing for me. I end up working for a few startups. Very early in my career I worked for a startup that got acquired by IBM. And that even reinforced my thinking that a big company is probably not for me. Even though, again, I think IBM was very, again, there's a lot of great things to say about IBM, but the culture wasn't a great fit for me at the time. And then I decided to come here to the US and basically get my MBA at Berkeley. And that was to me, a way to move to the Bay Area where everything happens. It was a really really great way to come in. Obviously, somebody that grew up in Israel and worked in Israeli, it was tech companies that most of the business in the US. But I didn't really have a strong US network. And this was just a great way to come to the Bay Area, build a network here. That was an amazing, amazing experience. And after doing that, I worked at a couple of startups here in the US. The second one I worked for was a company called OpenDNS, and about a year in we got acquired by Cisco. And again, I remember getting the email from the CEO saying Cisco is acquiring us. It was I think why I woke up very early that morning and [--], the email in my inbox and I remember thinking, it's going to be the IBM experience all over again. But it ended up being amazing. Cisco is very very good at acquiring companies. I think it's one of the companies that acquired the most companies went through the most M&A ever, and it was just a phenomenal experience. And it got me the view of what it's like to work in this very very large organization. And again, I can talk a lot about how well the merged that's  into the organization and how our CEO ended up becoming the head of SVP and GM for security at Cisco. What is one thing that you experience which was very positive in the mergers and acquisitions? because a lot of the people that I talked to on the show, they've gone through these different mergers and acquisitions, it sounds like the majority of them aren't as successful as people hope them to be, right? And obviously, it's extremely difficult and complicated process, not just technologically and professionally, but also in terms of the culture. Because you're going from a small startup, even a hundred people is tiny compared to thousands of people at a large organization when all of a sudden you have a new identity. So, what was one thing that you found really helpful in your transition? The one thing I think Cisco did very very well, and I think IBM that's where they missed, Cisco basically gave us the autonomy and they didn't come in and told us, "This is what you need to do." "You need to change everything to be Cisco." And again, eventually it happened over a number of years. But they came in and nothing changed in the beginning. We still had our the same reporting structure, we still had the autonomy that we had. There were a lot of things, I'm sure very difficult for Cisco to agree to because they were very different than how they do things. I'm sorry. But they didn't really change any of that. They allowed us to continue doing everything as we did. And to some extent that their approach was, "You guys have built something very very successful." "You guys are doing something amazing." "We want to come in and learn from you." And they changed a lot of their, what I did there was I was running the product management organization for Umbrella, which was the leading product that we had. And they were basically saying, "We want to learn from you." "How do you guide from product?" And I ended up getting a bunch of other product groups reporting into me from Cisco. This I-can't-say group ended up reporting into my organization. They basically said, "You guys know how to do this?" "Because you are a very very successful company." Which, again, was I think, was a very very smart way of doing things. Right. So then, you're transitioning from Cisco. And I'd love to make sure we have enough time to also talk about the current startup that you're running. Because now you've transitioned after being at a few startups, being at a few corporate, being a commander in the IDF, you're now starting your own company. So, tell me a little bit about Anjuna Security and some of the insights that you've gained throughout the process of starting this company. Sure. So, I guess due to a lot of what I did throughout my career was getting ready for this. I always knew I wanted to start my own company. And a lot of what I did was geared to that. Even in my MBA, I did my internship at a VC firm just to see the other side of the table looks like and learn from that. So, after Cisco, I went to a VP Product series A startup at the time, series B startup now. I have to see what it's like to be an executive at a startup and get that experience as well. Very cool. And then my time there was cut short because a friend of mine that I knew from the Israeli intelligence days, he was actually a teacher at the course I was a commander of, he reached out to me and he just finished his PhD at Stanford working with Professor Dan Boneh that you might know. Of course. So, he basically researched this, it's funny, it was this huge huge security problem that we both knew about in the Israeli military intelligence and to say it in one sentence is that, you can't secure data and use it at the same time. Every time data is being used, it's essentially not, it's not being secured because it has to be in the clearing memory. And I ran into that problem again and again throughout going in the private sector as well as at Cisco, in a lot of places I ran into how big that problem was. And he actually found a solution for that problem during his PhD with Dan Boneh. So, we ended up joining forces and starting a company to actually solve this problem. Wow. So, you became a co-founder of this company, right? And you joined. So, what's actually happening now? Where is the company in the life cycle of a traditional startup? So, this was about two and a half years ago. The first thing we did was start talking to as many potential customers as it's possible to somewhat understand if we got the right problem. Once we had enough information, we basically built a deck and started pitching this to investors. We ended up getting both a seed round. So we raised our dollar seed as well as got into Y Combinator. Amazing. And when we did that at the time it was the same week that we got the term sheet for the investment and the call from YC. It was a good week. It was a good week. After a very difficult couple of months it was a very good week. And yes, since then, we grew the company. We raised a significant series A. And we're now basically a company of 20 people. Wow. That's incredible. Tell me a little bit about Y Combinator, because that's something that almost every startup seize as the glory of programs to go through to accelerate your growth. What was that experience like going through it? Yeah. YC is amazing. It's basically a startup school. It's obviously it helped the company a lot, but what YC is very very good at is making sure you know what to focus on. That you focus on the right things and that you only focus on the right things. And they're just amazing at making you do that. So, it's obviously a great experience for the company. But it's also an amazing school for me as an entrepreneur. Just to doing it is very very different than seeing it from the sidelines. And again, I've seen it from the, I was part of it as an exec, I was part of it as an employee, I was looking at it from the outside, I was doing the internship at a VC, but nothing helps you get actually ready and really understanding what you're going to go through as an entrepreneur. And the one thing that does the best is YC are really doing a really really great job. And the last thing that YC is doing is, and I think you probably heard this a lot, this is not becoming a cliche, but being an entrepreneur is an extremely lonely job. There's really no one that you can talk to. The again, the investors you have a great relationship you can talk to about a lot of things, but again, you need to be very thoughtful about what you tell them and how you tell them things. If you very existential, you don't really share things like that. And the same with your employees, right? You want to shield them with a lot of these ups and downs that you might be experiencing. And what's nice about what YC is that you get this cohort of other founders, that you can share all these things with that is extremely extremely helpful. Right. 100%. So, what was probably the most helpful event within YC? Was it the network that you were creating there? Was it the goal setting? I mean, I'm guessing that it was primarily the founding team that took part of it, right? Not necessarily the rest of the employees as actively. No. It was just me and my co-founder. And we started YC extremely early in the company's journey, again, as we were getting the term sheet for the seed, we got into YC the same week. And YC is essentially only for the founders. And it was me and my co-founder that went through this. In terms of what we got from it, one is, the YC network is phenomenal. If you're part of the YC network you can pretty much, it's like we email the founders of Airbnb and got a response back within minutes. It's just this amazing network of founders. It is just phenomenal. And also, YC continues, and again they helped us understand what we need to focus on, make sure we're focused on it. You work with two partners throughout the program and they help you reach the milestones that you need to reach. But also they continue to help you after you come out of YC. And you're still part of the network. You can still do office hours. You can still talk to people whenever you want. Plus they have these growth programs as well. They have something called the series A program that we actually didn't go through. We actually are lucky to be [--] for our series A. But they do help companies in raising their series A and getting ready to raise their series A. They also have a growth program that help companies once they reach about 50 people growing the company since then. So, YC keeps helping you throughout the lifecycle of the company. And obviously they've seen probably more startups than anyone else. So they can do a really good job at helping you there. And that's just phenomenal. Ayal, best of luck with the startup. It sounds incredible. And I just love this journey that you went on. And you really got to taste so many different parts of the tech ecosystem. And the fact that you're saying that a lot of these experiences were geared towards preparing you for this incredible journey that you're on now, I think that's just really awesome way of looking at it. And the way that you are talking about your experience as the commander of that course in the IDF, I think it totally resonates. And I think it's part of the magic of startup nation, part of the magic that also Eric Schmidt talks about a lot. And the book, obviously, Startup Nation talks about that it's this innovation through necessity. And when you think about commanding a course in the IDF, you don't necessarily think about, you think about the professional side of it and the mentorship, but you're presenting this whole other side of you had to innovate your network, to innovate politics in order to make sure that this works. Ayal, before we leave, I want to thank you for being so generous of your time. What are three words that you would use to describe yourself? Sure. So, well, you gave me a minute before we started to think, so yeah. I think that the three words I would use are, one is passionate. Number two is curious. And I really believe in the student always mentality. I think you can always get better. You can always learn more. And I love learning new things. And the last one is empathetic. Why is that? Explain that a little bit more. I think one of the best things, especially CEO regardless if he is a manager, but definitely as an entrepreneur, the one important thing you build is not actually the product, it's the company. And a huge piece of building a company is the culture that you build. And one of the things I'm focusing on the most is how do I build the right culture. How do I build a culture that I would want to be a part of. And again, working for a lot of startups I've seen better cultures and worst cultures. And it got me thinking a lot about what culture I want to build. And I want to have a place where people enjoy being a part of it. And to me it's all about, I think, I actually have a little story, which I think is he best way to think about this. I was lucky to meet Eric Yuan, the founder of Zoom on a couple of occasions and small group settings. And he talks about the culture that he's building. And he see all these companies with the company values, the seven things they put on the wall and it's like super, I think nobody nobody reads it, nobody remembers it. He said, and we adopted it that are in Anjuna as well, he said the one company value that they have, is care. He said it's caring about the employees, caring about the customers, caring about your investors. So, it's the one thing. And every time I go back decision to make, I go back to that and thinking about that. And I think that's an extremely important piece of building a company. Wonderful. Ayal, thank you very much. Toda raba. This was just that wonderful. Best of luck. Thank you. Best of luck to you. Bye bye.
