1 For farmers to really be successful and to really build with thought and build something which will last a long time, my view is that farmers should take the time, get to a decision what they want to build, begin building it, really get down the line of understanding, really have it well documented of what they want to build, how they want to build it. Avi Eyal, thank you for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Welcome. Thank you very much for having me. I am honored to have you here. Such a pleasure. Avi, I can't wait to talk to you about your journey all the way from South Africa with startups all the way to venture capital. I'm blown away by even just saying this, entrée Capital with over 90 portfolio companies. 23 exits, you told me. But that's putting aside the eight fantastic ventures that you've either exited or been successful with yourself. Avi, what gives? How do you even go to having such an incredible trajectory? I have to get into the mindset of what you went through in your life. It's just incredible. So, as a background, and it's not such a great trajectory, I think many people have much greater. But I was born in Israel to a very average Israeli family. My father was in the colonel in the Air Force, I used to see him once a week. And at some stage, my mother had enough of it. And at the age of six, my father took up the role as an engineer in South Africa and moved us to South Africa. And I grew up in South Africa. In grade one, I met what became a great friend and also a business partner of mine, Martin, and I did my schooling in South Africa. Studied engineering at the University of Natal. Studied computer engineering and software engineering, electrical engineering. And to put myself through university, I really didn't know what I was doing. So, I started a company writing software to people. It was the age of ARCNET and Ethernet starting up and, and people were writing database's in dBase and [--] seven. And I started writing software for companies and someone asked me, "What do you need to give me an invoice? What are you going to call this company of yours?" So, I didn't have anything better to do in an age of 18. I called the great programming solutions GPX, and that's how the company started. We became known as Insight Technologies. By the time I finished university, we had 50 or 60 employees. Two years later, we merged into an IPO in South Africa and then in London. And really from not knowing any better, we had a fairly good success in this business. I eventually left the business and had another two startups that I wanted to try out. One we sold to Walmart subsidiary in South Africa, and the second became a pretty big property business, which ended I up being a shareholder of for 15 years. But what I realized was that I needed to leave South Africa if I wanted to make it big, you know. Like the actors go to Hollywood to try and make a big world. You know, entrepreneurs want to make a big, we go to the US. It seems that a couple of other people were doing the same kind of thing. Probably much more successful than me, Elon Musk, Roelof Botha at Sequoia, seems like they had the same idea. So, I landed in the US and I was fortunate enough to, over the next six years, be involved in a number of startups which were sold eventually to two public companies. One to private equity business, and one I sold back to management, where I learnt a valuable lesson that if things don't look right and don't feel right, and it's much better to exit gracefully. Get your money back and move on. And then from there, I went through a couple of phases. I went back to South Africa, got married, started one more startup, exited it to a public company in India and my partner, Martin and I, who were involved in the startup as well, we decided that we'd start investing in companies. We had reached the ripe old age of 40 and everyone was younger, brighter, faster, stronger. So, we thought that, you know, we have a bit of experience and you know, if we can leverage our founder experience to other industries, other startups, we could leverage that. And that was the birth of Entrée Capital. Wow. Avi, I have to focus a little bit about this incredible entrepreneurial experience. Walk me through some of these of the key similarities between the different ventures that you formed. I think one of the most fascinating things that I'm gaining from hearing these incredible stories is really piecing together some insights when you look back. So, if you look back, for example, in the first venture that you had during college, what are some key either mistakes or incredible insights that you have gained looking back at it that you took with you throughout the rest of your journey? Sure. Which mistakes didn't I make? I kind of think that we were lucky and successful despite everything we did. I love it. The one thing is we got involved, I always started in businesses that were moonshots or at the forefront of what they were doing. So, we kind of picked the trend of, you know, applications, databases on PCs, moved to Windows from the old Novell environment, you know, when networking became far more accessible and easier to manage. So, we leveraged those things and that was kind of a trend that followed on when, my second venture in South Africa was ICOM, which did which basically took EDI, which was really old and really erected an XML and created XML schemes. This is a 1995 or so. Again, what's at the forefront of what was happening in those days and sending those messages across pharmaceutical companies and big distributors over the Internet to, in the states where we had a business, one of the businesses was called Maestro Commerce, where it was really Shopify in 1999. But you'll appreciate that there wasn't, there wasn't the ability to build things at scale in the cloud, in that first Internet 1.0 operation. But having said that, we did very well with it to [--] DNS which I was involved in a company that was taking DNS and putting it in a software stack for the first time and taking it off routers, Cisco routers and things like that. Fast forward 15 years later, I back to business school NS1 out of New York, which is kind of the new generation of DNS. And NS1 today is probably the leading company around the world for application load balancing, content distribution, DNS, security and things like that. And so, a lot of the things repeat on themselves in new guises. Mistakes we made there kind of not understanding how to hire the right people, and not understanding how to scale business, being very much probably a fair amount of arrogance and kind of building things around yourself rather than building things around teams and releasing. You know, typical mistakes that people make when they don't have the benefit of expertise in an ecosystem to use. And it was one of the biggest valuable lessons I learned moving to the states, and that in South Africa, you were working as an island, you know. There wasn't an ecosystem to teach you how to build great tech companies. And that's the one thing that you have to give to Israel, to London now, to Boston, New York, San Francisco. These places have developed unbelievable ecosystems that, and certainly in the second iteration post 2008, of information sharing and families helping each other. Jus the plethora of information that's out there, whether it's a blog post, you know, 20 Minute Leadership, etc., for people to share information and not worry about sharing the information in a way that it lifts up the entire industry and makes everyone successful. 100%. Avi, so, obviously now, aside from the eight ventures that you've had, which are incredible, you've now also invested in over 90 portfolio companies. You've seen a, you know over a quarter of them exit already. I have to gauge now, for young entrepreneurs, as an entrepreneur myself and for other young entrepreneurs starting on their journey, what are some, you mentioned about the power of the ecosystem and power of the expertise. So, here's an opportunity for me to talk to one of the world experts on startup formation and venture and venture scaling. What are some key things that I should keep in mind as I go about my venture or my friends who keep in mind as they go about theirs from the early days, all the way to hiring properly and scaling it a little bit? I know it's an incredible amount to cover, but the key nuggets or the key things that you just keep repeating themselves. Yes. So, I'm not really an expert. It's, you know, I offer advice, and sometimes the advice is right. but I keep telling people that past performance is no indicator of future returns. I think that too many founders have, especially in this last year or two, too many founders leverage their own brand to go out and raise incredible amounts of money because it's easy. And my thought on it is that for founders to really be successful and to really build with thought and build something which will last a long time. My view is that founders should take their time, get to a decision what they want to build, begin building it, really get down the line of understanding, really have a well documented on what they want to build, how they want to build it. Make decisions on how they're going to scale, what those things are going to look before they raise them copious amounts of money. I think they should raise their pre-seed or their seed around, they should take time. They should make sure they have it right. Because if you do things right and if you get to this breakout situation or moonshots trajectory, you don't have time to go back and do things all over. You don't have time to go back and correct the sins of the past. So, my intention is not to be so influenced by, oh, I can now raise the seed round. Six months later, I can raise the A, and you know, triple the valuation or quadruple the valuation. If someone wants to give me 20 million now, let's quickly take that. I think it has to be a bit of thought put into it. Just because money is there, money is not the objective. The objective is how to build a big company, a successful venture that is meaningful to you and to your stakeholders. And many times the funding is the, it is someone else's solution. It's not the company's best interest. So, my view is to take it slow, repeat, build the flywheel, test, retest and then grow. And I think that it's a hard thing to hold yourself back in this market where money is so cheap. But I think long term is best served if you do that. I think that one of the things in your touching upon which I've been very curious about myself and I've been hearing a lot here, is this idea of intentionality. Not just being intentional about, you know, your team and your product, but also being intentional about the growth of your company and having some sort of coherent rationality behind the decisions you make. And like you're mentioning, you know, I'm seeing an environment in which there is a lot of interest from investors, there's a lot of interest from advisors and from people to want to be part of different journeys, especially in communities like, let's say 8200 or Stanford, but with so many other communities as well. And what I'm watching also is almost like you mentioned, a lack of intentionality and a fight for raising the most amount of capital or for the biggest names and the biggest brands. But without thinking, perhaps, too critically about how is this going to help me reach my next milestone of making that moonshot impact or some meaningful impact along the way. And so, I'm definitely taking that to heart. But Avi, I have to ask, perhaps, one of the most difficult questions. You've done so much. You've had eight incredible ventures. You have 90 portfolio companies with 23 exits. You've run SigmaLabs, you are on the board member of Monday.com from the beginning with so many other companies, why work more? Why do you get up still every day and work so much to continue finding more amazing companies and spend more time? You've done it all. Like, seriously. So, I would beg to differ. My passion is growing businesses, growing founders and I live and breathe it. I think a lot of people have done far better. And it's not a race, not a comparison. But if someone built nine businesses themselves, you know, if you take, if you had to compare on Elon Musk, he's done, you know, two or three businesses, got SpaceX, he's got Tesla, and he's got a few other things. But just between those two things, he's done so much more than I could ever hope to do. But I suppose in my own way, I love founders, I love building. I enjoy the challenge. I need to be challenged every day. And for me, it's a combination of I keep telling my founders, ABC. Always be closing, you know. The challenge that could you be missing out on something. You know, maybe a bit of avariciousness, but it's kind of the need to learn every day. I'm insatiably thirsty for information and data and learning. And also, to be fair, it's not that I've built 90 or, the founders have built 90 businesses. I have partners and employees who work with me and the partnership has built 90 successes. I maybe the front face of the partnership but everyone in our business works really hard and really does extraordinarily well. And maybe I think maybe the success has been that insatiability or that appetite to build and not to miss out to and to help and to grow, I think has maybe rubbed it off on the three or four key people in our business that write the checks. Right. I have to say that even beyond the incredible trajectory, I'm even more inspired by the humbleness that you portray here. And obviously, there are phenomenal people that are working on a lot of these endeavors. But at the end of the day, you mentioned that you didn't create those 90 companies yourself, but, you know, finding those 90 companies and then finding the right founders and having that joint partnership and providing value that both sides are happy, i think that's inspiring for me to say. I see so many partnerships of friends, either from the venture capital world or founding partners or advisors that provide less value than anyone expected or even have deteriorating effect. And I think that finding the right partners, to me, it seems like you're growing as the biggest part here, in creating that venture. And I think that anybody who's been working with you is incredibly lucky. But Avi, a little bit about finding the right founders. Both founders and perhaps co-founders. So, you've seen now, you know, over 100 companies that you have personally been involved with, thousands more that you've observed. What are some interesting insights as to, either backing the right founders or for a founder, finding the right partners to go on the journey with? So, finding the right partners for us is has been a really challenging thing to do. I think that we come from a background where all of our partners are quite technical. They have very well-formed ideas of what they believe in. They, I would say about my partners is that they all have the highest morals and ethics. And to become a partner, we have to work with someone for a long time and we have to know them for a long time. And it's kind of that's always a challenge to get to the right place. From a founders and company perspective, we kind of created a formula of how we look at businesses and how we look at founders from a business perspective, we call it the four Ts where we created a formula which is timing, tick, TAM, and team. So, the founders individually are important, but the founders no good if they can't work on a team. Right. And so, when I look at you as a founder, I equally look at your co-founders. And my test is, if the founders, together, can work on a team. Right. We don't like compromising on people with that may not have absolute integrity or, you know, ethics or things like that. I think all too often people overlook certain challenges that founders have because they make it up by, the idea is great or something else. But my view is that you want to be in partners with the people you go into business with. And for us, we kind of set our founders that we are founders alongside them. You know, we are entrepreneurs, which is very different. And because as entrepreneurs, we can't see any of our businesses in any other way than from an entrepreneur's eyes. And so, we want to be an entrepreneur with you rather than a financial investor in you. Yes, we give you money and yes, we expect to have great returns. But we want to be on the journey with you. And so, we find that kind of that alignment works out very well. And I think we've become very quick at identifying if you are not fit. And so, we can say no quite quickly. But we also get to yes, very quickly. I love that. Avi, I have to thank you for being so generous with your time. And obviously, I know how incredibly busy you are and it's phenomenal having you here. Thank you for the inspiration and for the insights and for making a positive impact. I'm just looking at the different companies that either you've build or that you've helped become a founding partner, as you're saying. And I think it's just remarkable and just that impact on the world and that insatiable curiosity that you talk about is something that I identify with very closely, both with my family, but also with myself. And I think that I'm getting the most inspiration out of those two words from this conversation. But before we leave, I have to ask you the most important and difficult question, which is three words that you would use describe yourself. Is this in terms of business or in terms of personal? I'm going to let you decide that. Let's say if I ask one of your partners or one of the founders that you've backed, who is Avi Eyal, what are some words that they would say about you? Okay. Then I think they would tell you thoughtful, integrity and loyalty. I love that. And you forgot also the two most important words, insatiable, curious. But I think that I'm going to have [--] in that. [--] Avi, toda raba. Thank you very, very much. And I look forward to keeping in touch. And it's just incredible. Thank you. Thank you. I really appreciate you having me on the show.
