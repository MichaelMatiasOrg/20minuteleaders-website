1
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,680
All right.

2
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,320
Laura Lauder, thank you so much

3
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,120
for being on my show.

4
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,520
How are you?

5
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,320
Thank you, Michael.

6
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,720
It's a pleasure to be here.

7
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,640
I am incredibly excited for this

8
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,520
because I've heard so much about you.

9
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,240
I've worked with you through J-Ventures.

10
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,920
I've seen you

11
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,440
being the chair of J-Ventures,

12
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,760
and reading about all the different

13
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,320
incredible things that you've done.

14
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,640
It's inspiring.

15
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,600
And the impact

16
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,440
that you're having hands-on

17
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,120
is just remarkable.

18
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,120
And I would love to spend these 20 minutes

19
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,440
to talk about your journey.

20
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,880
I want to talk about philanthropy.

21
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,720
I want to talk about

22
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,760
philanthropic venture capital.

23
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,720
I want to talk about your work

24
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,080
with J-Ventures, and the different

25
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,480
Jewish organizations here

26
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,120
and what that means to you.

27
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,640
But first of all, Laura,

28
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
right before we started this,

29
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,680
you mentioned sports.

30
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,040
That sports got you

31
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,280
into this competitive nature,

32
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,840
which is very evident also

33
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,000
in the space that you're in today.

34
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,760
So, talk to me a little bit

35
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,240
about this passion for sports

36
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,120
and how you get started.

37
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,480
Great. Okay, Michael.

38
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,760
Thanks so much for doing this.

39
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,080
I think these podcasts

40
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,200
are just so relevant.

41
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,080
It gives folks an insight into how people

42
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,200
got to the place that they are.

43
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,000
I mean, I'm pushing 60 here.

44
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,520
And even though you can't tell

45
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,440
by my hair color,

46
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,000
I love the fact that

47
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,080
I used to be a young person

48
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,440
and always looked up to folks

49
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,720
who've done much more.

50
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,880
And so, it's wonderful

51
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,440
that you're doing this.

52
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,200
Thank you very much.

53
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,360
I appreciate it.

54
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,040
So, in terms of how I grew up,

55
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,960
the reality is that I grew up

56
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,480
in a small town in Ohio, Midwest.

57
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
My father was involved

58
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,360
in international business.

59
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,520
And so, he was gone a lot at the time.

60
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,080
But he used to

61
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,640
bring me back wonderful toys

62
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,160
and wonderful cultural gifts

63
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,920
from his travels.

64
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,000
And one of the things that he was also

65
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,280
very passionate about, was tennis.

66
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,920
And so, as a child growing up,

67
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,520
I was always very very enthusiastic

68
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,960
about beating Dad in order to show him

69
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,480
that he had a great kid to come home to

70
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,880
whenever he came back from these travels.

71
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,600
And as a result,

72
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,160
I became a competitive tennis player.

73
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,320
I'll never forget when I was 16,

74
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,200
I actually challenged my dad

75
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,080
to a big match.

76
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,400
He had been playing all his life.

77
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,880
And I was very very passionate

78
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,560
about tennis.

79
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,040
And I challenge him to have a big match.

80
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,000
And what was going to be the reward?

81
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,680
A new used car for me

82
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,840
so I could drive myself

83
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,000
to tennis tournaments.

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And that imbued a whole passion

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,040
for being competitive.

86
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,840
And then, once I won that car from him,

87
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,120
because I definitely beat him,

88
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,400
you could probably have guessed that,

89
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,480
I ended up playing college tennis.

90
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,840
And college tennis

91
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,280
was a very different experience.

92
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,480
Because I was so much focused

93
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,400
on individual competitions.

94
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,520
But now, playing as a team

95
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,440
that collaborative spirit,

96
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,040
and yet we were as a team,

97
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,800
competitive against other schools,

98
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,320
that made me a much better,

99
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,000
let's just say, partner and teammate

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,080
in the greater world.

101
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,400
So, sports has always provided a way

102
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,440
for me not only to stay healthy and fit,

103
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,160
and hopefully not look too much

104
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,120
like I'm pushing 60,

105
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,600
but definitely a way of life

106
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,040
and a way to collaborate with others

107
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,720
in this competitive world.

108
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,320
I love it.

109
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,320
So, what is it about

110
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,200
this competitive nature

111
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
in this collaborative world?

112
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,800
Because I took part in First Robotics,

113
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,920
a robotics competition back in Israel,

114
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,880
but also in the US.

115
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,360
And one of the wonderful things

116
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,720
that Dean Kamen,

117
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,400
the founder of it says, is Coopetition.

118
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,360
Cooperation and competition.

119
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,360
Which resonates a lot

120
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,200
to what you're saying here

121
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,040
about your experience with tennis

122
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,600
and now into this other world.

123
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,200
What is it about this coopetition

124
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,560
that you find useful

125
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,720
in your journey today?

126
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,160
So, Michael, one of the things

127
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,680
that I found is that,

128
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,080
as a philanthropist,

129
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,400
when I married Gary Lauder

130
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,760
and I realized I was moving

131
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,520
into a new world of philanthropy.

132
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,760
I'd always been passionate

133
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,440
about philanthropy.

134
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,280
But I had a career in tech.

135
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,600
And I was a salesperson

136
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,640
for an IBM mainframe software company,

137
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,040
370 Architecture.

138
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,400
Wow.

139
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,560
COBOL code generators

140
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,320
and that whole world in the 80s.

141
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,680
Once I moved out of that

142
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,240
and married Gary when I was 30,

143
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
I've realized that I had to step up

144
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,600
my game in the philanthropy world

145
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,560
because that was going to be

146
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,800
my new future.

147
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,360
Gary and I like to joke

148
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,280
that he, now as a venture capitalist,

149
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,120
likes to make money

150
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,760
and I try to give it away, and I'm faster.

151
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,120
So, what I try to do,

152
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,760
is try to use our philanthropy

153
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,640
to fill gaps where there's no one else

154
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,120
perhaps focused in this area,

155
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,680
and our added value

156
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,320
is going to really make the difference.

157
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,200
It's going to bridge

158
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,680
where people are today,

159
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,480
to what a future could look like.

160
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,680
Now, in order to do that,

161
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,320
that's a highly competitive space

162
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,520
because you have to collaborate

163
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,120
with the people on one hand

164
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,080
and then hand off to the other hand.

165
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,640
So, for example, here's an example.

166
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,520
Our children were going

167
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,560
to a Jewish day school.

168
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,560
And at that Jewish day school,

169
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,920
they had the most wonderful teachers.

170
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,400
The Gideon Houseman Jewish Day School

171
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,360
in Palo Alto, California.

172
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,360
But what I realized is that

173
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,920
these kinds of teachers weren't there.

174
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,240
You didn't see fantastic teachers

175
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,160
like these in all schools.

176
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,240
So, I said, we've got to find a way

177
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,160
to build a pipeline of Jewish teachers

178
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,120
who are passionate about teaching

179
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,080
and passionate about tikkun olam,

180
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,360
and passionate about

181
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,920
integrating Jewish values

182
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,280
into the curriculum.

183
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,280
So, there was this big gap of a pipeline

184
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,640
of Jewish day school teachers.

185
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,800
So, I created this program called DeLeT.

186
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,880
Which, as you know, is Hebrew for door.

187
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,120
It was opening the door

188
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,720
to a career in teaching.

189
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,480
And we have now trained

190
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,720
hundreds and hundreds

191
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,200
of Jewish day school teachers.

192
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,640
Like a Jewish Teach for America.

193
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,920
And that never existed before.

194
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,200
But we had to collaborate

195
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,160
with all of the schools

196
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,280
because they had to tell us

197
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,360
what the criteria were

198
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,600
for the best teachers.

199
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,400
We had to collaborate

200
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,240
with the universities

201
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,640
that were training teachers.

202
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,600
We had to collaborate

203
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,000
with any number of different organizations

204
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,880
that were feeder's into our program.

205
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,280
But we had to make ourselves the best

206
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,280
in terms of excellence and standards

207
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,000
so that we could scale this.

208
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,360
Because the two most important words

209
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,280
in philanthropy, are leverage and scale.

210
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,160
If you can lever other organizations

211
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,440
to feed your pipeline,

212
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,160
and you can scale it

213
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,760
so that has impact,

214
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,480
then, you've really done something well.

215
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,480
That is exactly what I'm curious about.

216
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,040
Because before, when you're saying

217
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,640
that spending money,

218
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,160
that doesn't do justice

219
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,760
to what you're doing.

220
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,680
You're using resources

221
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,240
to make a lasting impact on people.

222
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,040
And I'm really curious

223
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,280
about this latter part,

224
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,680
this lasting impact.

225
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,440
And how do you actually use resources

226
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,640
to go and transform institutions,

227
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,480
different industries

228
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,680
and different people's lives

229
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,120
so that they can pay it forward

230
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,320
and then transform

231
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,840
other people's lives?

232
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,800
So, how do you do that at scale?

233
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,600
Because sometimes, it seems that

234
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,640
a lot of the endeavors

235
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,360
that people do in philanthropy,

236
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,600
they're short lived,

237
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,640
or they are very specific to one segment.

238
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,840
How do you go about,

239
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,080
strategically thinking,

240
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,440
how do I take something like DeLet

241
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,600
and make it at scales

242
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,240
so that every one of those teachers

243
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,440
can influence another teacher

244
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,000
and dozens of students

245
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,640
who will then grow up

246
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,920
to be educators themselves

247
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,040
and mentors themselves?

248
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,640
Exactly.

249
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,800
Well, you've said it about DeLeT.

250
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,360
So, I'll give you another example.

251
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:49,560
Yes.

252
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,200
So, our kids, both that

253
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,960
we're thinking about doing a gap year,

254
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,760
both before college or after college.

255
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,400
And when we really thought about

256
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,400
what are the impacts

257
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,080
that young people can make,

258
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,960
a lot of folks say,

259
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,600
"Somebody 18 years old,

260
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,720
but really, what benefit

261
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,360
can they provide to the world in terms of

262
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,480
really doing something impactful?"

263
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,440
Well, when you talk about scale,

264
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,400
then you can think about

265
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,920
what Israel does, which is fantastic

266
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,360
in terms of enabling young people

267
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,080
to do a gap year

268
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,400
before they join the army.

269
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,761
And it's a service year.

270
00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:21,440
I did that at school, yeah.

271
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,400
Not a service year,

272
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
but I did a different gap year.

273
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,360
Right. So, in the United States,

274
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,240
we have something called AmeriCorps.

275
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,000
Only 80,000 young people

276
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,640
are eligible to do AmeriCorps

277
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,800
in terms of the funding

278
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
by the federal government

279
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,160
at $25,000 per kid.

280
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,520
There are 600,000 applicants.

281
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,720
So, a group of us

282
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,360
at the Aspen Institute worked with

283
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,840
four star General Stanley McChrystal,

284
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,080
who desperately wanted to create

285
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,760
a national program with huge scale

286
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,400
so that there are now

287
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,520
a million young people

288
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,240
serving in the military

289
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,160
in the United States.

290
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,280
He wanted to see a million young people

291
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,080
serving their country,

292
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,640
doing national service.

293
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,360
And right now, we're at 80,000.

294
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,720
But the demand is there.

295
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,520
So, how can we scale that up?

296
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,680
So, a group of us started

297
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,240
a wonderful new program

298
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,880
called the Service Year Alliance.

299
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
And we collaborated

300
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,280
with all kinds of non-profits

301
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,480
across the country.

302
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,200
And we're working to try to enable

303
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,160
every young person

304
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,600
who wants to do a service here

305
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,480
to be able to do that at age 18 to 26.

306
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,360
And just this week,

307
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,920
we have introduced legislation

308
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,320
into the United States Senate.

309
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,320
Co-sponsored by eight Democrats

310
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,580
and eight Republicans,

311
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,720
called the Corps Act.

312
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,280
C-O-R-P-S

313
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,800
And that piece of legislation

314
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,960
we're hoping to include

315
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,880
into that the Republicans version

316
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,640
of the Covid Relief Act,

317
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,680
and that would enable

318
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,560
250,000 young people

319
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,720
to do a year of national service.

320
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,520
So, scale is absolutely critical.

321
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
And at the end of the day,

322
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,960
public, private partnerships

323
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,760
are the best way to do that.

324
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,640
And what it sounds to me from that story,

325
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,120
it's not just about the resources,

326
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,160
it's about the relationships,

327
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,760
and it's about the strategic

328
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,160
entrepreneurial mindset of how do we get

329
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,520
from 80,000 to 250,000

330
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,880
with the collaboration

331
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,040
from different organizations

332
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,640
around the US showing that

333
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,200
there is a product market fit, right?

334
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,240
You have 600,000 applicants

335
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,160
who want to do this.

336
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,280
This is not just the dream

337
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,640
that you're selling somebody on,

338
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,120
this is a reality that is just

339
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,880
there's a bottleneck

340
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,200
that you have to turn the switch

341
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,840
and make it happen.

342
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,240
And there's a matching component.

343
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,880
So, it is very very much a tech platform.

344
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,200
So, if you go on to the service,

345
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,280
your alliance website,

346
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,760
serviceyear.org,

347
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,120
you'll see that you could put in criteria.

348
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,960
I want to teach fifth grade in New Orleans

349
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,040
starting in September of 2021,

350
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,720
and a list of opportunities will come up

351
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,440
and you can apply to them directly

352
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,600
through the website.

353
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,000
Making super easy for young people

354
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,720
to apply to these service positions

355
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,400
is really the key to making it successful.

356
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:48,840
Wonderful.

357
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,880
Laura, talk to me a little bit

358
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,440
about your Jewish identity

359
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,360
and why are you so excited

360
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,440
and passionate about this,

361
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,600
both your Jewish identity,

362
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,200
but also looking at it as a bit broader,

363
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,480
putting together the Israeli identity

364
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,560
and the Jewish identity

365
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,600
and the different groups

366
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,280
and what's happening here in the US

367
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:06,840
and the Bay Area.

368
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,800
Obviously, we're seeing the rise

369
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,520
of antisemitism around the world,

370
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,440
which is horrifying.

371
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,920
And I believe just last week

372
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,360
we had swastikas on Stanford campus.

373
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,520
So, it's all around us always.

374
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,320
And you're very very involved

375
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,640
with your Jewish identity

376
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,640
in the Jewish community.

377
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,360
So, I'd love to get a little bit

378
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,880
of inspiration into that.

379
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,880
Also, myself as an Israeli

380
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,840
and a Jewish citizen

381
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,920
here in the Bay Area,

382
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,880
with all my family back in Israel.

383
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,960
Great question, Michael.

384
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,400
In the United States,

385
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,320
you have to choose

386
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,240
to be Jewish today.

387
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,000
People can assimilate

388
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,160
and not be involved.

389
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,040
When you live in Israel,

390
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,800
and you grew up in Israel,

391
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,040
it's just part of life.

392
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,680
And it's part of your identity

393
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,040
that in ways that sometimes is negative

394
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,280
because there are so many ultra-Orthodox.

395
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,000
The Haredim destroyed

396
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,400
a lot of the culture of what is really

397
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,080
authentically Jewish, I think.

398
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,400
Right.

399
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,160
So, my sense of Judaism is this

400
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,040
positive, joyful values based identity

401
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,200
that I hope I got from my parents.

402
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,560
And I hope to be teaching now

403
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,920
to my children.

404
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,040
And what I would say to you

405
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,120
is that raising kids

406
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,400
is a very difficult thing to do.

407
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,560
And when you have a framework of values

408
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,480
that enable you to teach them

409
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,320
not only by the texts that are ancient,

410
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,160
but also, by the deeds,

411
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,520
the mitzvot that you do every day

412
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,200
so that kids learn by example.

413
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,760
That to me is the framework

414
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,320
of what Judaism provides

415
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,480
that is so valuable to me.

416
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,520
It's the history, the tradition,

417
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,200
the values, the culture,

418
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,000
the land, the language.

419
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,200
It's all of these things together.

420
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
And so, as a result of that,

421
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,240
I have gotten very involved in Jewish life

422
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,440
ever since I was very young.

423
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,120
So, I mentioned that

424
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,360
I was a tennis player.

425
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,320
My very first experience in Israel

426
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,880
was teaching at the Israel Tennis Center

427
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,000
in Ramat Hasharon.

428
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,480
I trained there.

429
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,640
No kidding.

430
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,040
Yeah. I'm a tennis player myself. Yes.

431
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,960
Wonderful. Yofi. Yofi.

432
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,560
Well, we loved playing tennis

433
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
at the Israel Tennis Center.

434
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,440
And then by the time

435
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,600
my kids were old enough,

436
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,720
our son was a big tennis player.

437
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,280
Our daughter played them, too.

438
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,360
That was one of the places

439
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,160
that we took them,

440
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,360
on our son's bar mitzvah trip.

441
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,040
So that they could play tennis

442
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,360
with Israeli teens

443
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,320
and folks who weren't just Jewish.

444
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,700
I mean, as you know,

445
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,080
there are Arab Israelis

446
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,560
who also play in the 13 or 14

447
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,360
different Israel tennis centers

448
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,320
around the country.

449
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,800
And the values associated

450
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,640
with teaching kids to play tennis,

451
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,520
learning the values of hard work

452
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,280
and discipline and practice.

453
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,120
And then also, the tutoring piece,

454
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,440
which, as you know, also happens

455
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,880
at the Israel Tennis Center.

456
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,840
And then countries around the world

457
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,000
came to Israel to say,

458
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,080
"How did you create

459
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,240
this wonderful tennis program

460
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,320
that enables kids to learn from each other

461
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,080
and also integrate

462
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,040
the communities together?"

463
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,440
Who cares if you're from an Arab community

464
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,520
or a Jewish community,

465
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,960
or, a Bedouin community?

466
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,160
Tennis is tennis.

467
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,960
And on the court,

468
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,720
everybody has to be a team player

469
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,840
and has to be a good competitor.

470
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,760
So, I just love the values

471
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,040
that Judaism has created

472
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,320
and it puts it to play

473
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,520
and to work in Israel.

474
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,560
I love it. I love it.

475
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,400
Laura, how do you manage your time?

476
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,080
You're doing so many different things.

477
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,120
Just preparing for this

478
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,200
and reading on all the different sources,

479
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,800
it's overwhelming the number of things

480
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,360
that you've done.

481
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,520
Very involved also with NPR

482
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,560
on their board.

483
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,200
How do you manage your time at the end?

484
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,200
Because you have so much to give, right?

485
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
You have so many different

486
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,320
passions and ideas.

487
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,280
And we were transitioning from sports

488
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,520
to AmeriCorps, to Judaism.

489
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,440
How do you balance your time

490
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,320
so that you can both provide impact

491
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,280
to these organizations who need your time,

492
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,120
because at the end,

493
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,240
the people are looking at you

494
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,000
as a leader, at the same time,

495
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,400
allowing yourself to branch out

496
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,080
and take risks on other endeavors

497
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,120
and continue to evolve and scale?

498
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,760
Well, first and foremost,

499
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,760
I have to give a lot of credit

500
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,000
to my sweet husband, Gary,

501
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,600
who just supports me

502
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,200
in every way possible.

503
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,200
So, and then secondarily,

504
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,760
to our two kids, Josh and Eliana,

505
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,760
who went to the

506
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,200
Gideon Houseman Jewish Day School,

507
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,960
have great values and are living

508
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,320
really positive impact lives right now.

509
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,840
And as a result of the fact

510
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,720
that I have really,

511
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,080
I'm very very fortunate

512
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,240
to have a healthy family,

513
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,320
both physically as well as emotionally,

514
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,800
they are a great support system.

515
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,960
We are a great support system

516
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,560
for each other.

517
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,080
So, that is the core.

518
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,880
And family values of our core family

519
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,480
is really critical.

520
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,680
The second thing I would say to you

521
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,000
is living a healthy lifestyle.

522
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,280
Like I am now a crazy maniac biker.

523
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,160
I love biking with a lot of Israelis

524
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,280
because they're very competitive.

525
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,440
And so, I bike a lot with Zach Renaud.

526
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,080
I don't know if you know that.

527
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,800
But Zach and I,

528
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,760
just actually biked for a week

529
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,440
here in Aspen, Colorado last week,

530
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,280
and he put me to shame.

531
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,080
So, I'm trying to keep up

532
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,640
with Zach and Orly.

533
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,400
But, I would also say to you

534
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,520
that managing your time

535
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,920
in terms of making sure

536
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,000
that you're focusing on your priorities,

537
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
that is the critical element.

538
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,760
I don't, frankly, I hate to say it,

539
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,640
I have not seen a television show

540
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,320
and I don't know how long.

541
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,400
We have dinners with friends outside

542
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,800
during this coronavirus pandemic,

543
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
almost every single night.

544
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,280
So, we're connecting with people.

545
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,720
We're hearing their ideas.

546
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,560
We're keeping this balance of life

547
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,240
with exercise, with friends,

548
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,120
with family, and, of course,

549
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,000
with our passions.

550
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,440
So, I'm on 11 boards.

551
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,800
And these boards are very time consuming.

552
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,880
My most recent board

553
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,720
is the National Constitution Center

554
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,520
in Philadelphia, which educates the world

555
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,280
about the American constitution.

556
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,120
Wanted a critical civics education today.

557
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,560
It's so important.

558
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,720
Especially today.

559
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,840
Especially today.

560
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,240
But I can't get involved

561
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,200
in any of these things,

562
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,400
unless I really have a balance in my life.

563
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,520
There's one other

564
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,760
really wonderful initiative

565
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,200
that I've just taken on.

566
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,880
And it's initiative

567
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,560
that Oded and I, have created.

568
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,200
It's called Shomrim

569
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,240
and which means, the Guardians.

570
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,920
And this is a ProPublica for Israel.

571
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,640
So, this is an opportunity

572
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,080
for us to provide

573
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,400
philanthropic journalism at its best.

574
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,480
Investigative journalism,

575
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,480
providing the best of news stories

576
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,080
to the existing media on social issues.

577
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,200
Not about politics,

578
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,320
not about the military,

579
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,600
not about the conflict.

580
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,920
It's about the social issues

581
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,640
that are applied today in Israel.

582
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,160
And I love Israel so much

583
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,960
that I want to make sure that Israel

584
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,680
is the best it can possibly be.

585
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,400
And I think investigative journalism

586
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,120
helps a country become as it can be.

587
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,240
So, among all of those things,

588
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,680
I can't pick one favorite.

589
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,600
It's just, it's all my baby.

590
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,400
It's the passion exudes from the screen.

591
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,120
And lastly, we have to talk

592
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,120
about J-Ventures,

593
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,000
that I've gotten involved with as well.

594
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,080
And I've been so inspired by Oded

595
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,960
and the team there,

596
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,600
and really the community

597
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,520
that is being built.

598
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,040
So, I've gotten to know,

599
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,600
especially through this show,

600
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,800
a lot of different VCs.

601
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,960
And I can very honestly, genuinely say,

602
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,400
I've never seen a community as strong

603
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,440
and as genuine as J ventures.

604
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,840
Especially going into due diligences

605
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,440
with 10 LPs who are each incredibly busy.

606
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,840
And working together.

607
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,400
because we enjoy working together,

608
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,760
checking the ego at the door

609
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,840
as [--]

610
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,200
said on the show.

611
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,360
He's also an LP there.

612
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,400
And you're chair of J-Ventures.

613
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,920
And one of the missions

614
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,360
is to connect to the the Jewish

615
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,840
and Israeli community together

616
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,440
and create magic there.

617
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,880
Now, we're both working

618
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,680
on the Next Generation project

619
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,720
for young Israelis and Jewish.

620
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,280
So, talk to me a little bit

621
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:54,960
about your involvement

622
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,600
with the J-Ventures

623
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,280
and why that fund?

624
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,400
And what are we trying to do there?

625
00:22:59,400 --> 00:22:59,800
Sure.

626
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,880
So, let me just correct you

627
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,680
one thing, Michael.

628
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,080
I'm not the chair of J-Ventures.

629
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,840
That's Oded and Jim Koshland.

630
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,800
What I'm the chair of

631
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,960
is this community outreach element.

632
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,640
So, the philanthropic piece of it.

633
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,920
So, as we begin to have exits

634
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,800
and we have some

635
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,400
philanthropic capital then

636
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,280
to put into play,

637
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,720
we now want to encourage

638
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,640
the next generation of J-Ventures

639
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,920
to participate in everything

640
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,520
that we're doing.

641
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,600
So, that's the objective there.

642
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,160
But the reason why I was involved

643
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,520
with Oded at the very beginning,

644
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,920
to help him create J-Ventures,

645
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,680
was really to bring our passions together

646
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,000
into one community.

647
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,300
To integrate folks,

648
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,880
to give them opportunities to meet others.

649
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,560
Can you imagine there are many

650
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,240
American Jews who don't know Israelis

651
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,080
in an intimate way.

652
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,920
To know what are the issues

653
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,880
that they have faced

654
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,680
as young people growing up in Israel

655
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,400
or young people growing up here

656
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,000
with an Israeli identity.

657
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,880
So, we share the Zionism passion.

658
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,000
But we also share

659
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,120
this legacy of Judaism

660
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,440
and of those values

661
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,360
that I dare say,

662
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,920
some Israelis don't value

663
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,040
as much as American Jews do.

664
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,240
And so, seeing the passion

665
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,080
for tikkun olam of American Jews

666
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,360
and the passion for community

667
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,760
based on Judaism,

668
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,440
that's a rare thing for some Israelis.

669
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,880
And so, to bring these

670
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,080
two communities together

671
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,880
to share their common purpose

672
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,720
and passions,

673
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,120
I think it's a really worthwhile endeavor.

674
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,560
I love it.

675
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,000
Laura, for myself

676
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,200
and for other young entrepreneurs

677
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,080
and engineers going through their journey,

678
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,280
what should we keep in mind

679
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,960
as we go along for our futures,

680
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,440
whether it would be in tech,

681
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,760
or education, or whatever it may be,

682
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,280
what are some core values

683
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,440
that you now, looking back,

684
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,840
see are a foundation for who you are

685
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,440
that we should take with us as well?

686
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,480
I think one of the most important elements

687
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,600
for all of us is balance.

688
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,560
It's this question that we talked about

689
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,560
a few minutes ago, Michael, where

690
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:07,080
we have to have a life

691
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,960
that is not so stressful

692
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,440
that we are constantly battling

693
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,320
our inner demons

694
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,640
about what is the right thing to do,

695
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,280
what's the best thing for us to do.

696
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,040
There's no one right answer.

697
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,920
And so, to have whether

698
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,640
it's mindfulness and meditation,

699
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,760
or hardcore exercise out on a bike

700
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,200
for a couple of hours,

701
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,960
or a way for you to just make sure

702
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,920
that you stay in touch with who you are

703
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,880
and what's important to you,

704
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,240
that, to me, is a key element

705
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
of any successful person.

706
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,160
And I have to say that

707
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,480
as a young entrepreneur going through,

708
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,600
and especially here in the Bay Area,

709
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,720
the lines get blurred

710
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,560
and it's very easy to all of a sudden

711
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,840
find yourself working in those

712
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,160
17, 18 hour days on various projects

713
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,160
and without even having the time

714
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,600
before going to bed to sit down,

715
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,840
reflect on what's important

716
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,160
and what are the priorities.

717
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,400
And that's definitely something

718
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,880
that I'm taking to heart as well.

719
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,360
So, thank you for the inspiration.

720
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,440
Laura, before we go,

721
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,120
I want to thank you for your generosity

722
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,400
and for everything that you're doing,

723
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,520
but also for your generosity

724
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,320
with your time here for this show.

725
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,520
I really appreciate it.

726
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,680
And I would like to ask for three words

727
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,320
that you would use to describe yourself,

728
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,520
or that Gary would use to describe you,

729
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,400
or anybody else that's worked with you.

730
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,520
Okay. So, I think I will say,

731
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,920
And I did not prepare you for this.

732
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,920
So, I'm not holding those three words.

733
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,280
I didn't give enough time ahead.

734
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,800
I guess, I care a lot.

735
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,440
So, I'm caring.

736
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,622
I'm highly energetic.

737
00:26:32,622 --> 00:26:34,200
Yeah.

738
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,440
And I'm passionate, as you can tell.

739
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,640
Of course. I love it.

740
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,200
Laura, thank you very much. Toda raba.

741
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,720
I look forward to continue watching

742
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,400
the amazing things that you're doing.

743
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,210
And thank you for all the inspiration.

744
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:49,440
Bye.
