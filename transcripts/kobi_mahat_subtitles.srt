1
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,880
All right. Kobi Mahat
Thank you so much for joining

2
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,800
on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,800
I’m really happy to be here

4
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,500
Okay, this is so great. 
You know, I actually grew up

5
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,800
watching you on TV. 
I grew up in Tel-Aviv

6
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,300
watching the children’s channel 
and HaShminiya and HaPijamot and…

7
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,700
and all the different shows 
that you got to be a part of.

8
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,700
And we actually even --

9
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,700
I've actually got to study 
under your command

10
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,700
in a program where you taught us

11
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,700
how to act in front 
of the camera.

12
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,700
So, it’s nice to close this loop 
after all these years.

13
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,700
I actually taught you, 
I think, how to host, not to act.

14
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,700
And there’s a big difference 
if you can remember

15
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,700
from acting and hosting.

16
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,700
It’s completely 
different profession.

17
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,700
So, it sounds like I already 
failed my first test

18
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,700
after all these years.

19
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,700
No scores here.

20
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,700
No scores here. That’s amazing. 
So, Kobi, a tank commander

21
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,700
in the army, going out to study 
psychology and organizational

22
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,700
behavior in your masters,

23
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,300
and all of a sudden, 
you find yourself

24
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,700
as one of the biggest stars 
in Israel on a children’s show.

25
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,700
You’re practically an idol 
for every kid

26
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,700
growing up in Israel.

27
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,700
I have to understand how this 
whole sequence came about.

28
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,700
Well, it was virtually a mistake.

29
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,700
It wasn’t meant to be.

30
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,700
I was going to be --

31
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,700
my root since I was, 
I think, 15 was a --

32
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,700
I wanted to be a psychologist 
ever since my mother took me

33
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,700
to the book fair and bought me 
“The Origins of Dreams”

34
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,700
of Sigmund Freud.

35
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,700
I don’t know if that’s the name 
of the book anyways.

36
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:53,300
Those two books sort paved the way 
for me to be a psychologist.

37
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,700
That’s what I thought 
I wanted to be.

38
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,700
That’s what I started studying 
after I was done with the army.

39
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,700
I think three months after 
I was done with the army,

40
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,700
I already joined 
the Tel-Aviv University

41
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,700
and started studying.

42
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,700
And what happened is 
between the first and the second

43
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:18,500
degree, a friend of mine just 
thought that we had

44
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,300
the same sense of humor.

45
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,700
That was very nice of him to think

46
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,700
we had a sense of humor 
to begin with.

47
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:29,500
Anyways, we wrote something 
very naïve and he sent it

48
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,700
to all kinds of broadcasters.

49
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,100
One of them, 
a very famous  one in Israel,

50
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,700
a major broadcaster 
in Israel, Keshet,

51
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,700
decided that it was pretty good.

52
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,300
They were not going to produce it,

53
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:48,300
but they’re looking 
for new writers for a TV show.

54
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,700
And we became writers

55
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,700
- right in the beginning... 
- [unclear] off in writing.

56
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,700
in a primetime TV.

57
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,300
And ever since, 
I just started writing.

58
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,300
Until today, 
I’m writing for a lot of adults

59
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,700
and kids' shows. 
And went to the children’s channel

60
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,700
just to write and they told me 
that I should host.

61
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,700
I didn’t know I was able to host.

62
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,700
- Wow! Okay. So, you’re writing –
- And I was

63
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,700
willing to jump to the really 
deep end of the water.

64
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,000
And how quick 
was this transition?

65
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,700
So, you go there to write. 
And all of a sudden,

66
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,700
you find yourself a host.

67
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,700
How quickly does it go 
from 0 to 60, and --

68
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,700
- It was pretty quick.
- you're an icon?

69
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,700
It was pretty quick. 
It was 2000.

70
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,700
And in 2000, there was only one 
children’s channel in Israel.

71
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:43,000
So, if you were one of the hosts, 
you were a mega hit with the kids

72
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,300
and their parents, immediately.

73
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,700
And in 2000, it was pretty quick

74
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:53,700
becoming a huge success 
from 0 to 100 in...

75
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,900
- Insane.
- no time.

76
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,300
Insane. 
So, Kobi, try to summarize

77
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,700
this whole experience for me. 
You go on daily on this children’s

78
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,700
channel and you are an icon.

79
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,700
And you are a role model.

80
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,700
How old are you at that point 
when you're a --?

81
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:11,700
I was 27. I was pretty old for 
a TV -- children’s TV presenter.

82
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,700
I was 27. 
I always had sort of a baby face.

83
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:21,700
So, nobody really knew, 
but I was pretty old. 27, it’s --

84
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,700
But Kobi, that’s a lot 
of responsibility.

85
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,700
Like, you’re taking on this 
innate responsibility.

86
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,700
You’re not just a host. 
You’re a role model

87
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,700
for kids growing up.

88
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,700
In everything you do----
when you walk down the street

89
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,700
and things you see on TV, 
on and off camera,

90
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,700
do you feel that responsibility? 
Or is it like --?

91
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,700
You know what? 
I think everybody was

92
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,700
over-exaggerating 
the role model thing.

93
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:49,700
I think the guidelines I had, 
and I always told other hosts

94
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,700
that came after me 
was just pure common sense.

95
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,700
If I was standing in the street 
and I wanted to cross the road,

96
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,700
I would go and wait 
for the green light.

97
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,700
Maybe as an adult, 
sometimes, I could --

98
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,700
I could --

99
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,700
you could cut some corners 
and cross on the red light.

100
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,700
But I took it upon myself 
to understand that some kids

101
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,700
and their parents maybe standing 
and watching me, and --

102
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,700
but that was about it.

103
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,300
You shouldn’t exaggerate.

104
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,700
I was over 20, 27.

105
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,700
I could drink alcohol in parties. 
It’s okay.

106
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,000
I wasn’t alarmed if a paparazzi 
caught me drinking.

107
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,700
It’s okay. I’m old enough.

108
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,700
So, everything within limits. 
Just pure common sense.

109
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,700
And talk to me about this, 
about writing.

110
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,700
So, you transitioned 
from being a host there.

111
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,700
You’re writing for these --

112
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,700
for a lot of different shows.

113
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,700
You appear in a lot of these 
shows as an actor yourself.

114
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,700
What is it about this writing 
that really caught your attention

115
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,700
because, again, you were 
going to be a psychologist?

116
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,700
You were going 
for organizational behavior.

117
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,700
How do you --?

118
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,700
Where does this writing 
aspect come from?

119
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,700
Well, I think it’s a bug.

120
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,700
It’s a bug in the system. 
And it’s a bug that --

121
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,700
it’s some sort of a tick 
that when it hits you

122
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,300
and if it’s right for you, 
it’s really hard.

123
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,700
It’s a pandemic.

124
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,300
A lot of people 
want to be famous,

125
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,700
but I never wanted to be famous.

126
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:23,700
Still, my main attraction 
to this area of --

127
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,700
to this career is not being famous.

128
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,700
So, what I really like is the --

129
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,700
you need to have 
any intermediate

130
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,000
between you and the audience.

131
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,700
It was very forward.

132
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,700
You could have touched them.

133
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,900
Yeah.

134
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,300
It was very, very immediate.

135
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,300
And I never knew 
I wanted to do it.

136
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,700
Sometimes, you’re very talented

137
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,000
in something 
you have not tried yet.

138
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,700
Maybe you’re a great cook 
or a great knitter.

139
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,700
I don’t know 
if you tried knitting.

140
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,700
- Have you tried it?
- Never in my life.

141
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,700
Maybe you’re very talented

142
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,700
- in knitting.
- Maybe.

143
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,700
And maybe someday, 
someone who’s

144
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:12,700
a great knitter will find 
this talent in you

145
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,700
and you’ll become a knitter.

146
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,700
Oh, I should change my name. 
It’s not my name here.

147
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,700
Okay. It’s Kobi Mahat

148
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,700
or [gibberish].

149
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,300
On the Zoom, it was Nissim 
or something. Wait.

150
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,700
Yeah.

151
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,300
But Kobi, I want to go 
to this moment

152
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,700
where you’re writing a show 
or your writing a movie,

153
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,700
and you work in it for years.

154
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,700
And you cast, 
and you get funding, and –

155
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,700
I never work on 
anything for years. Never.

156
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,700
Really?

157
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,700
Yes.

158
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,300
In the last six years, 
I’ve written

159
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,700
and directed six movies.

160
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,700
Six movies in six years.

161
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,700
And I think that’s 
an Israeli record.

162
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,700
And I’m all for 
immediate satisfactions.

163
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,700
I’m envious of people 
that can wait and dream

164
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:07,700
and sit on their ideas 
for so long.

165
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,700
I’m very, very fast.

166
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,700
When I’m getting 
into a new production,

167
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,700
I’m going in there 
like a bulldozer.

168
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,700
Sometimes, you have to 
attract sponsors --

169
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,700
Yeah.

170
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,700
-- to invest in the movie.

171
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:29,700
I’m not shy of begging people, 
of making presentation

172
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,700
of anything.

173
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,700
But I think --

174
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,700
and my record speaks for itself.

175
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,700
That’s unbelievable. 
Six movies in --

176
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,700
Just the Avatar, I think, 
took 30 years to produce.

177
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,700
It’s a great movie.

178
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,700
I’m not even in --

179
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,300
It’s not the same level.

180
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,700
- I'm not trying to say --
- No, no, no, of course, but --

181
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,700
But you know, Israel is 
a very small country.

182
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,700
And we have only, 
I don’t know,

183
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,300
about 9 million people.

184
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,700
- That's the --
- Yeah.

185
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,700
The population, it's very small.

186
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,700
So, the budgets for the movies 
are really small.

187
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,100
But as an Israeli, 
and everybody who has done

188
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,300
anything in Israel, 
whether it’s being

189
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,700
a tank commander 
in the Israeli army

190
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,700
or making a movie, 
you know that --

191
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,700
we know how to make a dollar 
and a half out of a dollar.

192
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
Definitely. Definitely.

193
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,300
And I always say also, 
especially here in my community,

194
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,700
in Silicon Valley and Stanford, 
when they ask me,

195
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,700
“Well, what is about Israeli 
that’s like the number one thing,”

196
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,700
I mainly say, 
"We get [expletive] done."

197
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,700
That's what it's about

198
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,700
- at the end.
- That's true.

199
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,700
That's true.

200
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,700
It is true. But Kobi -- so still, 
you work on a movie for a year

201
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,700
and it hits the theaters. 
It’s the premier.

202
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,700
You’re sitting down 
with your friends,

203
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,700
your family, 
the sponsors and the audience,

204
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,700
and this movie starts.

205
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,700
Is there a fear in you of 
how people will react to it?

206
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,700
How are people going to 
react to your masterpiece?

207
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,700
There’s excitement.

208
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:01,700
And the excitement 
stems also from --

209
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,700
a little bit from fear --

210
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,700
Yeah.

211
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,700
because in some sense, 
I considered myself --

212
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,300
I consider myself an artist. 
And artists, when you put your

213
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:16,300
art to the audience, 
it’s very different sometimes

214
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,700
the way they think.

215
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,700
Sometimes, when I plan a joke --

216
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,700
All of my movies are funny.

217
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,700
And when I plan 
a joke and I

218
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,300
think I know where the audience 
is going to laugh,

219
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:34,700
and they’re not laughing, 
it’s like a punch in the stomach.

220
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,700
On the other hand, 
sometimes, they laugh

221
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,700
when they weren’t meant to laugh.

222
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,700
Is it okay? 
Yes, it’s okay.

223
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,700
I was not embarrassed yet.

224
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,700
Hopefully, it’s not 
going to happen.

225
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,700
Amazing. Amazing.

226
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
Kobi, that fear though, is that --

227
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,700
I mean, I know a lot of people --

228
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,300
I’m a coder. 
I’m a software engineer

229
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,700
by profession and an investor.

230
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,700
And when I go and I look at deals, 
or I look at codes that I write

231
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,700
and I pass it onto others, 
I don’t really care

232
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,700
if they criticize it, 
if they say it’s awful.

233
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,700
Like, I have to redo it. 
It’s objective.

234
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,300
It’s science. It’s math.
But when you put an art

235
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,700
into something, 
you put heart there,

236
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,700
I’m sure it’s really hard
to make that distinction.

237
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,700
And maybe you 
haven’t gotten burned,

238
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,700
but is this something, 
a phenomena in the industry

239
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,700
that people are fearful of?

240
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,700
Or is this --?

241
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,300
- Or do you exemplify
- Everybody is --

242
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:22,800
it's common?

243
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
I’m fearful --

244
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:29,800
First of all, there are a couple of 
audiences that watches your film.

245
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,700
The first one

246
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,700
is the actual audience that buy 
tickets and go to the theater.

247
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,700
And they’re my main focus.

248
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:45,100
I want as many as I can 
to come to the theaters

249
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,700
and enjoy the movie. 
That’s my main focus.

250
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,700
The other kind of audience 
is the critics.

251
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,700
Right.

252
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,700
I really want the critics 
to like my movie.

253
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,700
But their opinion 
is only their opinion.

254
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,300
So, although it has 
some distribution,

255
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,700
maybe bigger than --

256
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,700
and it was one --

257
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,300
it hurts when someone writes 
something bad on your movie.

258
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,700
It happened to me.

259
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,700
The third audience is my 
sponsors and my investors.

260
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,700
I really want them to think 
it’s a good movie.

261
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:23,700
So, I’m mainly focused 
on the bigger audience,

262
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,700
the real people and my investors.

263
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,700
The others, I can live 
without their love.

264
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,700
How do you work?

265
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,300
I want to know your station.

266
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,300
Do you have a computer?

267
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,200
And when you write a script 
or a movie, do you just sit down

268
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
and start writing 
on a Word document?

269
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,700
Do you write it by hand 
on a big wall?

270
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,700
How does it work?

271
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,700
Oh, these days I’m actually 
thinking about a new idea.

272
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,700
I was just --

273
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,700
I’m just done with the filming 
of my new movie

274
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,300
and it’s now 
in the process of editing.

275
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:54,800
Okay.

276
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,000
So, I’m actually thinking 
about the new idea.

277
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,700
I don’t know 
if it’s going to be a movie

278
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,700
or a series, or whatever.

279
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,700
But I'm like --

280
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,700
It’s a stew inside my head.

281
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,700
I’m thinking about it a lot.

282
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:12,700
And for the last four days, 
I think I have a story

283
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,700
in my head.

284
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,700
And I’m thinking about 
tomorrow star --

285
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,700
sitting in front of my PC,

286
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,700
a stationary, computer, 
not a laptop,

287
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,700
not an iPad, not in a restaurant 
or a coffee shop.

288
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,700
In my house, in my small room, 
the one I’m sitting here

289
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,700
right now,

290
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,700
and I just started writing drafts.

291
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,700
Is it just like word vomit?

292
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,700
Do you just write 
as much as you can,

293
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,700
and then sleep on it and revise?

294
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,700
Or do you really think 
through every --?

295
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,700
No, I think through.

296
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,700
I think it’s true 
and nevertheless,

297
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,700
some of it is vomit.

298
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,700
Some of it is going 
to be erased in a day,

299
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,700
and a new thing 
is going to come up.

300
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,700
It’s a process of, 
I don’t know,

301
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,700
two weeks to write 
just the synopsis,

302
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,700
that three good pages of

303
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,700
- Wow!
- the story with all the outlines

304
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,700
and the main 
characters and everything.

305
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,700
Do you miss going back 
in front of the camera

306
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,700
and being the star?

307
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,700
I’m still in front of the camera.

308
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:22,700
Actually, until the COVID9 
pandemic, I had a daily show

309
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,700
six days a week 
with Yael Bar Zohar.

310
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,700
It was called the Daily Report.

311
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,700
Yeah.

312
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,700
Six days a week. 
So, I’m pretty much

313
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,700
every day on TV.

314
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,700
And it’s a major 
broadcaster in --

315
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,700
It’s Reshet.

316
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,700
And I’ve just --

317
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,700
Since the COVID-19 
pandemic happened,

318
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,700
we were laid off.

319
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:49,300
But I was just given 
the very pleasant news

320
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,000
today that we’re coming 
back next week.

321
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,700
So, I’m still on TV.

322
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,700
- It’s a really –
- But it’s a very --

323
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,700
But it’s very different,

324
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,700
in this kind of TV than what you

325
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,700
write because it’s 
two different worlds.

326
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,700
One you’re a host.

327
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,000
The report with Yael Bar Zohar, 
it’s a great show.

328
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,700
But you’re not acting. 
You’re hosting.

329
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,700
And then, you’re a fiction writer 
for movies and series

330
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,700
where it’s completely made up,

331
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,700
stories that you’re 
creating, right?

332
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,700
Yeah, but it’s no different than 
you being a great cook

333
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,700
and being a computer engineer.

334
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
Right.

335
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,700
I mean, we all have --

336
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,700
some of the things 
I don’t like on the little screen

337
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,700
or the big screen 
is that it tries --

338
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:38,700
people are always trying to make 
a two-dimension picture of you.

339
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,700
I’m a three-dimension person and –

340
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,700
- I love it! I love it.
- I have a lot of interests.

341
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,700
So, I can write and I can host, 
and I can do a couple of --

342
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,700
I actually can cook.

343
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,700
I’m a really good 
[flutter], I think.

344
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,200
- So, I have a lot of interests
- I love it.

345
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,700
and one of them gives me 
the relief from the other.

346
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,300
I mean, if I only 
did writing or directing,

347
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,300
I would go crazy.

348
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,300
Also, if I was only a host,

349
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:11,300
I’d probably be 
in a sanctuary right now.

350
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:17,300
This passion that you have of 
trying inter-disciplinary things

351
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,300
and doing all to your passions 
shines through the screen.

352
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,300
But I want one piece of advice 
that you would give to

353
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,300
any young person, 
not necessary much of --

354
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,300
neural coder, actor, 
musician, whatever,

355
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:32,700
any person who wants to go 
after their dream,

356
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,700
is a little bit hesitant.

357
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,300
And from what I learned, and I 
didn’t know all this about you,

358
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,700
is about how passionate 
you are about going through things

359
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,700
that you enjoy 
and that you really love

360
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,700
without being scared of 
what others will say.

361
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,700
Or whether it fits this scenario 
box people are trying

362
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,700
to put you on.

363
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,700
Yeah. I think my main advice --

364
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,300
I give advice to a lot 
of young people.

365
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,700
A lot of people approached me 
and ask for my advice,

366
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,700
want to send me scripts 
they’ve written from

367
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,700
the ages of 14 until the --

368
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:09,700
I don’t know, the oldest -- 
I’ve got a script from was

369
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,400
I think, 65.

370
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:11,900
Wow!

371
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,700
And I never turned down nobody.

372
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,700
I read.

373
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,700
I read and I give them advice.

374
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,700
- I'm not always -- 
- Wow!

375
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,700
I cannot always help,

376
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,700
and I can’t always 
take their idea and --

377
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,700
but I give them advice 
and maybe some pinpoints

378
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,700
- how to make it better. 
- Wow!

379
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:36,700
Sometimes, it’s not good enough 
and I tell the truth, softly.

380
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,700
But I’m telling the truth always.

381
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,700
My main advice for those 
people is to be --

382
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,700
stay very, very curious.

383
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,700
When you’re curious as I am, 
you explore.

384
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,700
And when you explore, 
you discover a lot of things.

385
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:59,300
The way I’ve become a director 
was through me being the host

386
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,300
and the writer.

387
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,700
I was watching the people 
that I work with.

388
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,700
I wanted to know 
what kind of camera they use.

389
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,700
Why are they using these kind of 
dolly and not the other one?

390
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:15,700
How can you make this effective 
than the other, and so on?

391
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,700
And I taught myself a little bit 
of editing, and a little bit of

392
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,300
content editing, 
and a lot of things that are not

393
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:30,700
necessarily exactly directing, 
but I’ve broadened my horizons.

394
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,700
And when I’ve done that, 
I think I’ve become a better

395
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,700
host and a better director.

396
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,700
So being curious is

397
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,700
- I love it. 
- very, very important.

398
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,700
I love it. So, Kobi, 
three words that describe you.

399
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,700
One of them is curious. 
I’m going to use that already.

400
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,300
I just wanted to  say curious, 
curious and curious

401
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,700
because I think --

402
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,700
a lot of people think 
being smart --

403
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,700
okay, I’ll give you another 
one that I’m very good at.

404
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,700
I’m very organized.

405
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,700
Okay.

406
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,700
And one of the psychologists 
I worked with,

407
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,700
I had a very interesting show 
on television

408
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,700
with Professor Amos [unclear].

409
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,700
He taught me that --

410
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:15,700
He always says that the person 
who succeed in life

411
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:21,700
is the one who’s organized 
over the one who’s smart.

412
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,300
And I mean, 
it’s very good to be both.

413
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,700
But if you had to choose one,

414
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,700
being organized is very, 
very important.

415
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,700
And I’m very --

416
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,700
If you can see my table here, 
it’s very organized.

417
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:39,700
And I think because I do 
all sorts of things

418
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,700
and there's a lot of 
scrambled eggs inside my head,

419
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:47,700
I need some 
organization to the system.

420
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,300
And being organized 
is a very important thing.

421
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,700
Being curious is very important.

422
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:59,700
And I think the third, which 
I’m not sure I’m always good at

423
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,700
but is very important 
to stay humble

424
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:08,700
And I say that because, 
of course, as a person on TV,

425
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,700
I also made the same --
of hubris.

426
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,700
Everybody does that 
on television.

427
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:21,700
We tend to think that the sun 
shines from our butts.

428
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,700
It’s never true.

429
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,700
And times like this, 
like COVID-19.

430
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:33,000
and what it made to our industry, 
made a lot of people

431
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,300
very, very humble.

432
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,700
And being humble 
in the first place

433
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,700
gives you a soft 
cushion to land on.

434
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,700
I love it. Kobi, I can’t believe 
20 minutes are up.

435
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,700
It was so inspiring.

436
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,300
Toda raba for all the information

437
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,700
and for giving me 
so much enjoyment

438
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,700
growing up, really.

439
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,700
Thank you very much. 
This is actually a footage

440
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,700
from my new film.

441
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,700
- It’s called “Full Speed."
- Oh!

442
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,700
Full Speed. 
When is it --?

443
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,700
Is it going to be in theaters?

444
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,700
How do we even watch it
after COVID-19?

445
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,700
Oh, of course. It’s going to be --

446
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:11,700
Well, the premier is supposed
to be on August, 1st of August.

447
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,700
Hopefully, if everything 
is going to be okay

448
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,700
with the COVID-19 thing --

449
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:22,700
actually, we’re depending 
on the Hollywood industry,

450
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:31,700
to release their films that will 
ignite the Israeli film industry.

451
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,700
- Yeah.
- So, I’m going to be ready.

452
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:39,700
And it’s a great movie 
about women strength.

453
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,700
It’s really good.

454
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,700
I can’t wait. Kobi –

455
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,700
Written by a man.

456
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,700
Thank you very much, Michael.

457
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,700
Toda raba.

458
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,700
- Yeah.
- All right.

459
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,300
Bye-bye.

460
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,700
Bye-bye.
