Shiran Melamdovsky Somech, how are you? I'm great, thank you. And it's finally it's great to meet you. Really good to be here. First of all, did I say your name correctly? Actually, yes. Okay, so all the rehearsing that we did before this paid off. Shiran, I can't wait for this conversation because we have so much to talk about from your work at Drive TLV to the two communities that you're a part of, Yazamiyot and Saleet. Really incredible incredible missions. And I'd love to talk both about your day job, but also your night job as you referred to it and some of the impact that you're making on women in Israel and the world. So, maybe you can take me back a little bit and give me a little bit of an overview of what you do at Drive TLV and then transition into what are these two other communities that you are a big part of? Sure. So, Drive it's an Innovation Center for smart mobility. And we are working together with eight different partners. And what is so unique with our partner that they create kind of a wide range of domains. So today, many people think that mobility is related to automotive, it's maybe kind of a very narrow world, but it's much much more than that. And today, we are working with our partners so many different domain. It could be infrastructure, industry 4.0, smart cities, logistic and delivery. Even marketing, insurance, and finance. So, it's amazing. So, what is the end mission? For us, so we are pretty focused and drive to create competitive advantage both for our partners and our startups. And what does that tangibly mean? So, you're sitting in Tel Aviv and what does the organization actually do with these partnerships and with these startups? So in the first phase, we create kind of a friction with as many startup in the Israeli ecosystem. We know how to create value for them from day one. It could be a business opportunity with our partners using our connection, knowledge. We have a lot of workshop and meetups. We bring people from all over the world and so on. Also, we're agnostic to the startup stage. Could be early stage, mature, round A, round B, and even public companies. So in the second phase, we find some promising startup, and we offer them to sit in co-work workspace for free for a few months. We consider this as a ... due diligence. So, they have the opportunity to learn about us, about our value and so on. And then for us to learn about them, about the team, their progress, their technology. And the third and the most important phase for them, we have the FastLane program. This is a program that I'm running. It's a drive commercialization program. And it's relevant for cutting edge technology startups, and also startups that are relevant to our partners needs. And we are working pretty intense with those startups during five months. And we assist them to meet the market, because usually they are coming to us when they are very familiar with the technology but not too familiar with the market. A true Israeli story. Exactly. And we have this kind of process with the startup. Also we have a parallel process with the partner. We're working pretty tight with our partners as well. We assist them to adapt and adjust the technology. And also, of course, now we're working with a startup and the corporate, now we need to create the touch point between those two. And it's usually in regular days like before the covid. So, we have a ... show. We visit our partner in the headquarter in Japan, Sweden, and the US. Yes, it was super amazing. And we had kind of a presentation in front of the top executive, the CEO, the CTO, top engineer. And we create kind of a consensus to drive in the startup. And after we build this consensus, everyone say, "Wow. Drive it's so amazing. and such a great startup. We have to work with those." Now after the CEO say that, so then it's easier to move forward to the next stage. And then we create a B2B with relevant business unit, and they're talking about their technology and how to move forward. And I mean, it's a collaboration. So very, very strategic partnerships between the startups and helping them get into this very mature market already, right, with very, very big players that I'm guessing. Getting contracts with them and getting them to come on board is very very difficult. And having somebody like Drive TLV facilitate that communication and that strategy is something that I'm sure is very very helpful. Before I ask the why, I want to ask the how. What is happening with mobility right now, in the world or in Israel, that you're seeing some of the trends in 2020? Obviously we have autonomous vehicles, we have electric vehicles. But what in the world of mobility are we still missing some interesting opportunities that we hope to see soon? So first, I will consider to what's happened those days. We cannot ignore to the covid effect. So first of all, the automotive is booming, but probably only if you're a Tesla. So for the other companies, there is a big slowdown in the manufacture and sales as well. Less attention to innovation and working with startups also in some of the time. However, we can recognize also new opportunities. Like there is a new normal. We are not sure what is going to stay and how the world's going to look like, but for now, there is a new normal, there is new challenges. We call it opportunity you know the cliche for making lemonade. But this is what we're trying to do. We are trying to be proactive. So we recognize, for example, that many fleets There is a car that's just standing there in a parking lots with no use at all. And we approach our startup and we assist them to adjust their technology. So, for example, we have a solar panel company that now it protect the vehicle battery. And also, we recognize there is the rental car, for example. There is no use for rental car today, however there is increase in the demand for delivery. So we took this rental car together with the startup and a system to use it as a delivery vehicle and ... utilization of the fleets. So it's amazing. For those two startup it's amazing opportunity. Very, very cool. Okay. So, I want to make sure that we leave enough time to talk about the two other organizations which are just wonderful. Talk to me a little bit about Yazamiyot. This great community of females that are working together to promote women in entrepreneurship and leadership positions. But tell me a little bit about, first of all, Yazamiyot, for the English speakers means female entrepreneurs, right. That's the name of the community? Exactly. It's not exactly international name, but this is exactly the meaning of Yazamiyot. And it was established, I think it was the first and the leading community in Israel for propelling forward female entrepreneurs in the high tech industry. And established like more than 10 years ago by a serial entrepreneur named Hilla Ovil-Brenner. And what we do in Yazamiyot it's actually give the female entrepreneur hooks. We want to be productive and to assist them to give them relevant tools so they can build successful companies. And we collaborate with leading IT company as Google campus. We create Google campus for moms, for females in maternity leave. That instead of stay at home and have a massage courses for babies, they have the opportunity to get some relevant tool and follow their dream and change the world. I remember that, I think it was five or six years ago, I came to the Google campus offices back in the old location. And I remember I walk in and there is like 20, 30 moms with their babies sitting there in Google campus working together. It was incredible. It was really incredible. So, this is an amazing initiative and it also became worldwide in Google. And now actually we finished another accelerative program for more mature startups. This time with no babies. Just the entrepreneurs themselves. And together with Microsoft. And it was a very interesting program. This time we did it during the covid. So we did mostly during Zoom or Google Meet, the Microsoft platform. And I think it was a very very interesting period, because the female founder, specifically in those time, need guidance and assistance. Right. So, talk to me a little bit more broadly about female entrepreneurship in Israel, something that you're now very familiar and involved with. What are some of the trends that you've seen over the past decade or so and perhaps where are we today and what do we hope to become in a few years as Yazamiyot is trying to move the needle there? I think this is a very important question. Today we are talking about like 7% of female founder. It's a very low number. Just a quick reminder, we are 51% of the population. And from my experience, I recognize two main reason for that. The first one, the gates to Silicon Valley and to a successful startup company start with, have funding. So usually startup in the early stage don't really have a product, don't really have a product market fit, don't have income or revenue or whatever. So, usually the investment is based on chemistry between the founders and the venture capital. And because there are mostly 9% of the investor are male, so it's a bit more difficult for female to build this trust and those chemistry and to get funding. Interesting. So, just to recap. What you're saying is one thing that you've noticed is because the beginning of the cycle is that the majority of the venture capital partners in Israel are males, and they make their pre-seed or seed investments primarily based on the chemistry with the team because there's still very little, perhaps annual revenue. It's still, there is not necessarily a product market fit, so they base it off of chemistry. And just traditionally, usually male investors will have better chemistry with male founders. So, it sounds like what you're saying is that the touchpoint is not just in getting more female entrepreneurs, it's actually also getting more female venture capital partners who will help drive that investment into female founders, right? Did I get that right? Yes, totally. You've got it right. And this is one of the biggest barrier for a female founder. And the second one is also related to what you just mentioned. It's women don't have enough technical skills. There's not enough technical female. So also I heard some theory call it the leaking pipe. So you start in high school, it's 50% boys and girls study the mathematics and computer science and so on. But then in the army and then in the university, the number become much lower. And then in the IT company. And this is reflect both about the skills itself, so it's very important to have those technical skills in the technical companies. And also in the network. Women usually- So what does that mean? Yeah. Women usually don't have the right network because they weren't part of the technical units in the army. And they usually don't be in the university in the relevant studies and so on. Okay. So, the first one we talked about was this idea that we need more women in venture capital positions to make those decisions, to invest in female entrepreneurs. But inherently, we also need more female technical founders that are coming in from this background and they don't fall within the pipeline. And I actually had a few fascinating conversations with female engineers on this show. And very similarly, they were talking about this decision making process in high school, especially in Israel, you have to sort of choose your path, right, already in high school what you're gonna be studying. And so that's a very interesting junction right before you go into the military. And I want to leave enough time to talk about Saleet because it's a very, while it's similar, I mean the idea about helping females, but it's on a very different level. So, talk to me a little bit about what Saleet is and what you're trying to do over there. So, Saleet is a nonprofit organization power Tel Aviv municipality and the government. And it's to help women in prostitution. So, it's kind of different phase- Very different. yes, in my life. And it was very important to me to, this is a topic that's very, very important to me to assist those female that are not equal and part of this society. So in Saleet, in the first phase, the first detect the prostitution, the prostitute, and then give them shelter like a kind of a protection ... sleep. Sleep over, grab some food, hiding from their pimp or whatever. And then after they build the trust, they can offer them rehabilitation. To offer them to some treatment. It could be a psychologist treatment or personal group therapy. And also give them some tool to be integrate in the society again. So, how do you even get started with waking up and saying, "Now I want to work on a nonprofit that will help women in prostitution?" There's so many different issues. I mean, what drove you specifically to this issue that you said, "Okay, this is what I want to start spending my nights on." Because you obviously have a full time job. You're very involved with Yazamiyot, yet you're taking on this another project which technically sounds like another full time job. This is a very good question. I'm not sure I have the answer for that. I was always attract to assist women in human trafficking, sex trafficking, and so on. I never had the opportunity to do it. I just read about this and I was thinking how awful it is and how the world and the society can make this happen. Right. And while I finish my degree and I have some free time, like people looking for hobbies, so I call Saleet my hobby. Wow. Well that's whats inspiring. Instead of going dancing or do something else, it was very interesting. And this topic, I think, is super important because like those female, and this is also something I understand along the way. In the beginning I thought, my state of mind was We should do the prostitution to be legal. To make it legal. To give them the rights. They should pay fees and so on. But after a while, after I was more involved in Saleet and understand what's happened to those women, so I understand that they don't do it from choice. It's not like freedom of occupation stuff. It's not. Like most of them, 90% they're in childhood, they have like self abuse. So, it's not like the easy choice to make easy money. It's far away from that. And ... society need to do something and to assist these women. So what is the vision that you are seeing in the coming years with Saleet? The vision. I wish that they're talking a lot about new regulation in this field. And it's something that it look positive. They're talking about it for a while and also it looked positive for a while as well. But there is no government, sustainable government, so it's very difficult. But the regulation, I think is right, and this is what we are talking about, is to prevent the prostitution at all. Right. But from the customer side, to cut the demand. If there is no demand, so no be prostitutes. Right. Classic economics. Yes. That makes sense. Well, I just want to say that it sounds like all the programs that you're running along in your night job, right, after your day job with Drive TLV, it's completely inspiring and I'm getting personally a lot of inspiration, because I think that at the end, you can feel the energy that you're bringing to these programs and saying that your hobby is to help women in prostitution through a nonprofit that you're making a scalable impact, I think that that's wonderful and I think it's such an incredible hobby to have if you can call it even a hobby. But before we leave, I have to ask you the most important question. I need three words that you would use to describe yourself. Oh, tough one. The hardest one. Yeah. I think the first one is stamina, empowerment, and people person. Stamina, empowerment, and people person. Shiran, thank you again for your generous time and effort. It sounds like you're doing really really fantastic things. And I can't wait to see the impact of both Yazamiyot and Saleet and to continue following your journey in Drive TLV. Thank you very much. Thank you for the opportunity. Bye. Take care.
