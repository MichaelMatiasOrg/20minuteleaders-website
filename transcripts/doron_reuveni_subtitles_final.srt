2
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,360
Doron Reuveni, thank you so much

3
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,360
for joining me on the show.

4
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,240
My pleasure.

5
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,680
Really great to have you.

6
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,280
You're the CEO of Applause now.

7
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,600
A fantastic company that I actually,

8
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,520
I've been following quite closely

9
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,880
ever since my time in the IDF

10
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,600
and building software myself.

11
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,120
But I'd love to get started

12
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,000
by getting to know you a little bit better.

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,920
How you've come to Applause

14
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,920
to be the CEO,

15
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,680
you actually were also

16
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,640
the board member of RunKeeper, right?

17
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,480
Yeah, I was

18
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,920
until it was actually sold

19
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,480
to ASICS at the time.

20
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,440
So, I do like to take a few

21
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,680
independent board seats

22
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,800
and help young entrepreneurs and CEOs

23
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,160
grow their company.

24
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,680
And I did it a few times.

25
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,200
One was RunKeeper, I think three years ago.

26
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,520
And one was GrabCAD,

27
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,980
that was another company

28
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,680
that I was on the board on -

29
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,720
Well, I love RunKeeper.

30
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,920
I actually use it almost on a daily basis

31
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,720
to run.

32
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,080
So, as soon as I saw it

33
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,040
I got so excited.

34
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,960
Doron, tell me,

35
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,080
what is it like to be a board member

36
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:03,410
of a sort of B2C company where

37
00:03:03,415 --> 00:03:05,240
there's so much engagement with the users

38
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,920
and the growth is tremendous.

39
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,320
What is your role as a board member

40
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,440
for a company like RunKeeper?

41
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah. So RunKeeper is actually

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,120
a very good example

43
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,160
because first of all,

44
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,360
for me it was very interesting

45
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,000
because they had a great founder.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,960
I always love working

47
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,760
with a great founder.

48
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,040
I just give you an example.

49
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,320
You know, he was the first one

50
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,400
that came with a mobile app

51
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,840
that tracks your running

52
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,840
and creates a running community.

53
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,440
And at the beginning, he had no funding.

54
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,600
So, he was actually running

55
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,000
the Boston Marathon with this,

56
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,880
like, iPhone outfit.

57
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,520
So, he was so passionate about it.

58
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,040
He was running with an iPhone app.

59
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,400
And you can probably look it up.

60
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,840
It's actually pretty interesting -

61
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,280
I'm gonna put it right over here

62
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,640
with my tremendous editing.

63
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,400
So, right over here,

64
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,680
there's gonna be a picture of him

65
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,040
running with the iPhone outfit.

66
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,520
Yeah, I can probably send it to you.

67
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,240
We're still good friends.

68
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,040
And for me,

69
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,880
it was a very interesting type of endeavor

70
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,840
because my background

71
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,680
is in B2B and enterprise software.

72
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,040
And RunKeeper is obviously a B2C company.

73
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,360
And actually one of the first one

74
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,200
that focused on

75
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,720
mobile application in iPhone.

76
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,720
And it was for me a very good endeavor

77
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,920
into the metrics and analytics

78
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,720
of a big company.

79
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,560
And one of the reasons

80
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,920
that I joined is

81
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,200
gain some more experience

82
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,320
in the B2C space,

83
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,000
but also kind of help RunKeeper,

84
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,800
because what happened to them is

85
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,680
they was the first one

86
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,880
that actually came out,

87
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,320
but they were not,

88
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,280
they were getting their lunch

89
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,800
eaten a little bit by companies

90
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,880
like Strava that came

91
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,080
from the cycling world.

92
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,440
And there was a few other examples,

93
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,920
a few companies that were acquired

94
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,680
by Under Armour, etc, etc.

95
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,080
So we had to kind of, me and the investors, had to

96
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,560
figure out a way together with the CEO

97
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,280
to put the company on a trajectory

98
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,160
to continued growth and success.

99
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,720
And eventually we did that.

100
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,960
And that was actually sold to ASICS,

101
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,120
which is a running shoe company

102
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,280
I guess. That was a great success for them

103
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,680
to ... and the team.

104
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,360
And now they're basically part

105
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,880
of the digital,

106
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,480
I would say digital agency of ASICS.

107
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,200
So, everything digital for ASICS is

108
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,880
actually going through the RunKeeper.

109
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,160
Wow.

110
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:18,720
My job as an independent board member,

111
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,120
and I think this is very important

112
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,920
for CEOs and young entrepreneurs

113
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,400
to understand, is that

114
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,240
your investors and you as a CEO

115
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,240
don't always have an alignment

116
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,920
in regards to your goal.

117
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,960
And investors need to take care

118
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,080
of their investment.

119
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,240
The CEO needs to take care of the company,

120
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,080
the employees, the management team.

121
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,520
And sometimes that creates a challenge.

122
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,120
Right.

123
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,440
Many times they're aligned

124
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,760
in order to grow the company

125
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,000
because the company is doing well.

126
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,640
Everybody is successful.

127
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,640
But many times

128
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,120
there is a certain amount of friction.

129
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,200
And I think the role

130
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,000
of an independent board member

131
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,160
is to actually play that role

132
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,880
where his incentive is not the investor.

133
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,800
His incentive is not the VC.

134
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,320
His incentive is not necessarily the CEO.

135
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,920
There's one thing that he sees

136
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,520
that he really cares about,

137
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,280
and that's the company.

138
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,880
And being a good independent board member

139
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,000
is like super critical

140
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,200
to the success of the company

141
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,160
because you actually

142
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,800
bring together employees, CEOs,

143
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,440
management team,

144
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,760
and actually the investors

145
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,080
and actually bring them together

146
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,240
on the same path.

147
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,800
Sometimes it's not an easy job,

148
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,440
but you've gotta make sure that

149
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,800
you always think about

150
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
what's best for the company.

151
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,200
And that's what a

152
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,840
good independent board member does. And I -

153
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:41,240
Do you feel a part of the company?

154
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,680
Do you feel like you have

155
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,680
a stake in the company emotionally?

156
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,880
Or do you feel more of an adviser

157
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,560
that is overlooking this operation?

158
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,160
And obviously you have the best interest

159
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,960
in mind for both the CEO and the company,

160
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,480
but how connected are you

161
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,360
to the mission and the values

162
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,720
that the company exudes?

163
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,320
So I'm very connected.

164
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,640
And that basically means that

165
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,480
I would never take

166
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,120
an independent board seat

167
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,880
without investing in the company myself.

168
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,560
Oh, okay.

169
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,960
But that's me personally.

170
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,840
Not every independent board member

171
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,000
does that.

172
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:13,840
So, why is that?

173
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,400
Why do you do that?

174
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,600
I do that in order to make sure that

175
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,280
it's important to me

176
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,320
to think about the company first.

177
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,480
Okay.

178
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,720
So, that's me.

179
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,640
By the way, I learned things from

180
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,560
an independent board member that I had

181
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,720
when I was in Applause.

182
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,480
His name was ...

183
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,320
He actually sold a company to IBM

184
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,560
for about three billion dollars.

185
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,960
But he was my independent board member.

186
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,600
And he invested in my company

187
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,000
and I learned from him that

188
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,680
if you wanna truly become a

189
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,120
good independent board member

190
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,040
and help the CEOs and the VCs

191
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,200
grow a company,

192
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,920
you've gotta have an incentive

193
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,320
to make the company successful.

194
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,680
And if you put your money

195
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,440
where your mouth is,

196
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,600
that is always very helpful

197
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,720
because you never forget.

198
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,680
And I always invest in those companies.

199
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,520
And I would say I was,

200
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,880
I probably were part of five companies

201
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,640
where I was an independent board member.

202
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,760
And I think I had four very good

203
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,200
successes and one failure,

204
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,960
which is not bad.

205
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,240
It's pretty fantastic,

206
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,000
pretty fantastic statistics.

207
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,680
Wonderful.

208
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,280
Doron, talk to me about Applause.

209
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,240
Writing software is difficult.

210
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,960
"Software is eating the world"

211
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,160
is a quote by Marc Andreessen himself.

212
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,000
What is Applause

213
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,800
and why is it so relevant

214
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,280
as the years go by?

215
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,920
Because it's been here for some time.

216
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,080
Yes. So, Applause has been around

217
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,040
for about 11 years.

218
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,400
I would say when the company got started,

219
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,000
and I'm also the co-founder

220
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,120
of the company,

221
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,920
the idea was really simple at the time.

222
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,640
The idea was

223
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,360
we invest a lot of money

224
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,760
in testing software.

225
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,240
People, process, methodology, tools.

226
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,320
But when software gets

227
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,160
to the hands of real people,

228
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,960
there's still multiple issues

229
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,520
that gets found.

230
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,160
And we always need to remember

231
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,040
that the reason why

232
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,560
we develop software

233
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,400
is in order to serve humans.

234
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:09,840
Right?

235
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,960
Right.

236
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,600
That's really why we develope software,

237
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,200
why everybody developes software.

238
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,520
And the idea was really simple.

239
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,440
Why aren't we successful?

240
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,120
The point was

241
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,440
we're actually missing a step.

242
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,080
And the step was actually

243
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,680
testing in the wild.

244
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,400
Actually simulating and mimicking

245
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,640
your real users, your real customers.

246
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,000
And that's the way to find issues

247
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,760
that they never found

248
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,440
in a lab environment,

249
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,760
found by automation.

250
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,960
And the idea was simple:

251
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,520
Why don't we build

252
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,520
a global community of test engineers

253
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,040
and test in the wild

254
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,360
on real devices,

255
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,240
real configurations.

256
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,880
At scale, at speed, in real time,

257
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,640
24/7, 365.

258
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,040
And that's actually what we came about.

259
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,120
Indeed we actually built

260
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,880
a technology platform

261
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,680
that on one end side integrates with the

262
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,040
product development life cycle.

263
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,300
... tracking system and CI/CD

264
00:09:59,302 --> 00:09:59,920
and on the other end side

265
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,520
manages a global community of

266
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,760
software tech engineers

267
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,040
which is today more than half a million

268
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,080
community members

269
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,240
from 200 countries and regions worldwide.

270
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,720
And you can think it's a simple idea

271
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,440
meaning you take a software product

272
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,920
an iPhone app, an IOT app,

273
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,600
whatever it is,

274
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,120
and throw it over the wall

275
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,000
to bunch of people.

276
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,200
But it's not really like that

277
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,400
because let's talk about the complexity.

278
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,520
If you take Uber as an example,

279
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,080
they actually match

280
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,840
a driver and a passenger

281
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,160
for a single point in time

282
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,680
for a single ride, single transaction.

283
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,960
We actually match a dedicated team

284
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,320
with a software product

285
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,040
on an ongoing basis

286
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,880
and the team needs to fix

287
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,880
the experience of the software product.

288
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,520
And there's communication

289
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,600
and collaboration,

290
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,040
and it's done in real time 24/7.

291
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,640
So, the technology

292
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,760
and obviously incentives for the testers

293
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,120
in order to align incentives

294
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,160
with what the company is looking for.

295
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,520
So, the complexity is actually really high

296
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,640
from a technology platform perspective.

297
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,440
And I would also say

298
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,480
most of our customers are

299
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,600
big enterprise companies.

300
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,160
So, when you look at your iPhone

301
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,280
or Android device, I am happy to say

302
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,880
that probably 50 or 60%

303
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,200
of the apps that you have out there

304
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,320
are probably tested by Applause.

305
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,880
And that includes companies like

306
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,880
Google and Microsoft and Amazon,

307
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,680
but also big retailers and media companies,

308
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,360
and many types of enterprise companies

309
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,280
that really focus on making

310
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,880
their customers and users successful.

311
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,800
Right. Doron, this concept of

312
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,920
testing in the wild,

313
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,320
I think that's so interesting

314
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,400
because almost every software team

315
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,360
in the world today

316
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,200
has this notion of quality testing.

317
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,840
Both software testing.

318
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,680
Test driven methodology or QA team

319
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:53,520
that runs and does a 100 manual test cases.

320
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,200
I know in the in the Army,

321
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,640
in 8200 where I served,

322
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,120
we spent days testing every software

323
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,720
to make sure we don't have any errors.

324
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,120
What is the difference between

325
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,520
testing in the wild and the notion of

326
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,080
doing tests in-house within your company?

327
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,960
Why is that different?

328
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,120
Yes. So, I think two things

329
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,080
basically happen

330
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,880
if you test in-house,

331
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,800
you actually are testing

332
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,880
in a single location

333
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,680
and you have a limited

334
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,040
amount of devices that you test it on.

335
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,320
It's also very tiring to test, right.

336
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,280
It's very repetitive type of task

337
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,760
that you're not actually doing,

338
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,800
journeys and use cases,

339
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,400
and exploratory like a real user would do.

340
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,200
And that's exactly what we do.

341
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,880
Take the most simple example,

342
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,280
take HBO Go.

343
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,480
Can you test HBO Go from China?

344
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,240
From Vietnam?

345
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,400
No, they don't even have

346
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,480
distribution rates over there -

347
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,200
And these are average regular people

348
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,120
sitting at home who can sign up

349
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,040
and have incentives to go

350
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,000
and just download the app

351
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,120
and play with it.

352
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,200
And they can perhaps go through

353
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,560
a list of tasks

354
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,600
or they can just do a free for all

355
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,480
and for every bug that they find,

356
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,000
they get some incentive for it, right?

357
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:04,760
That's correct.

358
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,240
But it's not only like that.

359
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,840
It's actually a dedicated team.

360
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,760
And we actually do automatic matching.

361
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,920
So if I'm any type of company,

362
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,040
let's say I'm WalMart testing my

363
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,560
Walmart application.

364
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,240
You want to make sure

365
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,720
that you test it in areas where

366
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,560
there is a Walmart.

367
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,160
You wanna make sure

368
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,360
that you do customer journey.

369
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,520
Do, order from your mobile phone

370
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,960
and pick it up at the store.

371
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,800
You want to make sure

372
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,320
that the whole experience

373
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,840
actually works well.

374
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,560
And that's what's really being tested.

375
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,160
And you wanna make sure

376
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,320
that you test it on devices

377
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,600
that are in North America

378
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,860
in central locations where they rolled out

379
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,880
pick up in store.

380
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,760
You actually wanna really simulate

381
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:44,520
and mimic the users,

382
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,200
but you also want to have good testers

383
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,000
that have experience and expertise

384
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,920
and have them dedicated to the work

385
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,520
on an ongoing basis and have incentive

386
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,880
to actually look for the things

387
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,600
that you care about

388
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,400
because many times when

389
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,680
you hire a team in India,

390
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,360
they just run through test cases.

391
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,160
Right.

392
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,680
This is a little bit more than that

393
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,040
because there's incentives to actually find fault

394
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,240
that the customer is looking for

395
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,160
so he can fix it

396
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,320
and basically launch a

397
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,320
better product into the market.

398
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,600
But this isn't instead of the QA

399
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,240
on the team or internal testing, right?

400
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,800
This is as a supplement

401
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,720
to really go the extra mile and say,

402
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,600
"Yes, we have caught 80 or 85%

403
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,600
of the bugs on our end our testing cycles"

404
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,520
but there will inevitably be

405
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,680
10 to 15% out in the wild

406
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,600
because of weird devices,

407
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,920
and screen resolutions,

408
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,360
and Wi-Fi and country VPNs, right?

409
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,480
Well, the honest truth is that

410
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,760
they actually started like that.

411
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,840
It started that augmentation to ...

412
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,440
but as we evolved and matured

413
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,680
as a company,

414
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,280
today we manage the complete cycle

415
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,520
for a lot of our customers

416
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,800
on an ongoing basis.

417
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,400
Right.

418
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,680
So, I would say that both

419
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,840
models are available.

420
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,240
If you wanna have your own team

421
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,120
and kind of augment it, that's fine.

422
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,120
If you wanna have us take ownership

423
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,360
of everything including automation,

424
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,160
So, today, over time, we built

425
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,680
technology that allows you

426
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,720
to do automation,

427
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,360
that allows you to do accessibility

428
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,280
testing which is supercritical

429
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,520
for every mobile

430
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,720
and web application today.

431
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,360
If you wanna make sure

432
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,720
that you do voice testing.

433
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,040
You wanna make sure that you do

434
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,280
data collection for AI and ML engine at

435
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
very high quality

436
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,360
and then test the engine.

437
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,920
So, we actually today do all that.

438
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,840
And I think one very important thing

439
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,640
to note is that

440
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,880
many teams look at automation

441
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,200
and manual testing as separate.

442
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,600
We actually look at the very holistic way,

443
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,160
look at it in a very holistic way.

444
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,480
So, automation and manual testing

445
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,640
in the wild

446
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,280
and test case execution

447
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,920
and exploratory testing

448
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,560
need to work in harmony.

449
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,640
So, our platform today

450
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,200
is a true digital quality platform

451
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,920
that allows you

452
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,600
to actually bring all of it together

453
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,960
into a single metric

454
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,080
and helps you make better decisions

455
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,880
when are you really ready to launch.

456
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,800
Okay. Wonderful.

457
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,400
Doron, tell me what is it like

458
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,840
being the CEO of a company

459
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,840
that's 11 years old, a SAS company.

460
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,320
I mean, how do you dedicate a vision

461
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,880
to a company that's 11 years old.

462
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,040
Where is it at now?

463
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,760
And how has your role as the CEO

464
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,800
transitioned over the years

465
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,120
now that it's profitable

466
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,840
and you're just enjoying it?

467
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,240
Yeah. So, when the company started

468
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,560
remember we started from an idea.

469
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,240
Like we went and raised money

470
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,200
from a PowerPoint

471
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,760
that's basically from a concept.

472
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,440
The ompany today is completely different.

473
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,680
Right.

474
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,960
Way over $100 million in revenue.

475
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,240
It's a profitable company.

476
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,320
We have 500 employees.

477
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,400
Offices in multiple locations worldwide.

478
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,720
So, first of all, it's great to see,

479
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,800
but I think it's very important to know

480
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,840
that vision is something

481
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,320
that evolves over time. Right.

482
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,320
You always need to have a North Star

483
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,440
that you basically go and aspire to be.

484
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,790
So if the beginning it was,

485
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,640
in the wild testing

486
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,360
we wanna be this augmentation staff

487
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:13,030
and then we wanna make sure that

488
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,400
we wanna be a team.

489
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,200
And we wanna make sure that

490
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,320
that all the testing is done.

491
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,240
And now the vision is a true

492
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,030
digital quality platform.

493
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,400
The vision is evolving over time. Right.

494
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,560
As the company matures.

495
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,720
And I think one of the most important

496
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,280
positions and jobs

497
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,920
that the CEO and founder needs to do

498
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,520
is make sure that everybody

499
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,200
is aligned on a vision.

500
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,080
And that basically means

501
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,550
the management team, the employees, the investors,

502
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,440
they're all aligned on a vision.

503
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,680
And from my personal perspective,

504
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,280
as long as it's exciting

505
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,160
and I keep learning

506
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:46,030
and the company's still scaling and growing,

507
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,480
then I'm enjoying myself, right.

508
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,550
And I would say that today

509
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,800
Applause is not the same

510
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,960
than it was a year ago

511
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,560
and it's definitely

512
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,960
not the same than it was 5 years ago.

513
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,040
And as long as that keeps on growing

514
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,480
as a company and doing that

515
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,160
and being the real leader

516
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,830
in the market,

517
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,240
and I enjoy what I am doing.

518
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,760
I love it. Is there still room

519
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,750
for risk taking or

520
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,000
or is there more of an approach

521
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:13,200
of don't fix what ain't broken?

522
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,030
Oh, you gotta take risks.

523
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,520
You gotta take risks.

524
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,280
First of all, I think

525
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,960
at a certain point in time,

526
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,350
some companies actually do the mistake

527
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,310
of stop being innovative

528
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,160
Right.

529
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,030
And I think once you do that

530
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,680
the potential of a spiral roll down

531
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,830
is very very high.

532
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,070
because

533
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,000
once you're successful

534
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:37,640
Once you're successful

535
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,760
you're gonna have competitors

536
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,920
and some of them are good smart people

537
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:44,350
that you kind of paved the path to them

538
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,000
and if you mess it up,

539
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,030
they're gonna take your spot. Right?

540
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,960
So, you've gotta continue to innovate.

541
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,680
And we put every year,

542
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,550
we have what's called Applause Labs.

543
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,800
And that's part of our engineering team.

544
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,560
And all they do is think about new ideas

545
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,750
and new concepts.

546
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,560
And we're rolling out new functionality,

547
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,280
new features, new capabilities,

548
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,550
and new product.

549
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,640
Today you can bring your own team

550
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,400
as part of the Applause platform.

551
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,360
So, let's say you have a team

552
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,030
of business users that you wanna test.

553
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,840
And you have the data

554
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,750
in one location. You can do that

555
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,960
There's many new functionality like

556
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,840
low code no code automation that we're launching

557
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,590
to the market which is

558
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,960
a brand new concept

559
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,310
around automation of software.

560
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,070
So, the company is investing quite a lot

561
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,200
in what would be innovative.

562
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,680
It's very important to also make sure

563
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,480
that the innovation

564
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,280
is around your vision. Right?

565
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,120
You need to continue

566
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:42,480
to strive to your vision

567
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,030
otherwise the forces are not aligned.

568
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,920
And it sounds like a huge responsibility

569
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:50,560
that you're taking being a global leader

570
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,120
and what it means to have quality testing

571
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,320
and quality assurance over products.

572
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,400
And it's almost an innate responsibility

573
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,520
that you're taking on

574
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,720
as you're continuously thinking

575
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,400
what is the next step for quality.

576
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,280
How is the world transitioning to testing,

577
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,520
especially as software is developing.

578
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,160
New languages are coming up.

579
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,200
New technologies are arising constantly.

580
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,030
You know, over the past five years,

581
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,110
IOT has completely exploded.

582
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,800
Now there is gonna be AI models

583
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,160
on device all around us.

584
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,680
And this is gonna bring new challenges

585
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,480
I'm sure to testing. New edge cases

586
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,880
that nobody had thought of.

587
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,760
And you ... this responsibility

588
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,400
of making the leap forward. Right?

589
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:32,680
Yeah, and by the way

590
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,000
those challenges today

591
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,070
exist already, right

592
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,440
I mean, let me give you another,

593
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,830
and better we do all that type of testing.

594
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,110
Let me give you another analogy.

595
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,240
So, you look at Voice, for example.

596
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,790
And you look at the evolution of Voice.

597
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,280
Voice is actually growing much

598
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,680
more than what mobile grew

599
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,270
because of two reasons:

600
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,920
One, it's a natural way for a human

601
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,360
to interact with software.

602
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,320
And two, it's completely

603
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,640
device independent.

604
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,200
It doesn't matter

605
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,680
if you interact with your phone,

606
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,160
or with Android or with IOS

607
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,600
or with your TV,

608
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,480
or with your fridge.

609
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,440
It's a natural way to interact.

610
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
And that's actually growing

611
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,880
exponentially faster than what

612
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,960
mobile apps used to grow.

613
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,520
And that basically means that companies

614
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,480
are investing in voice applications.

615
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,270
Right.

616
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,720
And we do a bunch of testing

617
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,960
around voice applications.

618
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,960
And we work with some

619
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,040
of the infrastructure players

620
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,040
like Amazon and Google around

621
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,640
testing their infrastructure for voice

622
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,600
because Alexa is becoming

623
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,830
more sophisticated. Right?

624
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,080
And there's many other companies

625
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,760
that are investing in voice infrastructure,

626
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,160
and AI and ML infrastructure.

627
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,120
So actually, it's very exciting to be

628
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,920
part of that and help those companies

629
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,960
create a better digital experience

630
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,320
and a better world for all of us.

631
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,550
Very very cool.

632
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,590
Doron, right before we leave,

633
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,720
20 minutes they always end so quick,

634
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,240
but I somehow I feel like

635
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,550
I'm learning so much through this.

636
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,830
So, thank you for your time.

637
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,600
I need three words that you would use

638
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,520
to describe yourself.

639
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,040
And again, thank you for doing this.

640
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,760
You have 500 people that you're managing

641
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,520
across so many different places.

642
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,760
And it's just inspiring to see how

643
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,550
you helped grow this company

644
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,280
from a PowerPoint idea.

645
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,000
Seven years later to this

646
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,240
global leader on quality and testing.

647
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,240
And as an engineer myself, obviously,

648
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,000
I know how critical this is

649
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,680
and how difficult it is to really

650
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,400
feel confident in software that you wrote.

651
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,720
So really incredible to hear

652
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,400
what you guys are doing.

653
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,040
Yes.

654
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,240
So, I'll give you a few words.

655
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,680
So, persistent. Right.

656
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,240
So, be persistent.

657
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,440
Believe.

658
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,160
Okay. As an entrepreneur,

659
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,160
you go through very hard times

660
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,480
and you've gotta believe in your vision

661
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,200
and basically what you're doing.

662
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,560
And lastly, it's love doing.

663
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,280
Right.

664
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,000
You're doing it

665
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,380
not because of money

666
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,480
not because of anything,

667
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,800
you're doing it because you love doing

668
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,720
So, I think these are the three, I would say,

669
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,520
concept that I really love.

670
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,100
I love it. And on the side,

671
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,080
you're still investing right,

672
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,040
in early stage companies,

673
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,200
also through J-Ventures,

674
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,880
but also through,

675
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,680
Are you still sitting

676
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,560
on board seats right now?

677
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,200
I'm actually sitting on a board seat

678
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,000
of a company

679
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,600
which I actually can't announce

680
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,790
because they haven't launched yet.

681
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,350
But it's one of my passions.

682
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,830
So, I actually enjoy biking

683
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,800
and it's a company

684
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,520
that is involved in the biking industry.

685
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,760
So, it's gonna announce

686
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,640
later this summer

687
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,280
and once it's announced

688
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,640
I'll gladly share

689
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,560
But that's that's the only

690
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,000
company I'm on the board of,

691
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,920
other than Applause, of course.

692
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:21,590
Of course.

693
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,440
Doron, toda raba.

694
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,960
Thank you very, very much.

695
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,480
And best of luck with everything.

696
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,280
Thank you for your time.

697
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,520
Thank you. My pleasure.

698
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:28,830
Take care.

699
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,280
Take care.
