1
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
All right.

2
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,640
Ron Schilling, thank you so much

3
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,920
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

4
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,080
Nice to be here.

5
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,280
Great to have you.

6
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,440
You know, you have such a wealth

7
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,680
of experience over 35 years

8
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,520
in the medical imaging technology sector.

9
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,320
You've led incredible achievements

10
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,120
within Toshiba Medical

11
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,640
and General Electric Medical.

12
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,960
Masters at Princeton,

13
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,000
a PhD back in Polytechnic,

14
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,400
now it's NYU.

15
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,600
Ron, give me a brief rundown over

16
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:47,440
of what you've done in this

17
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,960
medical devices technology industry

18
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,720
and I'd love to spend the next 19 minutes

19
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,560
or so learning myself as much as I can

20
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,800
over this industry.

21
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,280
OK, well I started out

22
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,840
at General Electric in the medical field

23
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,960
after having coming

24
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,520
coming out of the semiconductor field.

25
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,480
And GE wanted me for semiconductors

26
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,960
but we didn't make a go of that

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,640
because there was a

28
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,880
a very bad market condition in '74.

29
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,000
In '76, they asked me again

30
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,560
"How about the CAT scanner?"

31
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,000
And I said,

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,320
"Oh my goodness, what is that?"

33
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,280
I asked friends of mine.

34
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:25,760
They said,

35
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,480
"Very high risk but very high reward

36
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:31,880
if it does work properly."

37
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,040
And sure enough, CT became

38
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,080
an incredible reward for all.

39
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:38,480
The thing about it at General Electric was

40
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,960
that the general manager of the business

41
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,440
that I was in, the overall medical business,

42
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,360
had an opportunity to become chairman

43
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,120
of the company

44
00:03:48,121 --> 00:03:50,680
if the CT business did well.

45
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,800
That was Jack Welch,

46
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,040
a very famous name today.

47
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,600
Unfortunately, we lost him about

48
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,360
eight months ago.

49
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,720
And I came in there

50
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,920
and took on the service,

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,360
the marketing organization

52
00:04:03,361 --> 00:04:06,160
for the GE CT program

53
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,080
and I went and spoke to customers

54
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,840
'cause having come

55
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,320
from the semiconductor industry,

56
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,480
you always got out there

57
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,320
to talk to customers.

58
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,040
So, I have a question.

59
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,000
Ron, just paint me a picture.

60
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,280
What year are we?

61
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,200
And I mean, is CT a common thing

62
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,200
around the US at that point?

63
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,360
No, no, no, no.

64
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,320
That was 1976.

65
00:04:24,321 --> 00:04:27,080
CT, was just getting started.

66
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,760
So, and today it's practically

67
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,760
at every hospital, right?

68
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,480
Everywhere you go.

69
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,160
Okay. So, you're really a pioneer

70
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,320
in introducing the CT

71
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,280
to the American market, right?

72
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,200
Right.

73
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,200
So in getting out there

74
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,120
and talking to customers,

75
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,200
they told me that they were very concerned

76
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,960
because this is a new device for them.

77
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,680
Right.

78
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,920
They were used to basic X-ray.

79
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,880
And but what they explained to me was that

80
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,600
CT is about systems,

81
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,600
applications and service,

82
00:04:57,601 --> 00:05:00,880
not just the technology.

83
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,680
So to me, the whole game

84
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,560
was all about quality.

85
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,920
Quality of getting our systems to work

86
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,440
the very best of anyone else's system.

87
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,320
Right.

88
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,040
We may not have had

89
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,800
the very best technology,

90
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:14,640
but because we had

91
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,440
a large organization and x-ray,

92
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,840
we had the best performance

93
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,120
out there in the field.

94
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,760
And we won very big.

95
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,480
We were number one in the United States.

96
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,600
A lot of companies came

97
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,880
into the marketplace.

98
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,520
They went out of the market

99
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,840
leaving the standard

100
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,680
companies working with us.

101
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,960
What was the deciding factor

102
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,200
in helping GE when, aside of course,

103
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,640
you leading the endeavor.

104
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,640
But what were the deciding factors

105
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,400
that made you come on top

106
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,360
versus your competitors

107
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,080
in retrospect?

108
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,960
It was the quality and the images.

109
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,400
It was purely the quality

110
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,360
of the product?

111
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,440
Absolutely.

112
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,680
And we worked very closely with customers.

113
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,000
That was another thing.

114
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,200
We called it the clinical technical tie.

115
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,680
That is, there's a clinical need

116
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,520
and we understand the customers' need

117
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,960
almost as well as they did

118
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,080
because we spoke to many customers.

119
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,760
And clinical technical timings

120
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,240
bring the technology

121
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,240
to the customer situation

122
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,520
and create the right

123
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,720
solution for the right job.

124
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,640
Okay.

125
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,720
So, we had the best brain imaging.

126
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,520
We had the best body imaging.

127
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,160
We had the best knee imaging.

128
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,640
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

129
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,680
We were very applications oriented.

130
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,320
Right.

131
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,920
And that was a very very

132
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,640
important aspect of that,

133
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,160
something that I came away with

134
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
from the semiconductor industry.

135
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,840
Wow.

136
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,440
Then as I moved up

137
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,480
into GE's medical organization,

138
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,920
I was in charge of strategic planning.

139
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,720
And at that time, GE was like

140
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,720
number three in the world.

141
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,400
Wow.

142
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,840
And Jack Welch, again, to become chairman,

143
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,840
wanted us to become

144
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,360
number one in the world.

145
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,520
That was his goal.

146
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,680
And to do that, I looked around,

147
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,120
took some calculations

148
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,840
of the various markets in the world,

149
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,480
and was very clear

150
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,800
that you had to get Japan.

151
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,400
And I looked around in Japan

152
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,760
and I found that Hewlett-Packard,

153
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,360
a company I had a lot of respect for,

154
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,760
already had a partner called Yokogawa.

155
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,480
A very famous group.

156
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,840
Yokogawa Hewlett Packard, YHP.

157
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,560
We became YGE.

158
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:33,280
Yokogawa General Electric.

159
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,880
And we, with Yokogawa,

160
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,600
we became number one

161
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,920
in the Japanese market

162
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:41,160
for a period of time.

163
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,280
Ahead of Toshiba.

164
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,480
Ahead of Hitachi, Shimadzu, etc. etc.

165
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,840
Didn't you go on to work for Toshiba later on?

166
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,600
Didn't you go on

167
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,360
to be a senior vice president

168
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,280
at Toshiba later on?

169
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,160
Yes, absolutely.

170
00:07:56,161 --> 00:07:58,880
Very nice.

171
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:01,800
Well, they knew me.

172
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,120
They knew me very well.

173
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:03,880
Exactly.

174
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,760
But I'll tell you an interesting thing.

175
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,240
While I was fighting them in CT,

176
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,080
I was also their partner

177
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:16,200
in medical equipment

178
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,160
having to do with, what do they call it,

179
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:23,160
cardiac type systems.

180
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:25,680
So, we were already working with them

181
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,440
at that time.

182
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:31,360
So, but in CT, we were enemies.

183
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,160
So, I think it's interesting

184
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,280
how in these huge, huge companies

185
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,080
you could be collaborators

186
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,480
and partners on some fields

187
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,880
but then you have other market aspects

188
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,080
where you're complete competitors

189
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,120
and it's a natural thing, right?

190
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,520
By the way, it took a lot of trust.

191
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,040
I'm sure.

192
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,640
A lot of trust

193
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,520
and no one violated that trust.

194
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,960
Another thing that was very important

195
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,160
in those days to again become the leader

196
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,240
in the world market was

197
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,200
to get a position in China.

198
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,320
And I led a team to China,

199
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,480
and we won to get

200
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,080
the very first whole body scanner

201
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:15,040
into the China market in Beijing hospital.

202
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:15,920
1980.

203
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:19,000
And that was really exciting.

204
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,000
I cannot tell you

205
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,120
because everyone was there for that.

206
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,520
Everyone wanted it.

207
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,720
There were eight companies

208
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,400
and I was asked,

209
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,400
"Do you want to be first or last?"

210
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,360
I said, "I'll be last going in."

211
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,960
Wait, wait, wait. Paint me the picture.

212
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,040
There's eight companies,

213
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,920
pitching to this hospital?

214
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:34,600
Exactly.

215
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,400
Okay, I wanna hear this story.

216
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,160
Tell me this story again.

217
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,160
Well, there were eight

218
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,400
and we came in last.

219
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,960
As in literally you walked last

220
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,680
into the room to show your product.

221
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,680
Well, it was over a period of weeks.

222
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,640
Okay.

223
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,440
We came in to show them

224
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,000
what we could do.

225
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,520
Right.

226
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,840
And at the end of that, they said,

227
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,640
"We wanna go to contract."

228
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:57,960
Wow.

229
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,440
So, I sent my team home.

230
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,040
I worked in the embassy,

231
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,040
the US Embassy in Beijing.

232
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,320
Wow.

233
00:10:06,321 --> 00:10:08,360
Worked up the contracts,

234
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,960
sent the contracts home.

235
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,000
And the team, that was by fax,

236
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,360
if you remember in those days

237
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,920
there was nothing else.

238
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,800
And the team looked at it

239
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,760
and they turned it down.

240
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:22,200
They turned down the deal.

241
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,160
And that's when I made

242
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,760
one of the biggest decisions

243
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,000
of my lifetime.

244
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:29,600
I said "I'm signing this deal anyway"

245
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,840
and I signed it subject to approval

246
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,280
by senior vice president,

247
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,000
Dr. Walter L Robb.

248
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,320
I then went home with the documents,

249
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,600
put it on the table,

250
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,880
and there was the whole senior team.

251
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,360
And Walt Robb looked at the document,

252
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,440
never even looked up

253
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,720
to the other guys at the table,

254
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:50,760
took the pen and signed.

255
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,640
Now, how did I know

256
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,120
that he would probably do that?

257
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,080
We did not communicate.

258
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,200
His boss was Jack Welch.

259
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,680
If Jack Welch found out

260
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,160
that he had in his hands

261
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,960
the opportunity to take China

262
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,000
and he turned it down,

263
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,160
that would not have been a good thing.

264
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,480
Unfortunately, by the way,

265
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,920
both Welch and Walt Robb

266
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,680
passed away over the last year.

267
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:15,360
Two spectacular people.

268
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,800
But I have to ask

269
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,400
Did you think through this

270
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,000
as you were sitting in the embassy

271
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,840
and you were wondering,

272
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:25,120
"Should I go alone in this battle?"

273
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,400
because the outcome could have been,

274
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,200
you come home,

275
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,840
you bring this to the table

276
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,240
and you could get fired.

277
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,880
And you get fired.

278
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:34,120
Yes.

279
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:34,960
You know what?

280
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,600
That would have been worthwhile.

281
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,560
because then I'd make a big deal

282
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,400
in that story.

283
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,600
That's for sure.

284
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,080
No, no, no.

285
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,480
It was obviously,

286
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,760
you got to always look at

287
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:47,600
no matter what little ...

288
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:50,440
What is the right thing to do?

289
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,920
And you have to understand the players

290
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,720
that you're working with,

291
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,320
that you report to.

292
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,040
And it was, that's why I'm saying

293
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,840
it was one of the most

294
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,680
incredible experiences.

295
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,000
On that plane home,

296
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:04,000
I was just so exhilarated about

297
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,520
what that scene was gonna be

298
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,000
when I came in here.

299
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,040
Why did they turn it down?

300
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,520
They turned it down because of the fact

301
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:15,120
that they are very conservative.

302
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,080
They worked for GE all their lives.

303
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:21,160
Taking on the China deal was a major risk.

304
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,480
People and large companies

305
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,200
don't take on large risks.

306
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:24,480
Right.

307
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,480
I'm a semiconductor guy.

308
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,800
I was only around for four to five years.

309
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,600
For me, this is the way we did things

310
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,280
in the semiconductor world.

311
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,320
Right.

312
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,600
Right.

313
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,040
Everything was a risk.

314
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,040
Everything was a risk.

315
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,640
Anyway, that was just terrific.

316
00:12:40,641 --> 00:12:42,200
I then ended up running

317
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,880
the X-ray business at GE.

318
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,080
And then an opportunity came up

319
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,120
in the area of MRI.

320
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,720
And a company called Diasonics

321
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,040
came after me.

322
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,800
Turns out the CEO,

323
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,600
a very close friend of mine

324
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,120
from years back in school,

325
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,520
asked me to run the MRI division

326
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,360
of Diasonics.

327
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,600
They already had X-ray systems

328
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,640
and they had ultrasound.

329
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,200
And that brought me to California.

330
00:13:16,201 --> 00:13:19,760
And it brought me to another program,

331
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,120
by the way that CT scanner

332
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,960
I forgot to mention,

333
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,560
we did the final development at UCSF.

334
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,440
No, you studied

335
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:31,320
your bachelor somewhere else.

336
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,680
GE was in Milwaukee.

337
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,640
Okay.

338
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,000
However, we worked

339
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:38,400
with the main site at UCSF,

340
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,920
also a site in Milwaukee.

341
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:41,240
Okay.

342
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,840
But with Diasonics,

343
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,040
again, I came back to UCSF.

344
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,040
So, you could ... either way.

345
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,960
Yes.

346
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,720
And the research team

347
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:56,120
that we had was from UCSF.

348
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,920
Okay.

349
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,760
Dr. Leon Kauffman and his team

350
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,200
were a group within UCSF

351
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:05,160
that came and worked with us.

352
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,880
And who is my major competitor?

353
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:09,360
GE.

354
00:14:09,361 --> 00:14:11,920
So, when you're at GE,

355
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,560
your biggest competitor was Toshiba.

356
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,200
When you're at Diasonics,

357
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,480
your biggest competitor is GE.

358
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:17,760
Yes.

359
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,920
And when you're in Toshiba,

360
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,040
who is your biggest competitor?

361
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:21,720
The world.

362
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,760
The world.

363
00:14:23,761 --> 00:14:26,320
No. Again, it was GE.

364
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,040
Of course.

365
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:30,120
GE, Siemens and Philips.

366
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,440
And the beautiful thing about

367
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:38,280
the MRI business for us, is that,

368
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,440
I realized we're a small company.

369
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:46,240
If we're a small company, universities

370
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:49,360
are very expensive to work with.

371
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:52,320
So, we can only be very focused

372
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,880
on a few of them.

373
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,000
Then there's the hospital market.

374
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,400
They're much too conservative

375
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,720
to buy from us.

376
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,040
It was, we're a risk for them.

377
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,360
But then there's the private market.

378
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,000
We created the private market.

379
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,640
Those of private docs who feel

380
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,960
MRI is just what they want

381
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,120
and they wanted it for shoulders.

382
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:16,120
They wanted it for hips.

383
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,680
They didn't want to do brain work

384
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,720
like the universities would do.

385
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,440
Right.

386
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,360
And we went after the private market.

387
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,440
And that made us

388
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,280
second in the United States

389
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,920
only to General Electric.

390
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,960
Wow.

391
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,440
It was an incredible situation.

392
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,560
The other thing we did is

393
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,360
we sold them on a paper study basis.

394
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,320
We created that at that time.

395
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,640
So, instead of spending

396
00:15:39,641 --> 00:15:41,200
two or three million dollars

397
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,480
for the whole system,

398
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,200
we put the system in.

399
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:48,080
We had a finance company

400
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,960
work with us on that.

401
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,000
But we made our bread

402
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,040
from the paper study.

403
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,560
Interesting.

404
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:56,920
What does that

405
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,840
mean paper study?

406
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,640
Oh for every study that they do,

407
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,520
they pay us.

408
00:16:01,521 --> 00:16:04,480
Incredible. I love that model.

409
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,520
Yeah.

410
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,480
Well, today it's called subscription.

411
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,800
It's called all kinds of things.

412
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,760
Right.

413
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,680
But back in 1983,

414
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,600
it didn't exist except for us.

415
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,040
Wow.

416
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,480
The other thing that happened,

417
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,800
there's a place,

418
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:20,880
MD Anderson is a very famous center

419
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,440
by the way, located in Texas.

420
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,120
They wanted an MRI.

421
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,600
And we were working with a group

422
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,680
called Texas Medical Equipment.

423
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,280
Another, a player in the private market

424
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:37,080
who had a number of sites.

425
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,920
Our sites.

426
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,840
So, they put in our system into a building

427
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,880
near MD Anderson,

428
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,560
and we then supplied MD Anderson.

429
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,800
The other thing we did is we had vans.

430
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,000
We put a system in a van.

431
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:56,520
We drove that van around the community.

432
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,680
The docs in each of those sites

433
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,040
would have a workstation of ours

434
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,400
inside the hospital.

435
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,000
So, just picture this Michael.

436
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,550
Customer comes into the van.

437
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,920
The imagery is taken.

438
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:14,310
It's sent, streamed. A lot of streaming today.

439
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,070
We were streaming then 1984, 1985.

440
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,790
There was no Internet back then.

441
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,680
Streaming it inside the hospital.

442
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,800
And inside the hospital,

443
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,590
the doctor just went to the workstation,

444
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,070
which is next door to his office.

445
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,320
As far as he was concerned,

446
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,550
the system was in the hospital.

447
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,510
Incredible. Incredible.

448
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,680
It was really incredible.

449
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,440
Ron, we have just a few minutes left

450
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,520
and it's such a unique privilege

451
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,960
to be able to speak to somebody

452
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:42,640
who is really a pioneer

453
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:44,240
in all of these devices.

454
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,550
My girlfriend's father is a radiologist.

455
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,040
So, I'm getting exposed to all these

456
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,640
incredible devices and technology.

457
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,160
And all of a sudden I get to speak

458
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,640
to somebody who helped bring them

459
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,320
to market back in the day.

460
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,070
And I'd love to get your input.

461
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,440
What earned secrets

462
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,960
or what insight do you have

463
00:18:01,961 --> 00:18:04,600
from your impressive career

464
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,310
over the last 35 years in this industry?

465
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,840
What can I take away

466
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,120
as a young entrepreneur

467
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,480
from your experiences?

468
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,320
Well the first thing is vision

469
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:18,520
and an example of a vision is,

470
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,280
when I saw the opportunity

471
00:18:21,281 --> 00:18:23,920
to instead of having flat images,

472
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:27,920
have images in open 3D space

473
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,400
where the doctor can interact

474
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,510
with the object.

475
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,080
Just think about swimming

476
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,160
through your brain,

477
00:18:35,161 --> 00:18:37,960
as opposed to being only able to see

478
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,400
a flat image of your brain.

479
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,790
It makes all the difference in the world.

480
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,200
Having that kind of a vision

481
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,320
got us into something

482
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,350
called "interactive mixed reality"

483
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,200
Now becoming a very big thing.

484
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,920
We've been at it

485
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,200
for five or six years already.

486
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,200
The other thing is

487
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:59,070
being a dot collector, a connector.

488
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,030
What is a dot connector?

489
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,270
Well, there's radiology, there's surgery

490
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,120
and realizing that radiology

491
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,960
and surgery need to come together.

492
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,040
So, when we showed them

493
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,720
this open 3D space imaging

494
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,790
and a radiologist said,

495
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,960
"Oh, with this I can speak intelligently

496
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,310
to a surgeon."

497
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,800
And then a surgeon said,

498
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,550
just a minute later,

499
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,120
"Wow.

500
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,000
I've never used a workstation before."

501
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,310
I said, "Why not?"

502
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:25,600
He said,

503
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,160
"I've never opened up a patient

504
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,880
and seen a 2D view."

505
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,920
Right.

506
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,070
Right? Everything's 3D in surgery.

507
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,310
Yeah.

508
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,360
So, our technology was the bridge

509
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,310
between radiology and surgery.

510
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:36,750
Wow.

511
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,110
We've given so many papers on that

512
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,440
and that's why we're leading

513
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,960
in that whole area.

514
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:46,400
And the last point, is being a coach.

515
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,040
Being a director coach, I think,

516
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:53,070
is my life from now on.

517
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,400
And I'm already involved

518
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,750
in a number of startups

519
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,720
which we utilized the technology

520
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,320
from the company Echo Pixel,

521
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:02,520
where they're looking things

522
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,310
in open 3D space.

523
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,830
One is scoliosis.

524
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,200
You have to use three dimensions

525
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,590
in scoliosis.

526
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,120
And the reason they have so many problems

527
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,070
is because they use two dimensional views.

528
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,400
And things like that.

529
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,070
Right.

530
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,160
So, those are the aspects

531
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,880
that I think are all very important:

532
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,880
vision,

533
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,550
being a dot connector,

534
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,640
and being a coach.

535
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,240
Ron, are those the three words

536
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,800
that you would choose also for yourself?

537
00:20:27,801 --> 00:20:30,030
Of how you would describe yourself?

538
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,310
Oh absolutely.

539
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,310
I love it.

540
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,160
I'm always looking for dots.

541
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,070
So visionary, dot connector,

542
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,590
and the last one?

543
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,200
And the last one is coach.

544
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,280
The last one is coach.

545
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,840
Ron, I wanna take this opportunity

546
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,400
to thank you again for your generous time.

547
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,200
Inspiring to hear how you helped

548
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,400
lead this industry.

549
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,040
And I think it's just so much fun

550
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,800
that you got to work

551
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:53,800
with all these different companies

552
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,000
who ended up being competitors

553
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,350
to each other and the world.

554
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,040
Yet, you always came out on top.

555
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,160
So, I think that shows quite a bit about

556
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,880
the visionary, the dot connectedness,

557
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,830
and the coach that you bring with you.

558
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,680
Thank you very much.

559
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,120
I wanted to get to talk also

560
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,240
about you're very involved

561
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,000
with J-Ventures that we're both at

562
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,310
but we didn't get to that.

563
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:13,820
But definitely,

564
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,040
it's great to have you there

565
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,040
and I love learning from you all the time

566
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,960
through all the work we do there.

567
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,830
So, thank you again and have a great day.

568
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,750
Have a great day and stay healthy.

569
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,110
