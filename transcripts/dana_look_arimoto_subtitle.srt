1
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,280
Dana Look-Arimoto thank you so much

2
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,560
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,280
How are you?

4
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,840
Great. Thank you for asking.

5
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,280
It's been quite a whirlwind, 2020.

6
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,040
We were supposed to do this last week

7
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,200
when the fires broke out in California.

8
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,280
So, just as we thought we've seen it all,

9
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,280
it looks like

10
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,560
there's a little bit more coming.

11
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,760
But  we're doing it.

12
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,400
So, I'm very thankful

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,560
for being so generous with your time

14
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,920
and for being so flexible.

15
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,080
Sure.

16
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,840
To start off, you have four dogs.

17
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,640
Among them, 15 legs,

18
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,920
only three of them can hear.

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,560
Tell me a little bit

20
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,360
about your rescue dogs.

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,280
Well, they're rescue.

22
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,800
So, like all of us,

23
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,440
they are differently abled.

24
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,760
One has three legs, one can't hear.

25
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,880
And we love them all.

26
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,680
I love it. What are their names?

27
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:09,760
Leo, Leilani, Scooter and Lily.

28
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,120
Oh, I love it. Very very cute.

29
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,800
Wonderful. Okay.

30
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,040
So, Dana, before we get to talk

31
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,800
about some of the topics that we discussed

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,440
that I think are going to be fascinating,

33
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,360
whether it's about gender equality

34
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,120
or work-life balance,

35
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,000
I'd love to hear a little bit

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,520
about your journey because you've done

37
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,920
so many different things

38
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,920
from being in advisory boards,

39
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,040
to creating organizations,

40
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,960
to now coaching leadership

41
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,400
to different leaders

42
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,600
and leadership styles

43
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,320
to speaking engagements.

44
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,400
So, who are you?

45
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,040
And what motivates you?

46
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,200
I am clearly someone with ADD

47
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,600
and someone who likes to experiment.

48
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,920
And I'm definitely motivated and inspired

49
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,000
by making an impact on the world.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,640
And so, in a lot of ways,

51
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,640
having hired and trained, develop,

52
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,920
mentored thousands of people

53
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,000
over 20 some years,

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,880
primarily in Silicon Valley,

55
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,040
I feel like I can honestly say,

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,960
I have made a difference, however,

57
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,120
I have a real impatience for action,

58
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,640
which is also very Silicon Valley.

59
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,360
And so, I would like to help

60
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,040
more people universally.

61
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,480
And that's the mission I'm on now.

62
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,120
What is that?

63
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,000
So, what does that even mean,

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,640
that you're coaching and helping people,

65
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,760
whether it's in Silicon Valley

66
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,280
or elsewhere, but what does that mean

67
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,400
for you to help make an impact

68
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,680
by helping others?

69
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,880
Yeah. So, one of the reasons

70
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,960
I dabble in so many

71
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,760
different methods and mediums,

72
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,920
having a book now and a podcast;

73
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,200
and posting on Instagram;

74
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,920
and having a full executive

75
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,760
coaching practice

76
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,840
with C-Suite members

77
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,280
of different kinds of companies,

78
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,560
including founder led companies,

79
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,720
it gives me a chance to really work

80
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,160
in different ways with different people.

81
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,080
Some short term, some long term,

82
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,920
some quick hit,

83
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,440
some really over horizon work

84
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,520
and strategy, so I have

85
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,360
all these different vantage points

86
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,800
of working with individuals

87
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,480
and helping them

88
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,360
with where they want to go.

89
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,760
So, you're looking at all these

90
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,840
hundreds or thousands of people

91
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,640
that you're saying,

92
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,960
"Give me some things that often come up?"

93
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,920
What are some things that oftentimes

94
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,560
you see pattern recognition

95
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,120
and you're saying,

96
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,360
ah, I've seen this before;

97
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,560
I'm seeing this type of behavior;

98
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,640
I'm seeing this type of thing

99
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,800
that maybe if I look at that case study,

100
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,400
I can bring that in and help?

101
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,440
For sure. So, people confuse

102
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,840
management with leadership

103
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,440
every single day.

104
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,280
And there's a clear

105
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,480
and distinct difference,

106
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,000
and I'm really interested

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,520
in helping people with leadership

108
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,360
whether they're the leader of their life;

109
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,520
the leader at work;

110
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,880
the leader in their marriage;

111
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,080
the leader in their career;

112
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,480
they're leader in their education;

113
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,320
I really am interested

114
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,880
in helping people lead.

115
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,440
And so, you've mentioned that book

116
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,080
that you've written.

117
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,080
So, tell me a little bit about that

118
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,880
and how that ties into this work

119
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,400
with mentorship and coaching.

120
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,440
Yeah. So, I hit my head pretty hard

121
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,760
many times, and I guess I'm a slow learner

122
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,320
in terms of work-life balance

123
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,720
and believing I can have it all

124
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,400
by doing it all, all at one time.

125
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,080
And of course, women in particular,

126
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,840
in Silicon Valley,

127
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,480
we have all these great muses

128
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,320
who make it look like that's possible.

129
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,560
Well, the truth is, it's not.

130
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,120
We actually all have limits.

131
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,360
And without serious help,

132
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,120
serious outsourcing,

133
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,320
serious financial wherewithal, etc, etc,

134
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,640
it's really not possible to have it all

135
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,640
all at one time.

136
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,440
And so, what I've really learned

137
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
and proven over time

138
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,320
and now I'm helping others

139
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,720
to figure out for themselves

140
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,720
and their organizations is that

141
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,000
you have to give something up

142
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,720
to get what it is you really want.

143
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,880
And most people don't even ask themselves,

144
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,200
what is it I really want

145
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,680
situationally and relatively.

146
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,600
Right. So, I mean, when every time,

147
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
like we say, work life-balance,

148
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,200
immediately, the 21st century

149
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,720
has given rise to this idea

150
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,560
of work life-balance.

151
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,480
And a lot of different people

152
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,600
are talking about it.

153
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,680
Throughout high school,

154
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,560
the mantra that my principal had

155
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,680
was balance, balance, balance.

156
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,000
Everybody's talking about balance.

157
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,400
As a go getter myself,

158
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,920
I can justify there's 24 hours in a day,

159
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,640
sometimes I feel like any minute

160
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,560
that I'm doing something,

161
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,680
I feel like I'm missing out

162
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,600
on that other thing.

163
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,880
Talk to me a little bit about your take

164
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,920
on this work-life balance.

165
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,080
What does it take to really succeed?

166
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,880
And what does it mean

167
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,080
to be authentic enough with yourself

168
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,480
to be able to forgo some other things

169
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,080
that maybe the social norm

170
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,360
won't really let you?

171
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,760
Yeah. So, the social norm

172
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,600
is a big part of it.

173
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
I'm glad you brought that up.

174
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,160
So, there's these should:

175
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,000
you should do this,

176
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,440
you shouldn't do that.

177
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,000
And someone also might be

178
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,720
someone you emulate or your muse

179
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,640
or you're a role model or your mentor

180
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,200
and you think,

181
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,280
"Oh, they do it this way,

182
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,360
so, I should too."

183
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,320
Well, one size never fits all.

184
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,680
One size only fits one.

185
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,400
So, there's five key areas of life

186
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,880
that we all share universally

187
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,440
and they are:

188
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,920
career, family, friendships,

189
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,640
community and your own well-being.

190
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,960
And so, what happens

191
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,440
when you're constantly running

192
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,720
like a hamster,

193
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,040
sprinting inside of a marathon

194
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,720
in this wheel, on this teeter totter,

195
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,000
you might hit balance for a moment,

196
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,120
but it comes with a really high cost.

197
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,560
And then you're usually depleted,

198
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,400
exhausted, sick in some cases,

199
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,800
like I talk about in my book,

200
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,240
and you roll out of the wheel

201
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,160
and then you hit reset

202
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,400
and you get right back in the wheel.

203
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,120
We don't do anything different.

204
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,600
And then, you just start running.

205
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,160
It sounds like you were alluding

206
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,360
to some specific example

207
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,200
that I'd love to hear.

208
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,240
Sure. I used to get pneumonia

209
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,280
one to three times per year.

210
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,680
Pneumonia, one to three times per year.

211
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,800
Yeah. Like clockwork.

212
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,640
Really?

213
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,920
Pattern recognition.

214
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,920
Predictably, I would know

215
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,040
it was coming and still working.

216
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,080
So, it was seasonal

217
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,690
based on how much work you had.

218
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,880
Yeah.

219
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,680
And so, okay.

220
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,920
So, tell me about this experience.

221
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,960
You are getting pneumonia seasonally

222
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,080
two or three times a year,

223
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,840
you realize that it's part of your work,

224
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,440
I'm guessing that

225
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,800
you are still working very hard.

226
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
You're allowing yourself

227
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,400
to get pneumonia

228
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,680
for quite some time, right?

229
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,440
Yes. Years. Years and years.

230
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,760
It's like this total type-A overachiever.

231
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,320
Single mom at the time,

232
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,280
really thought I was striving

233
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,280
for something, not realizing,

234
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,720
and it's a little corny,

235
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,040
but it is the journey

236
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,720
it's not the destination.

237
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,160
And if you are someone

238
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,360
who's very motivated, very high achieving,

239
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,920
you know there's no destination.

240
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,840
Because there's another mountain

241
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,920
to climb anyway.

242
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,400
Right.

243
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,200
And no one says,

244
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,240
"Let me sprint the marathon."

245
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,080
and then they win.

246
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,440
100%. I remember vividly my family

247
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,760
and we were climbing

248
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,840
Mount Kilimanjaro last year

249
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,360
and it was one of the hardest things

250
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,240
I've ever done in my life.

251
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,960
And as we reach the peak,

252
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,080
we were telling ourselves

253
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,760
the entire eight days,

254
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,920
"There's no way we're ever doing

255
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,480
this thing again."

256
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,280
"This is awful."

257
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,760
"We're in so much pain."

258
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,120
The second we hit the bus down

259
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,480
at the bottom of the mountain, we're like,

260
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,080
"Okay. So, Everest next year?"

261
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,920
like, what's happening?

262
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,440
So, covid hit.

263
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,680
So, maybe that's one of the reasons

264
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,480
why we didn't go for that.

265
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,040
But I can totally feel what you're saying.

266
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,160
So, now that you're helping others

267
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,040
understand this through the book,

268
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,440
what are you saying then?

269
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,280
So, what is the solution?

270
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,200
Because I know for myself

271
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,040
I will not be satisfied if I do less work.

272
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,800
All things are not created equal.

273
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,200
So, what I suggest is that

274
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,480
you actually choose

275
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,560
what you want to work on,

276
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,920
what you want to spend time on.

277
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,240
And the derivative,

278
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,640
the delta of the equation

279
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,720
is joy, productivity and value.

280
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,120
So, if I say to you,

281
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,280
you can have all three,

282
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,760
that's your triple threat,

283
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,600
joy, productivity and value.

284
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,400
But you can't do all things equally

285
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,520
at all times on any given day,

286
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,960
especially inside of a week.

287
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,160
I really encourage you to look

288
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,080
at your week's production,

289
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,400
168 hours in a week.

290
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,040
We all have the same amount of time.

291
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,400
You can't buy more,

292
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
then you might think differently about,

293
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,520
Okay, do I want to spend

294
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,600
more time in career,

295
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,200
more time with family,

296
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,840
are career and family my top,

297
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,600
and then I'm willing

298
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,760
to trade off a little bit

299
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,000
on community and maybe friendships.

300
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,360
But what about your wellbeing?

301
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,040
What about you

302
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,400
and taking care of yourself?

303
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,760
Because when we come last,

304
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,960
there's nothing to give.

305
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,760
Right. Right.

306
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,920
So then, I mean, these are definitely

307
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,640
not things that we can do alone, right?

308
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,760
I mean, I don't think that I could

309
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,600
really be honest with myself sitting down

310
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,800
because there's so many different pulls

311
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,480
and so many different things

312
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,280
that bring you into a different area.

313
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,680
So how do people go about that?

314
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,920
So, I have a free quiz

315
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,840
on settlesmarter.com/quiz,

316
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,720
and it gives you at least a very quick,

317
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,080
very simple five minutes or less baseline

318
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,880
as to where you are when

319
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,120
when no one else is looking.

320
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,280
So, you take this quiz.

321
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,920
It can be anonymous.

322
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,640
It doesn't have to be,

323
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,520
but it's not going to get shared

324
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,760
with anyone but yourself.

325
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,000
And so, depending on how explicit you are

326
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,400
with yourself, you figure out

327
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,720
where am I actually spending time

328
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,600
versus where do I really want

329
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,280
to spend time.

330
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,600
So, the quiz forces you to make decisions

331
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,400
and trade offs and then it gives you

332
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,680
a little bit of like a spider graph

333
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,760
of where you're at

334
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,160
versus where you want to be at.

335
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,760
And then there's some tips and tricks

336
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,080
and tools and traps to avoid

337
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,560
on how to get there.

338
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,120
Definitely.

339
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,480
Definitely.

340
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,240
So, what patterns have you been seeing,

341
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,920
at least with the work that you're doing

342
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
in terms of people's ability

343
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,000
to find his balance

344
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,760
or if it's helping their work

345
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,800
or it's hindering the work?

346
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,440
Because obviously,

347
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,160
there's so much connectivity here

348
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,080
with their inner well-being,

349
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,000
their physical health,

350
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,800
with the work they're doing.

351
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,520
How does it all come together?

352
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,400
Yeah. I like to say harmony

353
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,880
beats balance every time,

354
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,400
and harmony is what you get

355
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,480
when you integrate.

356
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,560
It's when we compartmentalize

357
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,640
or separate ourselves

358
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,800
or pretend we're one person at one work

359
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,360
and one person at home.

360
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,400
And especially in covid,

361
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
we all see everyone all the time.

362
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,880
It's not like I don't see your kitchen

363
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,600
behind you right now, I do.

364
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,120
And it's not like you don't see my son

365
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,360
that I forgot to put away.

366
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,520
And if you saw a little lower my camera,

367
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:30,800
you'd be like,

368
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,120
"Oh, your credentials are on the ground."

369
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,560
Well, that's because my social media,

370
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,680
I'd take them off the wall

371
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,520
and I have flowers,

372
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,960
but I wouldn't normally have flowers.

373
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,480
So, we're just revealed

374
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,800
we're just ourselves.

375
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,640
We're just human.

376
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,640
And so when we stop

377
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,000
compartmentalizing so much

378
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,240
and we start making

379
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,680
those conscious trade offs,

380
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,000
things start to really shift for us

381
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,920
and we can really feel that joy,

382
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,680
productivity and value.

383
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,240
So, now you were saying

384
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,480
like we're entering new reality

385
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,680
of where it's not even work-life balance,

386
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,720
but the line between life and work

387
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,520
is so blurred that in one moment,

388
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,760
I'm sitting here and like you said,

389
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,720
if we look at the camera

390
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,240
a little bit there,

391
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,120
I have my dog sitting right next to me.

392
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,800
And It's playtime in about five minutes

393
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,920
when this is over.

394
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,840
So, how do we balance this whole arena?

395
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,360
We talk about it.

396
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,640
And I would say to you,

397
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,600
"What are you going to play

398
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,240
with your dog?"

399
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,360
"Oh, I'd love to see your dog."

400
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:18,800
And you say,

401
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,640
"Oh, can you bring

402
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,520
your four dogs in here?"

403
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,600
Probably not, because it'd be total chaos.

404
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,360
But I mean, even on social media,

405
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,640
I'm starting to put my dogs

406
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,600
in the shot with me

407
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,640
because why not let people

408
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,920
really see who I am and what I care about.

409
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,480
And that's where rapport building

410
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,920
and mirroring an alignment

411
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,600
and fully understand each other comes from

412
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,640
is finding something of commonality.

413
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,080
This is what the number one thing

414
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,680
is in dealing with gender issues,

415
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,720
with dealing with diversity,

416
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,760
equity and inclusion issues,

417
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,240
find something in common.

418
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,080
Like if you were wearing glasses right now

419
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,360
and I'm wearing glasses right now,

420
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,960
we could say we both have glasses.

421
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,720
Who cares that you're younger than I am,

422
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,320
and a guy.

423
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,880
And I'm older than you are, and a woman.

424
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,480
Who cares?

425
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,440
We both have glasses.

426
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,240
You don't have glasses.

427
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,640
So, that fell apart there,

428
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,280
but you know what I mean.

429
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,840
Not yet. It's going to happen

430
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,960
sooner rather than later.

431
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,040
But you're mentioning

432
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,320
gender equality or inequality

433
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,120
and diversification.

434
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,800
Give me your two cents

435
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,800
on both those subjects.

436
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,080
First, seek to understand

437
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,840
before seeking to be understood.

438
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,440
That's it. It solves everything.

439
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,320
Clarify a little bit.

440
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,400
What do you mean by that?

441
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,360
Have you heard of the Golden Rule?

442
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,480
I have.

443
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,640
And I've heard of the platinum rule,

444
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,680
which I believe you're going to allude to.

445
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,920
Right?

446
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,920
I thought I invented the platinum rule.

447
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,040
I can't prove it.

448
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,640
But I put that into place

449
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,440
in my company in 1999.

450
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,600
And you were probably

451
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,040
way better at research than I am.

452
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,480
So, I'm going to actually ask you

453
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,840
to trade me this back and tell me,

454
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,680
did that come out before '99?

455
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,120
If not, I missed the boat.

456
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,270
I should have coined that.

457
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:50,450
Yeah, go ahead.

458
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,800
No no. What is the golden rule

459
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,520
and the platinum rule?

460
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,160
The golden rule,

461
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,720
which comes apparently from the Bible,

462
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,240
I'm spiritual, not religious, however,

463
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,440
the golden rule is:

464
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,440
Do unto others

465
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,720
as you'd have done unto you.

466
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,960
The platinum rule is:

467
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,680
Do unto others

468
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,280
as they'd have done onto them.

469
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,320
If you don't know what somebody wants,

470
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,720
you need to understand it,

471
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,280
before you try to get them

472
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,120
to see it your way.

473
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,680
And because we're talking Silicon Valley

474
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,000
and everything agile,

475
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,120
I will add the equation for speed

476
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,920
and enhancement of performance is:

477
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,440
One plus one equals three.

478
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,800
That's the collaborative model which is

479
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,320
your ideas and experience and mine together

480
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,000
are moving us further faster.

481
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Right.

482
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,520
That's how collaboration works.

483
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,560
But if I were to just really

484
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,160
try to push my agenda on you,

485
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
that's the Golden Rule.

486
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,640
So, as you're talking to leaders,

487
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,240
C-Suite executives,

488
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,360
how do you help them cope

489
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,640
with this new era?

490
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,120
Obviously, 2020 gave life

491
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,800
to a lot of issues that are present

492
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
not just in United States,

493
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,200
but in the world in general.

494
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,440
The Me too movement

495
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,760
over the past few years,

496
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,160
the Black Lives Matter movement.

497
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,440
So, what's happening now

498
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,200
as you're observing

499
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,000
with the leadership scene?

500
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,840
And what are some practical things

501
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,760
that as a leader myself or

502
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,120
my friends or anybody else

503
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,960
who wants to become a good leader,

504
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,000
what can we do to improve?

505
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,440
So, the first thing is something

506
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,480
that I'm leading by example on, again,

507
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,880
because I firmly believe

508
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,720
and I can prove it,

509
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,040
that people follow what you do,

510
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,280
not what you say.

511
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,480
So, I don't do diversity,

512
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,000
equity and inclusion training anymore.

513
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,440
I'm white and I don't do it.

514
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,960
I refer it to people of color, some women,

515
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,680
some men, but people of color

516
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,920
because it's very hard

517
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,080
to coach or teach anything

518
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,160
where you can't possibly walk

519
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,800
in those shoes.

520
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,840
I mean, look, we're all in the same storm,

521
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,040
but we're definitely in different boats.

522
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,480
And you cannot ever assume

523
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,720
you can relate to someone

524
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,560
or step in their shoes

525
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,400
or be where they've been if you haven't.

526
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,280
And it's a really slippery slope.

527
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,280
So, for leaders in particular,

528
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,920
I had a client this morning say,

529
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,440
"We'd love you to do DE and I work."

530
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:02,760
And I said,

531
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,960
"No, I'm white. I'm not doing it."

532
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,040
"But here's a couple of people

533
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,440
to choose from. You pick."

534
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,680
"But I love all of them

535
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,120
that I'm referring you to."

536
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,280
And most of these particular leaders

537
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,520
and I'm thinking about recently

538
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,720
are also white.

539
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,000
And it's sometimes a little bit

540
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,160
of an eye opener, they're like,

541
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,000
"But I don't understand?"

542
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,840
"Like you are a coach."

543
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,040
"Why wouldn't you do that work?"

544
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,160
And you're a woman,

545
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,680
it's like I'm a white woman of privilege.

546
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,200
Whether I've earned it or not,

547
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,320
it doesn't matter.

548
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,280
And so, I think it's really time

549
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,680
to really raise this bar.

550
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,760
And that means we have to do something.

551
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,680
And that's my something.

552
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,200
I love it.

553
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,800
That is very very inspiring.

554
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,720
So, I love to spend the last few minutes

555
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,040
that we have to get to know you

556
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,600
a little bit better.

557
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,680
And what really motivates you?

558
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,960
Because over the years,

559
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,560
having done so much and being so in tune

560
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,120
with the things that make you happy

561
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,440
and helping others achieve

562
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,800
that fulfillment and understanding

563
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,840
of where their joy, productivity

564
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,840
and balance in life

565
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,200
So, what are you

566
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,360
really get excited about?

567
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,920
Helping others

568
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,640
that want to change the world.

569
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,200
So that I'm not feeling so much

570
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,560
like I'm doing a lot of this on my own.

571
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,320
It's too slow.

572
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,200
And you also mentioned

573
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,200
that you are a little ADHD with it,

574
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,600
with the fact that

575
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,560
you're a little impatient

576
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,840
to wait for it to happen, right?

577
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,160
Always.

578
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,360
So, how does that come into play?

579
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,360
So, do you work

580
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,400
with a lot of different people

581
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,720
so that you can experience

582
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,880
a lot of different journeys?

583
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,840
And by the time you move on

584
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,440
to the next journey,

585
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,680
the first one will have caught up

586
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,360
and got to work?

587
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,360
That's a great question. Yeah.

588
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,120
There's also a spectrum I've identified.

589
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,880
I've actually have this

590
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,280
self named protocol about how I coach.

591
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,560
There's a guide process

592
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,520
and involve process and a master process.

593
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,880
Because your life is a gem

594
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,080
and it's multifaceted and that's G-E-M.

595
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,680
And some people

596
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,920
pace through the guide piece,

597
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,240
which is training wheels

598
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,160
really really fast.

599
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,800
Others, it can be years.

600
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,920
Some people get through like,

601
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,600
Ah, I'm wobbly,

602
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,760
but the training wheels are off.

603
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,320
That's the evolve process really fast.

604
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,080
Others are years.

605
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,320
Master is,

606
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,400
I'm an autopilot

607
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,320
and I no longer have to think about,

608
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,600
oh, I'm going to turn left

609
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,440
I pushed the blinker down on the car.

610
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,480
And that's where I want everyone to get.

611
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,280
And then they've probably outgrown me

612
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,880
or they can just check in occasionally

613
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,040
for maintenance or whatever.

614
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,080
And I'm cool with that.

615
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,640
And not all coaches are cool with that.

616
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,000
I don't need to coach people for life.

617
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,640
What does that mean to coach?

618
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,200
So, let's go back a little bit

619
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,880
and go up 30,000 feet in the air.

620
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,080
Why do executives and leaders

621
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,040
need a coach?

622
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,240
Because the average person

623
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,320
thinks of a leader, a big time CEO,

624
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,920
we're thinking politicians,

625
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,240
"They have it together."

626
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,080
"They know everything."

627
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,800
"They're moral."

628
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,240
"They know exactly what needs to happen."

629
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,360
But it's not always the case, is it?

630
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,880
No. And it certainly wasn't for me

631
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,280
when I hired my first coach,

632
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,200
which was when I was

633
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,160
helping a founder grow

634
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,080
and exit her business.

635
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,000
Two heads are always better than one.

636
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,520
I've always found that to be true.

637
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,680
No one knows everything about anything.

638
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,520
And the sounding board,

639
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,360
even if you have

640
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,200
a fantastic board of directors,

641
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
sometimes you just need to vent.

642
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,520
You need structured venting.

643
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,200
And you need a sounding board

644
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,360
who then may help you

645
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,160
get back to solutions and options.

646
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,600
So, I am an avid believer

647
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,320
and not just because

648
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,400
that's what I do for a living.

649
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,960
I had a very serious coach,

650
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,840
in my last company

651
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,360
before I defected from corporate America.

652
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,480
Is it difficult sometimes for leaders

653
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,240
to hire a coach and to start the process,

654
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,960
feeling that they're maybe giving up

655
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,360
some of that ego or control

656
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,440
that they had before

657
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,320
or they thought they had?

658
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,640
That's a really good question.

659
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,200
Yes. And I'm really clear.

660
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,480
I do what's called a fit call

661
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,720
before I coach anyone.

662
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,800
It has to be mutual.

663
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,000
We have to be on the same page.

664
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,440
And if you're not self-aware

665
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,920
and if you don't want to shift

666
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,160
and you don't want to transform

667
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,400
in an accelerated way,

668
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,120
I am absolutely not the coach for you.

669
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,720
I'm all for healthy ego.

670
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,520
but super inflated ego,

671
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,920
I'm a pretty tough coach with.

672
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,360
I'm pretty good

673
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,800
at getting that back in check.

674
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,760
Fragile ego, I don't coach people

675
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,120
with fragile egos. It's just not my line.

676
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,600
What does that mean fragile ego?

677
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,080
Sometimes it's a victim thing;

678
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,480
it's a super hypercritical thing;

679
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,120
it's poor me,

680
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,320
look what the world's done to me;

681
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,920
but here I am with this pile of money

682
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,920
and our big title,

683
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,360
like, I don't have the patience for it.

684
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,560
Yeah, I'm also a mom.

685
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,240
So, that's the mom card.

686
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,800
I love it.

687
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,320
I love it.

688
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,800
Okay. Dana, before we leave,

689
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,040
I want to thank you again, first of all,

690
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,200
for being so generous with your time

691
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,160
and being so flexible

692
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,960
with all that's happened.

693
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,720
This is definitely

694
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,720
very very insightful and very interesting

695
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,480
both talking about the work life-balance

696
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,560
and mainly, I'm taking from this

697
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,760
being honest with yourself.

698
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,920
And it's difficult to raise

699
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,440
and especially coming in at Stanford

700
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,480
and in Silicon Valley,

701
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,640
there's so much happening

702
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,240
and there's certainly

703
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,000
different opportunities,

704
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,280
And it's very easy to lose track

705
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,800
that there's only 24 hours in the day

706
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,040
and it might make sense

707
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,720
to even spend

708
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,160
five or six hours of them sleeping.

709
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,760
My girlfriend definitely is, we're having

710
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,800
our daily struggles with that

711
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,000
and she needs to win more often.

712
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,720
But before we leave,

713
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,840
I have to ask you for three words

714
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,080
that you would use to describe yourself

715
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,800
and why those three words.

716
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
You won't be surprised.

717
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,520
Tenacious, impatient

718
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,640
and universally minded.

719
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,440
I love it.

720
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,440
Why those three?

721
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,760
I've always been known

722
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,480
even in my last two companies ago,

723
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,840
Global Group I was running,

724
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,320
they called me "Tenacious D"

725
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,640
because I just will not give up.

726
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,160
I am such a firm believer

727
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,280
that if something needs to be done,

728
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,240
I'll get it done.

729
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,440
It doesn't matter if it's a mountain

730
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,720
that needs to be moved, or a hill.

731
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,040
If I believe it, I'll do it.

732
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,300
If I don't believe it, I also won't do it

733
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,840
as I enter my early 50s here.

734
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,400
I won't do it if I don't believe it.

735
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,440
And that's new for me.

736
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,360
I used to do things

737
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,200
I didn't believe in

738
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,160
because I thought I was holding

739
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,440
the company line or whatever,

740
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,560
but not anymore.

741
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,400
I just will only do what I believe in

742
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,080
and I'm going to do it

743
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,320
with a lot of tenacity.

744
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,960
I love it. And I have other two.

745
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,240
Two more words

746
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,760
that I need explanation for.

747
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,280
Impatience, it's probably the ADD.

748
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,320
It's probably a little bit

749
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,400
of Silicon Valley and also boredom.

750
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,760
Frankly, my mind works fast

751
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,120
and so I get bored

752
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,880
and that's usually not good.

753
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,000
And finally, the last word.

754
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,280
Yeah. Universally minded since I was born.

755
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,680
I mean, as long as I can remember,

756
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,560
I've been crusading,

757
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,480
fighting for the underdog, causes.

758
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
Kind of grew up that way in Wisconsin

759
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,480
where I was raised

760
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,360
before I came out here

761
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,160
to the great Bay Area.

762
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,440
And I do believe

763
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,280
that we can make a dent

764
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,960
in the universe

765
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,800
and do good.

766
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,040
I do believe in being socially conscious.

767
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,320
100%. It sounds like

768
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,360
that's exactly what you're doing,

769
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,120
whether it's by helping others

770
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,960
achieve that or by spreading your message.

771
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,080
And I definitely hope

772
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,360
that this will also help

773
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,520
being insightful for others.

774
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,560
It definitely was for me.

775
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,040
Thank you very much again

776
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,840
for being so generous with your time.

777
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,680
And stay safe and stay healthy.

778
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,520
Same to you and your listeners.

779
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,840
Thank you.

780
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,000
Take care.
