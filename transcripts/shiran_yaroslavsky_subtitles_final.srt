1
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,600
Shiran Yaroslavsky, how are you?

2
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,120
Good good. How are you doing?

3
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,360
I am fantastic.

4
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,480
But first I want to hear

5
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,360
you're just around

6
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,320
you said Yellowstone,

7
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,400
making your way to Oregon

8
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,400
with a laptop on your back in your bag

9
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,440
as a digital nomad

10
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,000
for the next couple of weeks, right?

11
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,760
Yeah, yeah.

12
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,560
So my story is,

13
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,320
just for a bit of background,

14
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,560
I relocated to the US in last November.

15
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,320
And I was planning to explore the US,

16
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,800
and then covid hit us

17
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,880
and everything is in lock down.

18
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,240
And I live in the Bay Area.

19
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,360
So I'm waiting for my hairdresser

20
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,320
for five months now.

21
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,280
So, I'm like, we were working from home

22
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,920
and we're working for so many hours.

23
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,960
And we just decided,

24
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
my husband and me,

25
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,680
just to pack our stuff

26
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,960
and just go and explore the US a bit.

27
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,720
So, I'm now working a lot,

28
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,440
but also had the pleasure

29
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,080
to enjoy Yellowstone,

30
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,840
or Grand Teton, now Oregon.

31
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,600
So how does it work?

32
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,560
Do you actually literally

33
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,680
have your laptop in your bag

34
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,080
as you drive around

35
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,960
and whenever you get to stop somewhere,

36
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,600
you do the work and then you get to travel

37
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,040
and see some nice views

38
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,080
and different hikes?

39
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,360
Yeah. So, usually we choose an Airbnb

40
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,160
with very good Internet.

41
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,640
Yeah.

42
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,480
This is number one.

43
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,960
And then we try to,

44
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,640
if we manage to finish the day a bit early,

45
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,360
then we manage to hike a bit

46
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,200
and see, explore the area,

47
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,760
but if not only just the weekend

48
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,400
is amazing.

49
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,160
You get to see really amazing sceneries

50
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,080
these days.

51
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,920
And there is no

52
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,640
so much people around.

53
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,360
Right right. This is the perfect time.

54
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,000
Shiran, that's amazing.

55
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,360
So, I want to go back to your journey.

56
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,560
Lawyer, Jolt, so many different companies

57
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:23,920
along the way.

58
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,640
And all of a sudden,

59
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,120
I just love personally Jolt,

60
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,800
Roei and Nadav are such great people.

61
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,280
And now, most recently, the CEO

62
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,880
and co-founder of Cassiopeia Tech,

63
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,280
probably the most relevant thing

64
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,200
I've heard in the covid age.

65
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,720
But you didn't start this startup

66
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,600
during the covid time.

67
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,240
You started it a while back.

68
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,880
So, tell me a little bit

69
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,000
about what Cassiopeia is

70
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,640
and the journey that took you

71
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,840
to create it.

72
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,040
Sure. So, my background

73
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,440
is in product management.

74
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,760
I led product teams in Israeli tech,

75
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,040
in small companies, large companies.

76
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,160
I also led the product management course

77
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,960
at Jolt, as you mentioned.

78
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:07,160
It was amazing to just teach

79
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,160
other product managers

80
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,840
about the practices and methods.

81
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,440
You were actually a teacher

82
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,480
for a course, right?

83
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,280
For one of the courses that they offer?

84
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,680
Yeah, I was a moderator

85
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,840
of one of the courses.

86
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,280
Yeah, it was amazing.

87
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,320
And as you mentioned, so my training is in

88
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,520
I'm a lawyer by training.

89
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,600
So, I hold a bachelor

90
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,480
and master degree in law.

91
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,920
And so, yeah, this was in another life.

92
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,080
And when I was working

93
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,360
as a product manager,

94
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,800
me and a few other friends

95
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,080
were gathering and thinking

96
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,880
about how we can use technology

97
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,400
to improve workplace environment.

98
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,600
And we were very passionate about that.

99
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,960
And because of personal experience we had, thought about -

100
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,800
Tell me about that specifically.

101
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,600
Why change the workplace environment now?

102
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,960
And what year are we talking about?

103
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,880
So, we started it when I was,

104
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,440
when I think it was 2017

105
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,800
when I'm still was working

106
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,720
and we were-

107
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
No covid yet.

108
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,400
No covid. No. Not yet.

109
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,040
And we were exploring about

110
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,440
how we can use technology

111
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,640
to just empower managers

112
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,080
to improve workplace environment.

113
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,400
And we realized that with our background

114
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,320
and our knowledge,

115
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
we can create a technology

116
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,160
that can analyze

117
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,640
different communication patterns.

118
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,560
So data like who sent to whom and when,

119
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,760
no text involved,

120
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,640
and just provide insights

121
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,280
about team behavior.

122
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,440
But what bothered you about

123
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,000
the way that things were happening?

124
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,960
Because in tech, it's all about efficiency

125
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,400
and productivity.

126
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,080
What was wrong with the way

127
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,960
that things were happening in 2017

128
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,680
that you felt like you had to go

129
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,840
and think of ways

130
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,160
to improve the workplace?

131
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,240
Yeah. I think in 2017,

132
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,280
so we had our own personal experience.

133
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,560
Some of the co-founders

134
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,440
experienced exclusion,

135
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,520
or aggressive behavior, and we felt,

136
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,520
and 2017 also, the MeToo just exploded.

137
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,720
There are some ... cases in Israel

138
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,200
about sexual harassment in the workplace

139
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,000
that was also very,

140
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,680
in the day to day talk, I would say.

141
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,520
And this is something

142
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,720
that really bothers us,

143
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,600
and we thought about

144
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,920
how come we are so data driven

145
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,640
about everything in our life,

146
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,240
but when it comes to people,

147
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,680
experiences in the workplace,

148
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,680
we are just about some

149
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:44,000
just using some kind of sense-
- Our intuition

150
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,880
Or if we hear some rumors about it,

151
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,640
we are not data driven at all.

152
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,400
So, we thought how we can use

153
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,600
our technology, our experience

154
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,160
in order to help managers to do it better.

155
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,160
So, okay. So, what are some of the things

156
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,800
that you're actually using this data for

157
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,920
and how does it actually work practically?

158
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,280
I'm assuming that there were

159
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,480
dramatic changes from the way

160
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,200
that your solution was adapted in 2019

161
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,080
versus 2020, and we'll get to that.

162
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,320
But first, take me back to 2019.

163
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,760
We're in the workplace.

164
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,520
You go to meetings.

165
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,880
You have, you do different projects.

166
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,680
You send different emails.

167
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,960
Where does Cassiopeia

168
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,120
go into this whole pipeline of work?

169
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,680
Yeah. So, what we do

170
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,000
we just gather the data from email,

171
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
from Slacks, the chat platform,

172
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,960
also Microsoft Team, from Calendar,

173
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,280
and from the video platform.

174
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,080
And we just take the data, as I mentioned,

175
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,800
just the metadata.

176
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,080
So, data like, who sent to whom and when.

177
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,640
It takes between 10 to 15 minutes

178
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,520
to finish the technical onboarding,

179
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,920
and that's it.

180
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,520
And then we are just ready to go

181
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,600
sending weekly email reports to managers

182
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
with the most fervent insights for them

183
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,480
for this week.

184
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,360
So, give me examples of some insights

185
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,120
that I might be getting as a manager

186
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,040
if I'm leading a team of engineers

187
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,760
or product managers in a startup.

188
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,920
So, what are some things

189
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,800
that I would be getting

190
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,880
in my weekly summary?

191
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,160
Yeah. So, it really depends on you

192
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,720
as a manager.

193
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,680
So, part of the onboarding process,

194
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,360
you as a manager,

195
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,600
would be able to customize your report.

196
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,600
Basically decide what kind of insights

197
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,120
are more relevant for you,

198
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,720
what you would like to see

199
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,960
in your report.

200
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,080
But there is different insights

201
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,240
about collaboration.

202
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,360
For example,

203
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,400
collaboration within your team,

204
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,760
but also between teams.

205
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,280
If there is interrupting collaboration

206
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,080
between two teams,

207
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,360
you would know about it, for example.

208
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,800
About new employees,

209
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,480
onboarding new employees these days

210
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,600
is extremely challenging.
- Yeah.

211
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,880
So, a lot of insights about that.

212
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,200
So, for example, if we see

213
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,840
new employees in certain departments

214
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,280
that are less connected

215
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,720
compared to their teammates,

216
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,280
are less engaged

217
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,360
so we also will highlight it for managers

218
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,560
to just for them to be aware

219
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,800
that they need to provide more support

220
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,760
for these employees.

221
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,280
So, a lot about that.

222
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,000
Communication.

223
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,720
How to optimize our communication

224
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,760
within the company.

225
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,480
So, a lot of things that basically

226
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,080
every team needs these days.

227
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,960
I mean it sounds to me like

228
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,960
what you are opening up here

229
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,080
is this opportunity where

230
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,320
if I'm the CEO of a company

231
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,160
I can come and say,

232
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,040
Well, the culture that I want to have

233
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,040
in my company is I want people

234
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,880
to be communicating very efficiently.

235
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,880
So I'm expecting them to be on Slack

236
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,840
and answer promptly to others.

237
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,640
I'm expecting them

238
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,240
to finish their meetings on time

239
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,720
and not schedule back to back.

240
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,680
If I'm setting these cultural guidelines

241
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,480
and all of a sudden,

242
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,400
I can come in and see,

243
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,880
Okay, what's actually happening

244
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,320
in my 1,000 person organization?

245
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,040
Are people actually having

246
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,280
like six hour meetings a day

247
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,400
instead of just doing deep dives?

248
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,240
Maybe we have to teach people

249
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,360
how to have better meetings

250
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,440
or be more efficient

251
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,960
in their Slack communication.

252
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,200
So, that sounds hugely relevant.

253
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,960
But how did you deal with the fact that

254
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,160
a lot of the meetings don't take place

255
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,560
over a video or over Slack?

256
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,280
A lot of them are,

257
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,640
let's go to the water fountain

258
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,840
and speak next to the

259
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,040
like we do in school.

260
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,000
Yeah. So, we're working mostly with teams

261
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,240
that are working remotely.

262
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,120
So their almost all communication is online.

263
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,080
And when we are talking to you remotely,

264
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,760
there is the reason

265
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,320
it's so relevant these days,

266
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,600
is that when you are talking to you remotely,

267
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,680
there is what they're assigning

268
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,760
different ways and different variations.

269
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,760
But they just describe that

270
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,120
as a manager, a remote manager,

271
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,320
you're basically working

272
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,520
with a smaller data set.

273
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,520
So, you don't have

274
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,720
all these small data points

275
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,240
you used to have in the office.

276
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,280
You don't see how people engage,

277
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,360
with whom they're drinking coffee with,

278
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,880
if they're smiling during the day.

279
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,320
You don't have it anymore.

280
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,200
And so, as a remote leader,

281
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:55,160
there is a gap here that was created.

282
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,440
And what we do at Cassiopeia,

283
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,280
we are helping them to close that gap.

284
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,040
Just providing them the insights they need

285
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,080
to get a better sense

286
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,440
of their team dynamics

287
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,040
and spot some issues in a timely manner.

288
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,640
So, yeah. This is what ...

289
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,520
Okay. So, now we've reached 2020,

290
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,880
and the world has basically

291
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,000
turned upside down.

292
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,680
Every company that tried

293
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,600
to remain a social company in the office

294
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,200
is forced into this remote environment.

295
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,000
I was onboarded into Hippo insurance

296
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,360
as a remote employee.

297
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,360
So, I never actually met my manager

298
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,880
face to face, even though we often are

299
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,800
one mile away from each other.

300
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,720
But I think that I had a privilege

301
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,600
in having this introduction

302
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,400
into this remote work

303
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,800
having been onboarded back in mid-March

304
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,760
right when this all started.

305
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,480
And I got to see

306
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,880
Okay. What are some of the challenges

307
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
of onboarding?

308
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,040
And I have to say that Hippo

309
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,320
did a fantastic job with that.

310
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,720
But I can see

311
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,520
why it could be so challenging.

312
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,480
So, what has changed

313
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,560
in terms of Cassiopeia

314
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,400
over the last six months or so

315
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,840
since covid began?

316
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,240
Yeah. So as I mentioned,

317
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,840
at Cassiopeia, we were providing insights

318
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,400
about team behavior.

319
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,400
And in 2019 we were focusing

320
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,760
on providing more insights

321
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,880
about non-inclusive behavior.

322
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,680
So, more about aggressive behavior

323
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,560
and exclusion.

324
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,280
We worked with large companies,

325
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,760
mostly in the US and UK.

326
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,800
And when covid hit,

327
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,840
two of our customers

328
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,280
reached out to us and told us,

329
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,280
"This whole remote work thing

330
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,240
is really challenging for us.

331
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,400
Most of our managers

332
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,080
are not used to lead people remotely.

333
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,560
What can you do to help?"

334
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,760
And this just started this cycle,

335
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,520
and I will save you the details,

336
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,680
but just to make the long story short,

337
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,560
we decided to use our technology,

338
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,520
Cassiopeia's technology,

339
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,920
to empower remote leaders.

340
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,760
And yeah, basically we have the privilege,

341
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,000
and I'm very grateful for it,

342
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,960
to empower so many amazing leaders

343
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,760
and managers these days. So, yeah.

344
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,320
That's fantastic.

345
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:02,960
Talk to me a little bit

346
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,480
about the onboarding process.

347
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,480
I'm always curious about that.

348
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,080
So, you have this great platform.

349
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,400
Basically, every single company

350
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,560
in the world is now a relevant customer

351
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,360
for your platform.

352
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,480
What's your strategy?

353
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,400
Like you're in March. You realize that,

354
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,440
okay, this is my time to put on the gas.

355
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,400
Like, let's double down and get there.

356
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,040
What do you do as the CEO

357
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,160
to make that happen?

358
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,640
Yeah.

359
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,960
So, first of all,

360
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,240
to understand who is our early adopters,

361
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,320
and we are working mostly

362
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,920
with tech companies in the UK, in the US,

363
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,800
and we're working very closely with,

364
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,400
usually with R&D.

365
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,920
So the VP of R&D, or the VP engineering,

366
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,560
the of VP product, or the CTO.

367
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,280
Why is that?

368
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,240
Why more of the technical side?

369
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,120
I would actually imagine

370
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,880
that it would be more of the sales side,

371
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,160
or more of the product management part

372
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,040
of the company.

373
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,080
Yeah. So, also product.

374
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,040
We have also product teams.

375
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,880
But the reason that we are working

376
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,280
very closely with R&D and product

377
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,840
is that usually what we are,

378
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,560
the kind of insights we provide

379
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,480
about collaboration,

380
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,200
about communication,

381
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,720
really affect directly

382
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,160
on their performance.

383
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,280
And it's really crucial.

384
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,200
And also, there's a lot of challenges

385
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,360
working remotely

386
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,120
for R&D and product teams.

387
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,240
They need to collaborate

388
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,480
all the time and be synchronized.

389
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,800
So, there is a lot of value

390
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,520
that these teams just get

391
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,120
from using Cassiopeia.

392
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,840
And also, it's usually, and to be

393
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,680
very direct and open about it.

394
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,080
Usually this is the kind of teams

395
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,840
that are also very powerful

396
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,600
within the company.

397
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,280
So, if they want to use the tool

398
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,400
it's easy for them to buy it.

399
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,520
So, yeah.

400
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,760
So, part of the strategy then

401
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,880
is to go to these early adopters,

402
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,280
these teams that have the influence

403
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,000
within the company

404
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,360
and go to this R&D manager,

405
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,040
have them adopt within the team.

406
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,840
Hopefully have this then spread out

407
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,480
inside of the corporation

408
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,280
and that way you're actually getting

409
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,880
also exposed to different segments

410
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,080
of the company

411
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,680
that might not be incentivized

412
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,440
from day zero

413
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,920
to go into your platform, right?

414
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,840
Yeah.

415
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,320
That's so so cool.

416
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,000
So, three years down the line,

417
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,440
why are you still doing this?

418
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,800
What's up ahead?

419
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,400
I mean, what gets you really excited

420
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,720
about Cassiopeia today?

421
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,320
Yeah. So, I quit my job two years ago

422
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,800
to just lead Cassiopeia full time.

423
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,360
And it's basically the best ride I had.

424
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,000
So, I think you can learn so much

425
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,720
as a founder,

426
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:47,760
but also, I think, what I can say is that,

427
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,200
when you're very connected

428
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,040
to your mission and very passionate

429
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,120
about what you're doing,

430
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,000
and also doing it with amazing people,

431
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,880
basically, it's the ideal situation

432
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,160
for me as a person.

433
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,240
So, I get a chance to work

434
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,360
with amazing people,

435
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,520
doing amazing things,

436
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,960
build amazing products.

437
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,120
So yeah, this is why I keep doing it.

438
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,600
And where are we headed in terms

439
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,040
of remote work, collaboration?

440
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,480
Do you expect that managers

441
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,280
are gonna have even more tools

442
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,720
than what we have today?

443
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,960
And is this going to somewhat also

444
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,720
adversely affect the personal relationship

445
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,960
between a manager and their employees?

446
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,680
Because I'm imagining

447
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,400
the more data they have in regards to,

448
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,560
if my manager knows

449
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,880
my promptness to communicate on Slack

450
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,840
and whether I'm smiling or not,

451
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,680
that could detach a little bit

452
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,000
from her mission

453
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,360
to personally get to know me,

454
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,480
but more base her assumption

455
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,400
of my behavior

456
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,600
based on the analytics that you provide.

457
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,280
Yeah.

458
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,240
So, I would say that

459
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,440
what we see is a trend here.

460
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,560
And I think it's extremely interesting

461
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,280
that if you think about how companies

462
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,920
used to know or understand their culture,

463
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,160
or identify problems in their dynamics

464
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,680
in a timely manner.

465
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,320
What we used to do is as companies,

466
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:04,960
in the beginning,

467
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,900
we performed some kind of survey.

468
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,660
Endless surveys. I was just about to say.

469
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,240
In the Army, every two minutes

470
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,400
I had a survey to fill out.

471
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,520
Exactly. So you know

472
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,760
what I'm talking about.

473
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:22,080
Usually, it's some kind of external,
was external consultant

474
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,160
doing some surveys.

475
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,920
And this was the first stage, right?

476
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,280
And then the second stage

477
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,800
was survey softwares,

478
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,040
like Culture Amp and Peakon.

479
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,480
So, companies can do it in-house.

480
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,560
Right.

481
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,640
And both stages are more designed

482
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,760
for HR people,

483
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,000
human resource people.

484
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,960
And this was great.

485
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,040
And then the next stage

486
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,680
was using more advanced data.

487
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,240
So, data like the network analysis things

488
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,720
that we are doing.

489
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,760
More advanced data also for software

490
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,520
that are designed for HR and

491
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,800
people analytics. People persons.

492
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,480
So, you can see a very complex dashboard

493
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,720
with a lot of graphs,

494
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,120
and you need to really dig into the data

495
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,320
to get what you need.

496
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,240
And now, these days,

497
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,880
what we notice is that there is,

498
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,200
now we are getting to the last stage

499
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,880
which is more people analytics platforms

500
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,920
that are designed for managers.

501
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,000
So, because almost all communication

502
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,920
shifted to online,

503
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,800
there is more power for people analytics,

504
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,080
for technologies that use

505
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,720
this information to get more insights.

506
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,640
Also, managers are expected

507
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,520
to be more responsible

508
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,760
for an employee's experience,

509
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,080
as you mentioned.

510
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,160
And definitely there is a need for it,

511
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:47,200
because the work is so dynamic

512
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,640
and there is so many challenges.

513
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,040
You can't really allow yourself

514
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,920
as a manager just to use this survey

515
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,600
once in a year or something like that

516
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,600
to get to understand

517
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,240
your team dynamic better.

518
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,360
It doesn't make sense

519
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,760
in today's atmosphere.

520
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,160
So, this is what we are getting into.

521
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,440
Some people analytics solution

522
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,800
that are more designed for managers.

523
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,560
This is what we do at Cassiopeia.

524
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,000
And the employees

525
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,280
have no problem with this, right?

526
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,720
They're installing the software

527
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,400
that basically allows their managers

528
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,200
to get analytics based on their behavior.

529
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,960
Is there any pushback from that,

530
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,320
or do they just accept it?

531
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,600
Yeah. So, you're touching

532
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,120
really crucial points.

533
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,680
So, when you're using data

534
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,360
there is a lot of power there.

535
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,520
There is also a great responsibility.

536
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,880
And there is a big question

537
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,280
about how to use this data.

538
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,080
And what we do at Cassiopeia,

539
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,520
we provide insights on the team level,

540
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,440
or a subgroup level,

541
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,960
such as new employees.

542
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,520
But we won't show, for example,

543
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,920
that Dan is not talking that much

544
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,640
with John this week, for example.

545
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,920
So, we are not gonna show any analytics

546
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,880
that the manager is not aware of

547
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,240
about specific individuals

548
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,400
because we want to make sure

549
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,040
that people feel comfortable

550
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,400
using the platform.

551
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
And I think this is, again,

552
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,920
one of the most fascinating examples

553
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,720
that we're seeing more and more

554
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,160
in the past 10 years or so,

555
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,200
that we have the data,

556
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,600
we have the insights.

557
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,880
We're not allowing ourselves to know them.

558
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,000
And these are insights

559
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,880
that will make the workplace better.

560
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,680
If the manager did know

561
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,360
that Dan and Hila

562
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,920
are not speaking to each other

563
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,600
even though they're on the same team,

564
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,440
then they could take some action

565
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,480
to help correct that.

566
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,000
But obviously, the drawbacks

567
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
of having them be adversely affected

568
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
by that knowledge

569
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,760
and feeling that it's no longer

570
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,320
a safe space for them to operate,

571
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,040
that is a big problem.

572
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,880
Shiran, right before we leave,

573
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,400
I have to ask you

574
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,320
the most important question,

575
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,000
and I'm gonna put you on the spot once.

576
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,040
I need three words that you would use

577
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
to describe yourself.

578
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,480
Wow. This is I think,

579
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,840
it's the most difficult question.

580
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,320
And it's the most fun one.

581
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,960
I know. I know. I know.

582
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,400
But it's so hard. Okay, I will try.

583
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,840
I think the first one

584
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,720
will be a problem solver.

585
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,440
I'm really passionate about

586
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,160
solving problems

587
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,840
and maybe it's part of the reason why

588
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,960
I'm an entrepreneur.

589
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,160
So, definitely this is my first word.

590
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,480
The second word,

591
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,560
and I'm gonna cheat a bit,

592
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,640
but I think it's about

593
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,040
more pushing the limits.

594
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,650
Everybody is cheating on this thing.

595
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:20,960
I know. I know. It's so tempting.

596
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,800
But I think it's about pushing the limits

597
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
on a personal level,

598
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,680
but also on a business level.

599
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,320
I deeply feel that this is the only way

600
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,360
to really to develop our self

601
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,320
and to get to new places

602
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,080
as business and people.

603
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,080
So I, for example, I pushed myself

604
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,840
a few years ago.

605
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,520
I decided to run a full marathon.

606
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,200
And this was my first time.

607
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,000
And this was an amazing experience.

608
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,840
So, I really try in my day to day.

609
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,560
I love it. Which marathon was this?

610
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,600
Tel Aviv.

611
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,080
The Tel Aviv marathon. Amazing.

612
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,040
I planned to do the one in ...

613
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,000
but it got cancelled.

614
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,520
I actually, I signed up

615
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,040
for the Eilat marathon of 2017.

616
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,200
And only when I got there I realized

617
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,000
that I signed up to run on dunes

618
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,920
instead of a nice road.

619
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,160
Much harder.

620
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,120
It was an interesting experience

621
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,200
to say the least.

622
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,520
I'm still doing exercises

623
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
to relieve the tension,

624
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,960
but it was a good experience

625
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,480
no matter what.

626
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,820
Shiran, very lasting thing.

627
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,160
One advice you would give yourself.

628
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,040
We didn't even talk about this transition

629
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,880
from being a lawyer

630
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,640
and you were dealing with IP stuff

631
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,200
to being a product manager

632
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,960
and then an entrepreneur.

633
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,600
It doesn't sound like

634
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,800
the natural transition

635
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,320
for a lot of entrepreneurs

636
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,520
and a lot of product managers.

637
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,920
What is a piece of advice

638
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,200
that you would now go back

639
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,760
to the Hebrew University

640
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,400
where you were studying

641
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,000
and give yourself,

642
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,280
"Shiran, this is my two cents

643
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,480
from the future"

644
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,040
Wow.

645
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,080
This one might even be harder

646
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,040
than the three words.

647
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,360
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

648
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,880
You're really pushing my limits here.

649
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,960
So I would say keep an open mind.

650
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,840
There's so many amazing things,

651
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,760
and I was sure that

652
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,600
I'm gonna be a lawyer or a judge

653
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,720
and this was my purpose in life.

654
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,240
And I discovered there is amazing things,

655
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,040
other amazing things,

656
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,560
that are a better fit for me.

657
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,880
So, just to keep to be open minded

658
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,920
about opportunities,

659
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,440
and to just keep learning,

660
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,680
I think, this is the main thing.

661
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,360
I love it.

662
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,880
Shiran, toda raba.

663
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,440
Enjoy Yellowstone. Enjoy Oregon.

664
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,080
And I love what you're doing there.

665
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,160
And I can't wait to share this

666
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,520
with the world.

667
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,360
Thank you very much.

668
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,080
Thank you.

669
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,960
Thank you for having me.

670
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,480
Bye bye.
