1
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,440
Marissa Orr, thank you for joining me

2
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,520
on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,560
How are you?

4
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,560
Thank you for having me.

5
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm doing well today, thanks.

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,880
Looking forward to our chat.

7
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,480
I'm extremely excited for our chat

8
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,400
because I love the episodes

9
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,320
where I get to just hear people's journey.

10
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,520
And hear about

11
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,600
the different twists and turns they took

12
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,640
to their non-linear career pathways.

13
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,640
Yet it somehow ends up with

14
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,080
a very optimistic note

15
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,160
of passion and curiosity, which I think

16
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,000
is going to happen here as well.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,840
So, Marissa, tell me a little bit about

18
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,960
your both experience

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,560
as a business executive in top companies

20
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,080
but also now as a business owner.

21
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,120
Yeah. So, I started working at Google

22
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,720
back in 2003 and that was before

23
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,840
the company had gone public.

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,560
I was working in New York City.

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,680
I graduated college

26
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,960
or grad school not too early,

27
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,240
not too long before then.

28
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,440
And actually got the Google interview

29
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,680
through this old Yahoo jobs board

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,400
called HotJobs at which

31
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,200
people your age wouldn't know about.

32
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,960
But anybody my age remembers it very well.

33
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,200
There was about 50 people

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,400
in the New York office of Google

35
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,200
at the time, now there's maybe 10,000.

36
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,920
So, it was a very different place.

37
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,800
I really got to grow up there in my career

38
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,360
because I worked there for 13 years

39
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,880
all through my early, mid,

40
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,600
late 20s and 30s.

41
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,120
And then, after 13 years

42
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,200
I left for a role at Facebook

43
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,840
and I was there

44
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,360
for about a year and a half.

45
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,720
And it was not the experience

46
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,120
that I had imagined when I joined.

47
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,920
And I go into detail about

48
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,800
only now in my book.

49
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,840
But essentially,

50
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,120
it was a pretty bad experience.

51
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,600
And everybody in my life

52
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,360
was telling me to go back to Google,

53
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,520
I had a great career there.

54
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,320
Or find another company in tech.

55
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,040
But that experience really put me

56
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,200
in a very deep, dark place

57
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,840
where I started asking myself

58
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,560
these big life questions like:

59
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,440
who am I;

60
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,720
and, what do I want.

61
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,240
And I knew there was something in me

62
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,440
that was never going to manifest

63
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,720
in the corporate world.

64
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,480
My potential is limited

65
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,200
as a very creative person.

66
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,840
Now, while I was at Google, I had started

67
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,280
this women's leadership series

68
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,120
that was a bit irreverent and counter

69
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,760
to the conventional wisdom,

70
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,880
and it started to grow in popularity.

71
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,840
I started doing lectures

72
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,000
at not only at Google

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,480
but other companies in New York City

74
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,640
and other colleges in New York City.

75
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,560
And at Facebook,

76
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,880
I really came to terms with the fact

77
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,960
that I wanted to devote my life

78
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,240
to that sort of thing,

79
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,320
speaking full time and writing a book,

80
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,800
turning my lecture series into a book.

81
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
So, I started doing that

82
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,080
while I was at Facebook.

83
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,920
And here I am now.

84
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,280
I don't want to paint the picture

85
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,920
because the context here is not just

86
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,520
that you are a successful executive

87
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,480
for over a decade at the top companies

88
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,840
in the tech scene in the world,

89
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
but when you decide

90
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,840
to make that transition

91
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,600
you're also a mother of three,

92
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,680
a single mother of three.

93
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,840
This is not just a random decision

94
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,600
that as a 24 year old, I can say,

95
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,840
yeah, of course, a lot of people

96
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,920
want to leave the corporate world

97
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,320
and start their own companies.

98
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,600
This is a little bit more complicated

99
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,640
than the average

100
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,400
24 year old mind set, right?

101
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,040
Absolutely.

102
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,040
It's a great point and call that to make

103
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,080
because it really defines

104
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,080
the essence of my journey.

105
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,640
Which is here I am,

106
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,000
I live in a nice neighborhood

107
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,680
in New Jersey,

108
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,840
I'm financially independent

109
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,160
and I have three kids to take care of,

110
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,440
a rent to pay,

111
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,960
and I'm not a financial risk taker.

112
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,560
So, the idea that I would leave this world

113
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,920
where I made this lucrative salary

114
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,960
at these great companies

115
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,520
and had a great career

116
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,320
and just bet it all on this pipe dream,

117
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,720
what it seemed like a pipe dream

118
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,680
because I'd never written anything before.

119
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,640
I mean, I had written but I had no name,

120
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,840
I had no social following,

121
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,080
I wasn't a recognized person,

122
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,400
I have never published anything.

123
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
The idea that I can get a book deal

124
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,120
or write a book and then become a speaker

125
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
and follow my passions

126
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,200
which is really absurd

127
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
from the outside in.

128
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,600
And even, I have to tell you,

129
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,760
in my own family,

130
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,360
and I'm very close to my parents

131
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,720
and they're wonderful and supportive.

132
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,360
But my mom is the daughter

133
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,760
of Eastern European immigrants

134
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,240
who really came here

135
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,840
and pull themselves up

136
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,440
from their boots.

137
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,440
It's very business oriented family.

138
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
Like the idea that I would do this

139
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,880
was so absurd.

140
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,360
And we didn't talk about the book

141
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,040
for about a year in my family.

142
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,680
It was it didn't exist.

143
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,960
Wow.

144
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,520
Yeah.

145
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,080
I knew how crazy it seemed.

146
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,640
And talking about it with them

147
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,600
upset me

148
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,320
because I really needed the support

149
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,640
and I know it upset them.

150
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,120
So, we just didn't talk about it.

151
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,600
And then I remember like one year

152
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,680
at Thanksgiving we're all drinking,

153
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,800
and then during dessert

154
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,120
my brother in law was like,

155
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,960
"So, how's the book going?"

156
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,880
And it was like the music stopped

157
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,240
and everyone's like, "Oh."

158
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,840
And so, I say that, because I think

159
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,640
it's really important to anyone

160
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,680
that is going on this journey.

161
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,760
I mean, you hear it

162
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,840
to the point where it's cliche,

163
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,480
but it's cliche because it's true.

164
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,840
Which is very very few people

165
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,120
understand what you're doing

166
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,800
and support it.

167
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,760
Because only you have the full picture

168
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,560
of what's going on.

169
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,520
Only you know

170
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,240
what you're truly capable of.

171
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,160
So, that was really difficult for me.

172
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,440
It was to depart from the standard story

173
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,320
of how my life was supposed to unfold.

174
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,240
The storyline that was approved

175
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,280
by my parents that I went along with

176
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,880
without thinking about,

177
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,120
and then the money piece

178
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,680
was probably even bigger than that.

179
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,160
So, I made a great salary

180
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,880
and I had a certain amount of savings.

181
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,480
And when I decided to do this,

182
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,560
I knew I was going to be

183
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,600
fired from Facebook.

184
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,680
I had this and I go into detail

185
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,760
about it in the book.

186
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,160
I got into this situation where I was,

187
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,280
it was just a bad situation.

188
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,480
So, knowing I was going to be fired

189
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,800
eventually,

190
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,520
that's when everyone was telling me,

191
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,240
like jump ship, go back to Google.

192
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,120
And that's when I made the decision,

193
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,720
"You know what?"

194
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,760
"I'm going to ride this out

195
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,560
as long as I can so I can get the salary

196
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,920
while I work on the book proposal."

197
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,800
So, one really important piece of this,

198
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,680
so, the summer of 2017,

199
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,680
I started writing the book proposal

200
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,440
in June of 2017.

201
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,000
And the very first thing I did

202
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,760
was I sat down

203
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,200
and I Googled how to write a book.

204
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,680
No joke.

205
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,000
Really?

206
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,720
Yeah. That was my first step.

207
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
I did all the research,

208
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,960
I have to write a proposal,

209
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,520
I bought a book

210
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,160
on how to write a book proposal.

211
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,760
And I would wake up,

212
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,520
keep in mind

213
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,560
I'm still working at Facebook,

214
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,320
so I'd wake up, I thought,

215
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,760
"When am I going to do this?"

216
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,040
I have three kids.

217
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
I have an hour and a half

218
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,000
commute each way.

219
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,400
So, I start waking up

220
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,320
at 4:30 in the morning.

221
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,360
And I worked on the book proposal

222
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,680
for about an hour and a half.

223
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,040
And then I would get the kids up

224
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,960
and I would get to work

225
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,280
and they would go to school.

226
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,920
And any free time that I had,

227
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,840
I was like possessed with this idea.

228
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,800
I didn't tell very many people about it.

229
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,600
Which is very different

230
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,360
than how I'd handled

231
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,480
creative ideas in the past.

232
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,040
I get all excited, I tell everyone.

233
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,860
And then [--].

234
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,520
I decided this was going to be different

235
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,440
in order to take myself seriously.

236
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,200
And to really do this

237
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,400
I couldn't tell people about it.

238
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,760
I needed to prove to myself

239
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,680
that I was taking myself seriously.

240
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,560
So, I did end up getting fired,

241
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,880
again, I write all about it in the book,

242
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,880
in September of 2017.

243
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,640
I was about 95% done

244
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,960
with the book proposal.

245
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,240
And I think that's the key.

246
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,640
Because I probably

247
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,160
would have gone back to Google

248
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,680
or a different company,

249
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,240
If you didn't have the momentum

250
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,920
for the book, right?

251
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,320
Exactly.

252
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,480
Now, just for the context for listeners,

253
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,720
when you say book proposal,

254
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,280
is this like an initial draft of the book?

255
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,040
Or is this an abstract for the book?

256
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,760
Yeah. So, it's what you have to write

257
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,240
in order to get a book deal.

258
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,440
And a lot of people,

259
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,280
and especially, I think this is a point

260
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,400
to just pause on

261
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,760
for people that are younger

262
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,520
that don't have the context.

263
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,320
A lot of people self publish today.

264
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,800
But that's where

265
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,080
being a single mom comes in.

266
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,560
I knew that nobody makes money

267
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,240
on books these days.

268
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,480
So, I knew that the way

269
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,720
I was going to make money was speaking,

270
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,240
which is my passion anyway.

271
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,760
And in order to get the fees

272
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,280
as a speaker that I needed,

273
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,160
I needed to have a book published

274
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,080
by a traditional publisher.

275
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,600
Because if I went the grassroots scrapie

276
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,000
like gain a social media following,

277
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,560
gain power that way

278
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,400
and then self publish or whatever,

279
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,120
it was going to take too long.

280
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,040
I didn't have the luxury to do that

281
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,400
and I was starting from zero.

282
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,360
But I knew that

283
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,880
I really believed in my book idea

284
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
and I knew it was going to be

285
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,000
a great book.

286
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,720
So, the book proposal

287
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,800
is what you have to write

288
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,920
in order to get a book deal

289
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,840
with the publisher.

290
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,040
You don't have to write one

291
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,400
if you're self publishing.

292
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,360
And there's good reasons to self publish.

293
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,640
And there's reasons to go

294
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,920
with the traditional publisher.

295
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,800
So, I started with the traditional

296
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,040
and the book proposal took me many months.

297
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,000
I mean, I really put my blood,

298
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,600
sweat and tears into it.

299
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,160
And once I was done,

300
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,120
that's when I started looking for agents.

301
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,160
And at this point,

302
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,280
so I was fired in September,

303
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,240
now it's like being in November

304
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,400
and I have no contacts in book publishing.

305
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,800
I don't know anyone.

306
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,600
So, I just started reaching out

307
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,000
to everybody in my network

308
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,520
asking if they could help me

309
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,960
by introducing me

310
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,160
to anyone they know

311
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,720
that has anything to do with books.

312
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,600
They wrote a book,

313
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,280
they know someone who wrote a book,

314
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,880
they know someone who works in publishing.

315
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,320
They read books.

316
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,440
Right. They read books.

317
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,720
I was meeting with a million people

318
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,480
and trying to figure out

319
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,840
how to get an agent.

320
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,640
Because it's really hard

321
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,120
just to get an agent.

322
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,960
Forget about getting a deal.

323
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,000
So, I end up getting an agent.

324
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,840
We send the proposal out

325
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,840
to 20 publishing houses.

326
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,320
18 of them wrote back and said,

327
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,680
"We love the idea."

328
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,800
"It's provocative, we love the voice."

329
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,320
But, to summarize,

330
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,640
this isn't exactly what they said,

331
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
but this is the sentiment,

332
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,280
"It's too risky."

333
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,920
Because the way business books work,

334
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,360
they give deals to people they know

335
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,760
who have a following.

336
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,520
So that when the book comes out,

337
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,440
the publisher doesn't have

338
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,240
to spend money marketing it.

339
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,840
This is how business books work.

340
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,240
And this is why in order to get published

341
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,000
as a business book,

342
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,480
you need to be an academic

343
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,320
or a researcher.

344
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,600
You need to be like an Adam Grant

345
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,560
or Simon Sinek or Brené Brown,

346
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,440
because then it's not risky.

347
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,080
But I represented a huge risk

348
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,880
because who's going to buy

349
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,800
a business book

350
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,120
from somebody without credentials

351
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,160
and without the academic or the title.

352
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,360
So, 18 out of 20 loved it,

353
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,560
but I was too risky.

354
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,760
One we never heard back from.

355
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,800
And then the one

356
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,640
at HarperCollins Leadership,

357
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,960
which was a developing entity

358
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,360
within the bigger umbrella, loved it.

359
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,960
And against all odds, got the deal.

360
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,680
Then I had to write the book.

361
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,800
I didn't even address your question

362
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,960
which is what is the proposal.

363
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,080
So, the proposal is really

364
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,560
you selling the book.

365
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,560
And now, if you're Justin Timberlake,

366
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,120
you don't have to write a proposal.

367
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,040
Like they write one for you, basically

368
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,960
and say, "Can you sign with us?"

369
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,480
But if you're not,

370
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,160
you need to explain the book, the concept,

371
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,800
what it's about, and you have to sell it.

372
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,000
Which is a very different thing

373
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,800
than just writing the book.

374
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,360
It's like sending a slide deck

375
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,320
to an investor.

376
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:24,800
Yes.

377
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,800
But it also has a very detailed outline

378
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,440
of each chapter.

379
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,560
It has like two or three sample chapters.

380
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,200
It has a market analysis

381
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,480
so you have to do all the work for it.

382
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:34,920
Oh, yeah.

383
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,920
I had a whole customer segmentation.

384
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,440
And I had done a lot

385
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,600
of stuff like that at Google,

386
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,360
a little at Facebook, where I knew

387
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,840
how to sell something.

388
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,520
I knew how to sell a value proposition,

389
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,800
I knew how to market something.

390
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,520
So, I wrote that proposal

391
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,840
like my life depended on it

392
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,280
and that's what a proposal is, so.

393
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,120
Wow. Okay, so talk to me a little bit

394
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,720
about Lean Out,

395
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,920
and then I'd love to also hear

396
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,120
about the different speaking engagements

397
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
and the some of the messages

398
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,320
that you're bringing to the world now

399
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,400
through your journey.

400
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,360
So what is Lean Out about?

401
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,960
I'm guessing that it has something to do

402
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,680
with something that Sheryl wrote.

403
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,040
But please tell me.

404
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,320
So Sheryl Sandberg, of course,

405
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,520
she's the CEO of Facebook

406
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,840
and she's the author of Lean In.

407
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,120
And if you're a woman my age,

408
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,680
you've probably read Lean In

409
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,520
because this came out in 2013

410
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,800
and it was like a bombshell

411
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,320
like women and leader.

412
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,040
This really defined modern feminism

413
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,880
for the women of my generation.

414
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,960
And my book is really a counter argument

415
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,920
because the premise of Lean In really

416
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,200
is that women are oppressed

417
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,160
by stereotypes and bias, and that's why

418
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,480
there's so few female executives

419
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,440
in the corporate world

420
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,720
and all that kind of stuff.

421
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,040
And gender bias,

422
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,800
all the popular themes of today.

423
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,520
My book really is the counter argument

424
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,600
which essentially,

425
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,720
it's funny I haven't done an interview

426
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,840
on the book in a while, so I'm like,

427
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,560
"What was my messaging?"

428
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,520
So, essentially what Lean Out is about

429
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,200
is that it's really has nothing to do

430
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,560
with women, it has to do

431
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,800
with the system set up

432
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,080
in the corporate world.

433
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,800
Which are basically these were,

434
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,560
these are corporate hierarchy

435
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,920
for power and dominance.

436
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,120
It's a zero sum game

437
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,160
for power and dominance.

438
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,320
And it was designed by the titans

439
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,920
of the Industrial Age.

440
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,480
And so, for example,

441
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,120
there's research that shows

442
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,160
that compared to men, women,

443
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,160
so compared to women, men prefer

444
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,160
competitive zero sum work environments

445
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,960
and they perform better in men.

446
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,440
Whereas women prefer

447
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,320
and performed better

448
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,000
in collaborative win-win

449
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,000
work environments.

450
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,280
And by its nature, as a triangle,

451
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,120
the corporate world is a zero sum game,

452
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,880
and that's number one.

453
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,480
Number two is that compared to men,

454
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,040
women have more life goals

455
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,320
and they're of greater variety.

456
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,400
Whereas men have fewer

457
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,320
and they're more focused

458
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,160
on money and rank and their career.

459
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,960
And so what happens is with promotions,

460
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,040
when you get escalating

461
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,080
management responsibility,

462
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,040
that usually pre-covid,

463
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,640
required you to be in the office

464
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,880
or FaceTime.

465
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,200
And that compromises

466
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,560
the balance and flexibility

467
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,680
that women really desire

468
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,400
to reach a greater variety of polls.

469
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,920
Now, there are no value judgments.

470
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,040
One is not better than the other.

471
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,080
But we have to take a look

472
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,280
at the system at work

473
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,320
and why it is biased

474
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,000
towards certain traits.

475
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,480
Because what really is happening

476
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,520
is that the people that make it to the top

477
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,320
make it because they have a certain

478
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,200
cocktail of personality traits

479
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,240
that lend themselves

480
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,480
to a zero sum game

481
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,520
for power and dominance.

482
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,400
A lot of women don't aspire

483
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,200
to manage large teams.

484
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,600
That was an issue with me.

485
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,000
And that's the only way to get promoted.

486
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,640
And it's seen as a lack of ambition.

487
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,400
I mean, that couldn't be further

488
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,160
from the truth.

489
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,480
Like you can make an impact

490
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,800
and have ambition

491
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,680
without managing large teams.

492
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,200
In fact, I felt like being a manager

493
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,400
diminished my impact.

494
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,000
Because I'm super creative,

495
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I was doing a lot of story development

496
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,840
and training, and I think

497
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,600
that puts a limit on the ceiling

498
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,040
for people who don't aspire

499
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,520
toward escalating amounts

500
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,520
of power and authority.

501
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,680
So, it's all about that.

502
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,320
But it's told through stories

503
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,840
about my time at Google and Facebook.

504
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,200
So, I say that because it's not

505
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,560
some dry academic analysis of work,

506
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,000
it's actually quite funny.

507
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,120
And I wrote it for two reasons.

508
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,800
One, I always felt

509
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,800
like there was something wrong with me.

510
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,040
Like I didn't fit in right,

511
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,200
like a square peg in a round

512
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,280
hole in the corporate world.

513
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,760
And I thought that was a reflection

514
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,400
of something was wrong with me.

515
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,160
And over 15 years,

516
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,480
I started to understand things

517
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,360
from a new perspective,

518
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,280
that there was nothing wrong with me.

519
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,760
And I wrote the book I needed to read

520
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,360
when I was starting out my career.

521
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,800
It is a very honest assessment

522
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,760
of what that world is all about

523
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,880
and what it requires to succeed.

524
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,000
Whereas I didn't know

525
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,200
what game I was playing

526
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,360
when I started out,

527
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,440
I just didn't understand it.

528
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,120
And so, my book is really,

529
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,440
here's the game you're playing

530
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,600
and if you love that, go for it.

531
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,520
If you don't, nothing's wrong with you.

532
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,360
It doesn't mean you don't have ambition.

533
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,400
And it's just the nature of the game.

534
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,400
You can change the rules,

535
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
but you can also change how you play it.

536
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,160
So, it's all about that.

537
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,480
And then I also wrote it,

538
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,880
I didn't hear any voices

539
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,040
in the public conversation

540
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,080
of women at work that I could relate to

541
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,480
or that I identify with,

542
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,400
so I wrote it for other women

543
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,840
to feel heard and understood.

544
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,840
And I think that's

545
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,840
what it's really accomplished.

546
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,640
I get messages

547
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,640
from women all over the world

548
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,320
thanking me

549
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
for putting their thoughts and feelings

550
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,000
into words that they didn't really know

551
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,720
how to express.

552
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,680
So, that's the book.

553
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,440
There's one other thing I wanted to say.

554
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,000
What about the responses

555
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,240
from the other gender?

556
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,920
I'm guessing that quite a few people

557
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,960
from your past have read the book,

558
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,160
took interest in it.

559
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,840
I'm guessing that it's not just to women

560
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,400
that read it.

561
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
Because it does sound

562
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,880
like you're painting a picture here that,

563
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,280
maybe controversial is not the right word,

564
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,360
but it does seem that

565
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,040
it is provocative.

566
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,480
So, how was the reception of that?

567
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,600
So, the reception

568
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,680
about it being provocative,

569
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,720
everybody leading up to is like,

570
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,320
"Oh, you're going to get

571
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,160
tons of hate, man."

572
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,200
"It's really divisive."

573
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,960
But I think for anyone who reads it,

574
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,040
it's not.

575
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,720
It's common sense

576
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,360
because it's a perspective

577
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,280
that they hadn't thought about,

578
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,400
but when it's shared,

579
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,720
it makes so much sense.

580
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,040
And I always say,

581
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,080
I never really understood why

582
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,280
it would be provocative.

583
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,440
Because if Sheryl Sandberg and I

584
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,400
both have a goal of helping women

585
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,240
and we both have

586
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,440
two different perspectives

587
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,880
on how to do that,

588
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,000
it shouldn't be controversial.

589
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,920
The women's voices shouldn't be limited

590
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,720
to one woman

591
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,240
who dominates the conversation,

592
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,800
and anyone who disagrees

593
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,480
has to be anti-woman.

594
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,000
It's really counter to an antithetical,

595
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,040
to the course of human progress.

596
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,160
To be able to say

597
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,600
just this one perspective

598
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,880
means that you support women.

599
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,000
And I think that it does

600
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,920
a lot of damage to women.

601
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,400
So, the reception has only been really

602
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,280
like women reaching out from,

603
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,440
I can tell you,

604
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,600
it's like they write me love letters

605
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,120
and I love it.

606
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,080
Because I clearly gave them a voice

607
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,120
and that's what I wanted to do.

608
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,920
The second half of the book, I think,

609
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,480
would be really interesting to men.

610
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,320
And the men that have read it

611
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,280
really appreciate it.

612
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,520
Because at the end of the day

613
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,040
it's not even about men and women.

614
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,040
It's about a certain type of person

615
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,600
that does well in that world.

616
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,000
And both men and women,

617
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,120
they do and they don't.

618
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,360
Maybe a little more women than men.

619
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,360
But there's like a whole universe

620
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,560
of men out there that can relate

621
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,400
to a lot of the things.

622
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,680
I did a Reddit AMA last year.

623
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,680
That's when I really reached more men.

624
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,000
But I think men assume

625
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,360
that they're not going to relate

626
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,440
because it's a female book.

627
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,680
But then if they do read it,

628
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,920
they end up really relating to it.

629
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,760
Sure. That's amazing.

630
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,760
So, 20 minutes go by so fast.

631
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,040
It's unbelievable.

632
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,520
If there is one message

633
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,800
that I can take away from this

634
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,880
or a lot of my friends,

635
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,320
whether they're guys or girls

636
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,720
at Stanford, for example,

637
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,720
could take away from either the book

638
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,000
or your different speaking engagements

639
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,160
or your journey as a whole,

640
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,400
what would the message be?

641
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,560
Well, the message of the book

642
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,080
at its very core is to,

643
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,600
it's again, cliche,

644
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,000
but it's to be who you are and own it.

645
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,200
And a lot of that

646
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,080
is about defining success

647
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,120
on your own terms.

648
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,120
Because there are so many things

649
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,000
we can get caught up,

650
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,120
and even school,

651
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,320
where success is defined for you

652
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,920
and people just go along with the script.

653
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,280
So, getting promoted at work,

654
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,920
that's like the definition of success.

655
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,080
But if you don't want certain things

656
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,360
that the system doles out as rewards,

657
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,560
you need to take a step back

658
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,240
and really take a hard look

659
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,600
at who you are, what you want.

660
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,640
And then let go of the noise around you.

661
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,880
And I really had to do that

662
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,920
on this journey to be an entrepreneur.

663
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,840
It's tough.

664
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,160
I'll close with this

665
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,280
because I know a lot of people,

666
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,400
this is a really the topic

667
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,520
that you talk about a lot.

668
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,600
I was in the corporate world for 15 years.

669
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,720
I made a great salary.

670
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,200
I had the prestige of working

671
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,480
at Google and Facebook

672
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,960
and all these amazing experiences

673
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,920
and security and benefits.

674
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,680
But there was something in me

675
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,240
that felt empty.

676
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,880
And now that I'm on this opposite journey,

677
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,840
it's very rewarding

678
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,800
but it's also very difficult.

679
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,080
So the point I'm making is

680
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,480
each has its trade offs

681
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,360
and you have to really

682
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,080
recognize that going in.

683
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,600
The one way I heard it put

684
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,800
that captures it beautifully

685
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,240
is when you leave the corporate world

686
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,080
to start your own thing,

687
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,720
you trade depression for anxiety.

688
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,560
And I think that's the best,

689
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,920
most concise way to put it.

690
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,080
It is not easy.

691
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,480
I mean, I miss that world

692
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,040
for so many reasons,

693
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,840
I would never trade

694
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,840
what I'm doing now for anything.

695
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,400
At the same time,

696
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,240
it's tough but that's life.

697
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,400
And I'd rather live doing this

698
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
and taking risks

699
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,880
and seeing how far I can go.

700
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,040
So, that's just me.

701
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,200
But I want an end on that note.

702
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,960
Marissa, thank you very very much.

703
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,160
This is wonderful.

704
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,920
I have to ask the last question,

705
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,920
three words that you would use

706
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,360
to describe yourself.

707
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,160
I would say

708
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:48,320
creative, free spirited and resilient.

709
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,840
Marissa, thank you very much.

710
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,920
It sounds like an incredible journey,

711
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,080
a difficult and joyous and optimistic

712
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,720
and rewarding at the end.

713
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,600
And definitely thank you

714
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,680
for spreading this message at the end.

715
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,600
I think, looking at the world

716
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,080
that I'm growing up in,

717
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,920
it is sometimes cut throat

718
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,720
and there's a lot

719
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,920
of competition sometimes.

720
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm very fortunate

721
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,160
to be in a community where I feel

722
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,960
that there's a lot of collaboration,

723
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,480
even more than there was competition.

724
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,640
But at the end, it's about

725
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,680
finding your personal passion and reward.

726
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,280
And so thank you for sharing that message.

727
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,120
And stay safe and stay healthy.

728
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:24,760
Thank you.

729
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,200
Thanks for having me.

730
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,480
And we forgot to mention

731
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,720
that you also started a podcast in March.

732
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,960
I know we're out of time

733
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,680
but just give me two sentences on that.

734
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,200
I'll quickly say to follow me

735
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,640
on Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter,

736
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,920
Marissa Beth Orr.

737
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,520
B-E-T-H is my middle name.

738
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,560
And then I just started

739
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,000
a podcast in March called,

740
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,040
Nice Girls Don't Watch The Bachelor.

741
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,480
And that's meant to be irreverent.

742
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,400
It's a story

743
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,560
I can go into it another time.

744
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,040
But it's available on iTunes

745
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,760
and Google Play

746
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,960
and Everywhere Podcasts are.

747
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,520
So, thank you.

748
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,760
