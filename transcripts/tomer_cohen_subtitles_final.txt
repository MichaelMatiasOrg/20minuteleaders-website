Tomer Cohen, thank you for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? I'm great. How are you, Michael? Fantastic. So, you're calling me from Be'er Sheva next to Ben-Gurion University. And while you're finishing your undergraduate degree, it doesn't do justice that title to what you are actually even doing in Israel with Tech2Peace and dealing with one of the most extraordinary conflicts in history. Actually, a five thousand year conflict and making it very relevant to 2020, bringing technology and peace into the same equation. And I am very excited to spend the next 20 minutes or so talking to you about this conflict but specifically in the context of how can we leverage technology and commonalities and similarities to bridge some deeper rooted conflict. So Tomer, take us away. Tell me a little bit about yourself and what is Tech2Peace? So basically, my name is Tomer Cohen. I'm originally from Jerusalem. So I'm 27 years old, actually about to finish my bachelor's degree in geography and political science. Nothing to do with technology so far, even though in the army I served as a fighter in special units but actually it combines between Hi-Tech, a technology and actually combat role, so it was very it was the first very strong moment of the Hi-tech in my life in general. In my first year in my bachelor's degree, I actually established with two other founders Tech2Peace. Tech2Peace, what we basically do is to connect between young adults from Palestine and Israel between ages 20 to 26 by two things. The first thing basically is about learning technology. Like if it's programming or mobile ... development or AI for programmers and et cetera. Every participant for two week long seminar actually dedicated a lot of the time to study this subject and actually to build her own or his own project in addition to very intensive and very unique dialogue workshops that actually my partner Abeer, which is from East Jerusalem, and Uri from Haifa are actually doing. There we speak about everything, about personal experiences, about the history like Nakba and Yom Ha'atzmaut Independence Day and all those issues in two week long seminar. And actually, because what we're trying to do is to build new partnerships, new friendships and partnerships that can go for the long term. Amazing. So just, a little bit of context because a lot of the viewers are from, you know, from California, not everybody is aware of of the of the deepness and the complexity of this conflict. And I won't be able to do justice in the 10 second brief. But it essentially talks about the Middle East conflict, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It's much more than just territory. It's more than just culture. It's about history. It's about deep-rooted beliefs. It's about generations of hatred that have that have erupted to where we are today and an unresolved conflict that basically the whole world is trying to help or not help in one way or another. And so give me a little bit of what is this program? So it's two weeks where they come together. What have you noticed and actually I want to go back to how it started because that's a fascinating story that you started telling me before. So basically about how it started and what we basically actually do every day at Tech2Peace. So basically two years ago I met the two other co-founders Abeer, as I said, which is from East Jerusalem and Uri, he's from Haifa originally. And they actually told me about their work They actually was running an organization ... some Israelis maybe know this organization, but this is another unformal organization which actually combine between Palestinian like they connect between Palestinians and Israelis a full dialogue. Just to meet, being friends, and actually make, you know, the most significant connections. And they did it for almost 10 years. And like more than 450 Palestinians and Israelis actually met through this program ... And once I met them more two years ago, I was asking them, "Abeer, Uri, what do you think? How can we actually create bigger impact? How can we actually do something?" Yeah, exactly. How can we actually, because it's amazing when Palestinians and Israelis meet. But in order to actually try and do something very significant with the future of this region, maybe let's try other methods. And Uri told me that he worked for many years as a project manager in the Hi-tech industry in Israel. And I was about just finishing my role in one of the like ... companies. In Israel they actually like doing summer camps, of Hi-tech in Israel. And we thought, "Okay, let's maybe try and do something else. Let's maybe try to do dialogue seminars like dialogue camps let's say, with Hi-tech in the same time" That actually the participants will get the advantage to get better future and something practical for their life, basically. And the reason that we started with this model, basically, it's because of two main challenges you, basically you and the audience should know about. First of all, as you can guess, many of the people who already go to dialogue camp style of seminars between Palestinians and Israelis, those are the same convinced people. Yeah. Yeah. Like Israelis who are mainly from Tel Aviv and the Palestinians mainly from Ramallah, from the west part of Ramallah, and some other very specific places, but most of the people that actually go and meet, it's the convinced. And so we thought, "How can we bring new people, new people from the periphery of Israel, from the periphery of Palestine, from refugee camps, from like Bedouins from the Negev. How can we bring someone from Ashdod, from ... other places that are a bit far from Tel Aviv from the center?" And then we thought about, let's try and bring them something that actually they can use, something that all the participants will get out the benefit out of it. Right. Basically. And the second reason that we established Tech2Peace, the second challenge which you wanted to tackle basically, it was that in many peace camps and in many other seminars basically many times, not always, but many times there's no continuity. Right. And if the Palestinians and the Israelis basically act like at very significant moments and they became really good friends, probably once the seminar is over or the camp is over, the Palestinians go to their home. The Israelis go to their homes, and there is no continuity. There's no Is it possible to to create continuity in a matter of a two week program? Basically yes, because we sleep together, we eat together. At night they actually share their most intimate and the most personal stories with one another. They're having fun with one another. And in those moments of, after we finish the program around nine or ten PM those are the moments where the friendship actually create. And this is actually what we're trying to achieve besides all the very intense ... and this is what we do in the seminars, but other things that you and the audience actually should know about Tech2Peace, that once the seminar is over, all the participants become automatically alumni of Tech2Peace and they start the alumni program, which means before the Coronavirus like every one or two months actually meeting with experts, if it's from Google, fron Microsoft, sometimes from MIT, from other places in order to give them the additional value of after the seminar. Yeah. And sometimes also, of course, also dialogue to get in-depth into the issues that actually they talked during the seminars. And also between the 90 alumni of Tech2Peace that we have so far, 17 of them actually work on cross-border startups together. They just started a couple of months ago to work on cross-border startups with our amazing partners from Boston. It's called 50:50 startups. It's a new startup incubator. So it's very exciting. Wow. So at the end, how many people went through this? How many of these two week programs have you done so far since the inception of this? So the pilot seminar took place in 2018 in Yeruham, down south in very isolated small town. Actually Michael Biton who is now in the parliament, in the Israeli Knesset, he actually was the mayor of this small town, and he was very advocated in order to let us do the seminars in his town. And after the pilot seminar which we were surprised because no one think that actually what is the connection between Hi-tech and dialogue? But after we saw it actually it works we did other two seminars in the summer of 2019 and in this upcoming summer we're hopefully gonna do two or even three seminars. And that that's gonna be online I guess. Right? Basically no. It's actually, as far as the situation now, there is a very good chance that it will work out, But of course, no promises. It depends. Actually, I keep forgetting because I'm here. I'm here in California and the situation here is much different than it is back in the Middle East. So I'm very happy to hear that. So tell me a little bit about So you've had, and it's about 15 people each for each two week program? 30. 15 Palestinians, 15 Israelis So you've had about 90 people go through this thing so far. Tell me a little bit about what you've noticed about the the openness that you're contributing or so, you know, and I'm especially interested about the continuation of what do you see happening after the program with these participants? So basically, we try to find in terms of applicants before the seminars, before we accept the participants, we try and find people who actually have like kind of sense of who could be entrepreneurs. It doesn't have to be about Hi-tech. It could be also about social impact stuff. Of course, it could be also about ... the private sector also the public and also to work in the government one day. If it's about the Palestinian ... or in Israel, we look to find the people who actually want to be leaders one day. And enough open minded to listen to ideas and concepts that are really not used to hear. Right. If it's in the West Bank or in Israel. So this is what we try to find before the seminars and after the seminar, so it really depends. Those are you know, there are like alumni who really want to open startups so we actually help them to get inside like the partnership with the accelerator that we have in Boston And those who are most, you know, more thinking about getting into the Hi-tech we also nowadays try to find more solutions also for them with Microsoft and Cisco and other companies. So it really depends about the situation. Sure. And now let's go a little bit higher and broader. So this is now impacting, you know, a few dozen of people, few dozens of people per summer. How do you get this to scale? So at the end how do you get the two populations to have meaningful dialogue and not just in small groups? So the best and the easy thing for us is basically to do, to create more and more seminars. Like now we do two seminars a year. Hopefully because the demand. This year we, so far the application is still open, we got more than 400 applicants, 424 I think, for only 60 spots, spots for the summer. 90 if we will actually be able to do in the end three seminars instead of only two. And the demand exists, so we definitely look to do more seminars a year and in more concepts. For example, one of our partners, MIT, so now we talk about actually creating short, one week long seminar, which will focus only about mobile app development and dialogue. - Nice And also we talk about like doing another concept, a one week long seminar with Google, Google for startups, with the office in Tel Aviv. A one week long seminar which actually focus about dialogue and about entrepreneurship, actually how to build startups for those who are actually interested. And then we can also find other thousands, I guess, of applicants, new applicants ... try to be candidates for Tech2Peace because, you know, to take a vacation, a two-week long vacation, it's for many people it's a bit hard, mainly for people who must work all the year or in the summer vacation. So Right, that was my next question. At the end, everybody is busy and taking two weeks to form this dialogue and to be open and to learn, even to learn new things, even if it's disconnected from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, is very demanding. So how do you actually find this this balance and this win-win situation where people can balance it with their jobs? And do you think there's room to do things like this outside of a context of just a two week seminar, but throughout the year and throughout the life? So basically, basically if I got your question right, so definitely we can scale it much more. We can do much more seminars. We can create new concepts but similar to our concept. Basically, for example, now we collaborate with MIT about we're helping MISTI, it's the international department of MIT, to basically help them to implement Tech2Peace's model in other places worldwide and the first location hopefully going to be South Africa in Capetown with refugees and local youth. Yeah. So, you know, for me as a Jewish guy, for me, just you know, once it will also spread in other places around the world. For me, it's amazing example of Tikun Olam Yeah. Besides our region, we hopefully in a few years we're gonna have hundreds and then after that, thousands of alumni, that will go through the program. So you're you're definitely seeing this grow, grow at scale. Do you see yourself continuing to be a part of this full time over the years or do you see yourself slowly transitioning out and thinking about other ventures that you want to do? So it really depends because throughout the year, there are really really really tough moments. Three days before a seminar, when we also do not get sometimes the permits for the Palestinians to enter Israel. Wow. And we don't know if the seminar actually will take place as planned with the same participants or if it's about also now with the Coronavirus. Of course there's other NGO's. The budget is really suffering out of it. So there are very, very intensive and hard moments throughout the year, but you know for me as a co-founder, like, it's really hard to fall asleep at night. But on the other end when someone, Palestinian or Israeli, in the last day of the seminar come to me, you know, with a tear under the eye and actually say to me, "You know, this experience actually changed my life. This experience was so significant for me. So, so amazing I never thought that I gonna have a Palestinian friend" Or the Palestinian "I never thought that I gonna have an Israeli friend" Totally. So those moments of people and it happens a lot at Tech2Peace because it's very emotional and very connecting. I say to myself, "I do not wanna be out of it Never" But in the very hard night that I cannot fall asleep, of course I'm thinking about maybe it's too tough to do something so, so crazy. Because in this reality, it's not something usual to actually connect between Palestinians and Israelis. In our region of course, it's something, you know, in the United States, so sometimes, not nowadays of course, but in other times it's easier to bring people from different backgrounds. In the Middle East with all the suffer, with both sides, that many there are so many victims of both sides. There's so many suffering and so much history, so just bringing new people to be friends with people that they never thought they gonna be friends with and not for only two week long seminar. It's for months and hopefully years after. So those moments are the most significant. This is why I hope to continue doing this for a long time. Yeah. You know Tomer, I think that it's it's amazing because I think it's very easy from far away to take for granted this idea of bringing together people for dialogue. And, you know, just peaceful dialogue on friends with all the differences. And I think that it's it's just hard to grasp this idea that in the region where we're at in Israel and the Middle East in general, it's not that simple to get a Palestinian and an Israeli in the same room. It's not simple even logistically just passing the borders, putting aside all the personal differences and the fact that your friends are gonna think you're crazy and your family's gonna disown you potentially. It's a problem. And I think that being this catalyst and fostering this and allowing it to happen is something that's really remarkable. And I I've always said to my family and friends that I unfortunately have started losing faith in the current system of how we're trying to solve this. And my personal belief is that the only way this will be solved is if my generation, if our generation, can grow up more open minded. Visit the world. Talk to each other in a friendly way. Start putting aside 5000 years of differences, but focusing on the next five thousand years and potentially using technology to help bridge that gap and the similarities I think that would be wonderful. Unfortunately I can't believe 20 minutes are almost up but Tomer, I have know three words that best describe you. Oh It's challenging to choose It came by quickly. Yeah. I will try. Determined. I'm sometimes too much determined. Honest. I try to be honest to people as much as possible. It's also very Israeli thing to to be in that way. Yeah. I have other words. Multi-disciplinary. Maybe a bit impulsive. Maybe I love it. So I brought four different words. I hope you are okay with that. It's very Israeli of you I ask for three you give me four. That's a plus. Wonderful. Tomer, toda raba. Thank you for the inspiration and best of luck with Tech2Peace. It sounds amazing. Thank you so much, Michael. Great. Bye.
