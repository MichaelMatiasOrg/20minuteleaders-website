1 All right. Shuli Gilutz, thank you so much for joining me. Great to be here or there. Somewhere. Who knows anymore. Shuli, what does it mean to be an expert on Children’s User Experience in digital? What does that mean? It's a great question because I don't know if the word digital, like how that refers to user experience, but generally what we look at is how to design environments, digital environments, interactive environments for kids which are age appropriate. So, age appropriate design. It started out with a more cognitive focus in terms of learning and attention, but today we talk about social, relevance, and emotional and all these other challenges that we have in designing. So okay. So, when you talk about children, what demographic are you an expert on? Which demographic are we talking about? So children zero to 18 that's the legal boundaries. Even though research today talks about childhood ending at around 25. So - I'm still a kid! Great! - Sorry all those out there Finally, I have confirmation that I can be a kid again. Wonderful. You are. But legally 18. I guess it depends in different countries. Some countries legal age for different things varies. The US 21 for some things, but legally zero to 18. So you know it's such a confusing time, and it's such a fascinating time to think about this because I'm looking at all these social media apps that are arising. And it's incredible to see how, I'm 24. I consider myself a child still and a very young user, yet I use Facebook primarily then Instagram. I don’t really know what Tiktok is, but I heard that I'm supposed to be there. But it's crazy because already I feel illiterate when it comes to the usage of how young people use social media and interact with it overall. So, tell me a little bit about what is the study that you're doing? And what are the differences between the way that young people use these things versus the older generations like myself? So that's, exactly that's a great question because you would not be considered an old generation. You're a millennial. I mean you're the younger generation right? But what we see now is fascinating. I've been in this field for about 20 years. And we've always divided up kids to five age groups, right. So, you have your babies, your toddlers, early elementary, tweens, and teens. You'd think that that would be enough. But apparently, it's not because it turns out that every five years there's this jump in technology and what happens is is not that the children become smarter. Evolution doesn’t happen over five years it happens over millions of years. So what the difference is is that when they're born with certain technologies as a baseline, they start from there, and that's what the minimum they expect everything to work in a certain way. So, you can even see with kids today, like I have two children one is 13 and one is almost 10. So my 13 year old, when he searches, goes primarily to text based search, YouTube, other place. My 10-year-old, when she was very young when she was four, YouTube Kids came out. And I showed it to her. And it has voice search. So she would go, "Elsa." and it would play Let It Go whatever. She uses voice search today. She can write. She could do anything. It's a very, it just opened kind of a gap. And he never uses voice search. Why would he use voice search? He could type. But he's 13. So, you see already those a few years have very different behaviors and we see that with voice a lot today. Kids growing up with Alexa at home, and Google home, and Siri, they treat voice very naturally, while kids who are just a few years older and old 20-year olds like yourself, are like, "Okay. Maybe I'll use Siri here. Maybe I'll use voice there" But younger kids, it's just so natural to them because it was always there. Like their Legos and like their other books. It was even there before they were able to read and write, they were able to speak and therefore if that's an option on YouTube Kids then that becomes their default way. Exactly. And they're just used to it. And when adults use it, they are like "Okay. What should I say? What's the command? What's the right thing to do?" Yeah. I think that's fascinating because it's been, it must be already a few years. My father is at Google and I've seen him talk to his Google assistant and I hate voice. I can’t do voice. I don't do the right command. My phone doesn’t understand me. I feel so old when it comes to these. So, now I'm thinking that he's a revolutionary that in his great age and he's been using it for years. But it makes sense that the new generations, that's what they're gonna be adapted to. So, this is where we should capitalize. So, what else? What other - But I have to say though, in defense of your father, who is not a typical in his generation I would say. But actually voice is very big with the older generation, with older adults because it, again, allows them to do things that maybe is harder for them in other ways. So, they are actually early adopters in that area which is really interesting. I mean there are a lot of parodies if you've seen the SNL ones and others, but voice is very big. And in many ways I have this colleague who talks about designing for older adults and a lot of times we find ourselves together in conferences. Me talking about kids and him talking about older adults - Oh, that's awesome. - ... there's a lot of similarities Oh, that is so cool. Yeah. Very interesting. But the thing about kids is that they're not afraid. So, that's why kids are such great learners. They take a phone and say, "Hmn, what will happen if I put this in the toilet? You know that would be cool." And the parents are like, "Aaahh." And they put it in and then you have to put it in rice and whatever. Just so you know, rice works. But they're curious and they try everything. So, when you try everything you figure it out. That's how you learn the best. When you're like, "Oh my God, what will I press? What do I do?" Then you don't learn anything. Then it's much slow. It's not that they're smarter. It's just they're more open. They're not afraid. They don't care that it costs so much. That's why they're great learners. And especially with technology, and also the fact that they're not, especially the younger kids, they're not really aware to what we mean by technology. Like if you talk to young children, you ask them, "You know, what's your favorite technology?" They would be like, "The refrigerator. The car." Technology's everywhere. Right? The distinction between digital, that's what I said UX digital, and non-digital is a very old distinction. It's an adult thing. 'cause you work in high tech. Whatever that means. They don't care you're creating stuff for fun, for game, for learning, for play. They don't care if Lego has sensor or it doesn’t have sensors. Is it a fun game? Yeah. That's what they care about. So, these distinctions are very like top down and very adult and not relevant to their lives. They are looking at the final product and it's pure UX. Like what's the experience here? Is it a great learning experience? Is it a fun experience? Is it motivating? Do they wanna play it more? They don’t care if it has sensors, or digital or whatever in it or not. Right. So, you're teaching at Shenkar and Tel Aviv University. And what do you focus on? And what do entrepreneurs today who are building products that are going to be used by kids or other demographics, is this something that they need to keep in mind and really understand the different user experiences? Is there a really clear distinction? Yeah. I think that's two different things. I think students at Tel Aviv University and Shenkar, they're very interested in this. They see what's happening around them. They can tell the difference. They don't really know how to gauge it exactly. You know, are people are into Minecraft or Fortnite these days? Or is it Tiktok or Snapchat. Like, what's going on? And it's fine and it's exciting. But I think, the important thing for entrepreneurs is really to understand that there's a variety of kids. I've worked with so many companies that come and say, "Okay my kid, they love reading on an iPad so I'll develop a blah blah blah blah" Okay. Let's see what their age group. You know how many kids, what's developmentally appropriate? So there are all these myths that we really have to do ... user research to, but like with any other UX and any other product, to tease them apart. There are a lot of myths about kids and technology. And unfortunately, the biggest one is screen time. Everybody is afraid of screen time especially in the valley. And I think it's really interesting because there is no such thing as screen time. If you look at, I gave my kids 20 minutes of screen time today. What does that mean? Were they watching 20 minutes of Sesame Street? National Geographic? Or porn? Were they watching reality TV or sports? Was it Dora? What does that even mean? It's like you would never, you know in a book or any other game, it's about the content and then the context. What are the alternatives? Now 20 minutes of screen time can mean talking to grandma. You know because you can’t go visit her. So is screen bad? Right. So it's really about the content, the context, and the alternative. Right? And also the specific child. What's the age group? What are their capabilities? What do they need in their lives? So, I think by boxing it all on screen time, we're really doing a disservice for our kids. And also, we're kind of not looking at ourselves because as the adults around the kids, we're on this thing all the time. Not 20 minutes. Not 20 hours, but 24 hours 24/7. And there's so many surveys to show that. So, these kids are growing up in a very different childhood than you grew up in, than I grew up in for sure where everybody's connected all the time, and they wanna be like the adults around them. So, it's not fair to judge them and say "Oh, but when I was a kid we use to play outside all the time." Right. Because you didn’t have this super computer library in your pocket all the time and neither did your parents. or your siblings, or your friends, and everybody else. Very different childhoods especially 2020. This, everything's changed - - This acceleration is amazing. Right. I mean amazing in the sense that it's remarkable. I don't know if it's, I don’t know what it's going to be on kids. But one of the things that I’m curious about, so we talked about this trend that kids are much more into experimentation and as the generations grow older, the will or the excitement about experimentation decreases or there's an increased anxiety or fear. Are there other key differences that you've noticed between the usage of kids versus the usage of adults? And something that product designers or entrepreneurs can keep in mind as they're designing their products for the different demographics? Yes. Definitely. So, number one I think the most important one is motivation. So when you're designing a product for adults, your motivations are a lot of times utility. You wanna be efficient, you wanna get time on task is a measure. You check your ROI according to how much time you saving, how much money you're saving. With kids, it's just not the case. Again, it depends on the age group, the content, and the context, but a lot of times, kids are using technology for fun, for entertainment, for learning. They will spend an hour watching something that you think is not of value but for them it's huge. And if you really wanna empower them, and give them the ability to create like drawings, so if they're drawing a ... if they're creating stop-motion animation or if they're creating video games that they're programming. That will take hours. So, it's not about efficiency which is very important. It's a very different thing when you're doing UX for adults. Efficiency is a very big thing. So motivation, intrinsic motivation, things that I'm passionate about while adults a lot of times have external motivation. Things for work. Changes the ability. There was a bid trend of gamification a few years ago. I think that's gone down a bit 'cause people understand that once you're doing things for badges and leaderboards and stars, that becomes the motivation and you forget about what you're actually loving to do. So, even in places like Khan academy and places that have really kind of novel ways to treat education are doing great things, they've lowered the gamification of it - Really? so the focus is still the content. So, gamification works. No doubt about it. It works. - 100% It just changes the focus from the content So for different people it does different things. Interesting. But I do have to say that I was looking for motivation to finish a course on Khan Academy back when I was in high school. And I was doing self-study for advanced math. And the fact that I had those badges and I had that streak. All of sudden it kept me from exiting a video because I knew that if I just listened to the last two minutes, which are always important because that's where you usually have the summary, but we think, every kid thinks he's the smartest kid in the world. So you think "Ah I don’t need to listen to the summary. I got it" But I wouldn’t have received my extra 90 tokens if I didn’t stay on. So I stayed on and I'm very thankful that I did that. Shuli, talk to me a little bit about your work. What does it mean to be an expert on user experience for kids? Do you work with startups? Do you teach? How does it work? So okay. So, I have a few different bits to my work. I'm very inter-disciplinary I got one foot in academia one foot in industry. I don’t really fit anywhere. But I really enjoy it 'cause I love theory and I love research and I love thinking about products that just benefit kids without have to thinking about marketing, sales, and all of that stuff. However, I like doing things in the real world that actually reach kids too. So trying to do both. I consult companies who develop products for kids. These could be AR, VR, and apps like digital TV apps. Or now I'm working with a company that's developing an online platform for education. So, when they're doing these products we do the full UX process. So we think about who are the stakeholders? Who are the users? Where are their painpoints, the ... the journey, but we do add the unique factors of designing for kids and for families which go together with designing for Children's Rights which is another organization I'm part of. And thinking about what this affords them? What this really gives them? More than only what they need 'cause needs is again, it's a very adult kind of a word, our painpoints, that means you have a goal and you have an efficiency and so forth. And there are also some legal considerations of course to consider, data, privacy, security, when you're designing for kids which are slightly different again, depending on the different age groups. When you said the word children’s rights immediately my thought was How do you design responsibly for kids, not just in terms of the legal aspect on the data and privacy, but also in terms of, it's much easier I think, I'm assuming, to get a kid addicted to something than it is to get an adult addicted because the adult has those firewalls, those internal firewalls, that tell them "Uh-Oh, I'm actually spending too much time here or I'm not doing the right thing" A kid may not have that. So, what is the responsibility here in terms of understanding how to design responsibly for kids? So, ethics are big. So, you hit the point. I mean adults have that or not, but we can’t, they're adults. They can do whatever they want. We do have legal protection for different things, from gambling to other things, but we know that there are ways you could use dark UX to create addictions and so forth. Now, for kids that's worse because - I like that term. Dark UX. Dark UX. There you go. Look it up. You'll find creepy stuff. But for kids, especially younger kids, they don’t even know that some things are ads. I mean I had this conversation with my son a few years ago when one of his favorite youtubers was showing him something with Lego or Minecraft I don't remember. And I told him, "Well you know he gets paid for that." He looked at me he's like, "What?" I said, "Yeah, you know they're promoting it." And I said, "You know I like this youtuber. I really do. He's awesome. He picks really good products. I like the way he does stuff. That's why I let you watch him, but you should know that Lego paid him to go to Legoland to get this stuff." He started crying and he's like, "How can you say that? This is just what he loves." So we had now, of course, my kids, they're involved in my career. So they know what’s going on. But a lot of kids don’t. You know they believe that these influencers are passionate about this stuff. Now, some of the stuff that youtubers pull are awesome. A lot of environmental stuff, a lot of great stuff. But they are promoters of all kinds of efforts and there's no way, and TV, in linear TV, there used to be "We'll be back after these messages" Right? When you were watching a show and you were going to commercials. That was a way to tell children okay, the cartoons you're seeing now are ads. The cartoons you saw before are content 'cause how would they distinguish it they have the same characters. There's a Spiderman here and Spiderman there. It’s the same. In internet and digital, we don’t have that linear experience. So you have to be very responsible. There's a lot going on in terms of ads and kids’ apps, and paid stuff, and different models for it. But yeah, you have to be aware of these things and think about it, and think about what kind of experience you want to create for your users ethically not only legally. I think two things came to mind when you were giving that example of my beautiful niece who's now five years old but this is already relevant from when she was three that she would watch these unboxing videos on YouTube. And when I saw that, I thought it was the most ridiculous thing. I couldn’t believe that we're watching another kid unbox a toy now. And then I looked at how many views and it had a billion views. It was one of the most popular videos on YouTube. And then every time on YouTube there was the ads that come up in the middle. She would go furious. She would say, "I don’t understand. How do I exit out of this? How do I skip?" And I thought it was just incredible because I grew up Saturday morning I go to the TV, and I watch my cartoons and I wait. And I wait for the cartoons and whatever happens happens. Right. But that's a great point because first of all the cartoon thing, yeah they don’t get the whole why do we have to wait and why do I have to watch? But the adults don’t get it either. So, they're good. They're along with everything. But the thing about the unboxing and there's a lot been written about that but it's really cool. So if you think about play patterns. Play patterns don’t change across media, but if you think about peek-a-boo, right, it's the same thing. It's unboxing. So, you're just walking and, "Wow! Surprise!" And then another one. "Wow! And I wonder what's gonna be in there now." So, it's so exciting. We call it unboxing because we have no clue what's going on there. But for them it's just a surprise show after surprise after surprise which is really cool. You know how when kids get gifts they say that the box part is the best part they play with the cardboard. - Yeah! That's it. Over and over again. It's amazing. It's perfect. That is so so cool. Are there different things that we should be worried about with the way that generations are moving and interacting with technology? Should I be worried about some of the things that my niece is going to experience different from the way I will whether in terms of social interactions, or personal fulfillment, or emotional intelligence? Well yeah, but it's hard to say what. So I think the problem with that is that a lot of parents today don’t know what their kids are doing. They can’t deal with it. Parenting is hard. You're parenting, your kids are doing stuff you haven’t done when you were a kid. They're not watching Saturday morning cartoons anymore, or maybe they are but they're doing a million other things. And so, you have to learn what they're doing. What's right and wrong. What's going on. It's really really difficult. So, a lot of parents are like just do whatever you need to do. Let me know if I have to buy something. And that's a bit problematic because you would never let your kid just go around the street and go to people you don’t know. And there could be things that are not for them or dangerous. Or even if you let them play like I had a mom, I talked about Fortnite and how I thought it was actually a pretty cool game for tweens. And she was so angry and she said "You know my kid you should see him after he plays eight hours of Fortnite. He's like a zombie." And I'm like, "Why is he playing eight hours of Fortnite?" One hour. Two hours. With his friends that's awesome. It's a game that has diversity. You play with groups. You're assigned gender and ethnicity, random. There's no blood. There's sweet little cute animals. There's dances. Eight hours? Like eight hours? So and I think, 'cause she's like, "Ah, yeah he's playing with his friends" So, I think the problem for the kids is not the technology per se, but the problem is the parents are kind of stuck. They don’t know. They don’t know enough about when to say yes. They have to sit down and play with their kids. They have to know what Fortnite really is. What Minecraft really is. And then they’ll know how to parent it. Like they do with anything else. There’s no other way because it keeps changing. It's like you said about Tiktok. Today it's Tiktok. Two years ago it was Snapchat. Two years ago it was something else. It's gonna be something else soon 'cause too many adults are in Tiktok. The teens are gonna leave. They don’t want adults there. Really, adults are going on Tiktok? Oh yeah. All these moms are trying to be cool. And all these companies are trying to use Tiktok as a platform for products of course. So, the minute that happens you know it's gonna shift soon in some way. But the thing is that, parents have to know. So, my advice would be just sit down and play. Don’t read articles whatever. Just sit down and play with your kids. Just see what's going on. What do they do? They'll love it. They wanna talk to you about these things. Fascinating. And if they're at the point where they don’t, where they’re teens already, that's difficult. But still, be there with them. Just show them you care. Show them that you're into it 'cause once you dismiss it all as screen time or "Oh c'mon I don’t understand about that" then you're just creating a bigger gap and it's harder to parent that way. 100%. Shuli, 20 minutes go by so so fast, but I have to ask you the most important question. Three words that best describe you. ... okay. One I guess it would be interdisciplinary because I don’t know what I do. The other one would be curious 'cause I'm always interested in what’s going on. And the last one would be an optimist because I really believe it's all good, and it's gonna better Wow. Most people when they talk about this the way that kids interact with technology and the addiction, they're very, they're on the opposite spectrum of optimism. Because they haven’t talked to kids. You know what, that's what I love about what I do. I get to sit and talk to them, and play with them, and they’re the best. That's amazing. Shuli, toda raba. Thank you very very much. Toda. Stay safe and stay healthy. Thanks. Bye.
