1 But the people you can really learn from are the people who are somewhat disappointed if they can't, if they couldn't use your product every day. Nadia Tatlow, thank you so much for being on my show. How are you? Good. Nice to meet you finally. Definitely. Thank you for being here. Vast experience in PR and marketing, the CEO of Shift. I want to go back before we get into your professional journey. Where do you come from and how do you go on your journey wanting to become at the end the CEO of a startup? Yeah, I guess so. So, I am Canadian, based in Victoria, BC. And that's where Shift is, has been founded and grown from day one. So, the whole team is based here on the West Coast. My background, I actually moved to Victoria about seven years ago from Toronto. So, I did my undergrad and schooling at Queen's University in Kingston. And years before that I had moved around a lot growing up with my family. So, I think I've always been very entrepreneurial about the way I approach work. And that's kind of been a theme from day one for me. I've also, I think, lived in a lot of different places, and that has influenced a lot about, I think, the way I work and the way I want to work, and just how I think about work in general. So, I think, yeah, when I found Victoria, to be honest, I moved here because I thought it was such a beautiful city. I have some family here. So, there is that was kind of calling me from moving across the country in my 20s. So, yeah, I think wanting to be able to live in Victoria and build a company and sort of achieve all the things in my career that I want to do. It seemed like a kind of an awesome opportunity when I originally took a job out on Victoria to start building that out. And yeah, I couldn't be happier to be here, I'd said. It's not a bad place to be even. Even through this covid and pandemic stuff we're all going through. So, how do you find yourself? You're starting with PR and marketing. You've held several positions in that world before initiating Shifts. So, what was it about that industry that interested you? And why made the transition later on to becoming the CEO of Shift? Yeah. So I guess the reason I got into PR, I remember the first time I heard what public relations was, I was actually doing a, in university, I took a summer job at a daycare like a Montessori daycare. And I got chatting with one of the parents that I just seemed kind of like a cool guy. And I remember he had founded his own PR consulting business. And so, that was really my first time getting any introduction to what PR was. I did my undergrad in political science. So, and I love talking about politics. I love that world of. So I, but I often realized I was graduating post 2008 and realizing political science wasn't the direct path into the kind of job that I wanted to get. So, after talking to him, I remember thinking, you know what, this is such an amazing kind of introduction into business. And I think a lot about business comes down to PR. And whether it's kind of business PR and brand PR or personal PR, it's all very important. And also telling the story and the narrative about your work or your company or yourself is so critical to success. So, I decided to do a postgrad program in public relations. Met a bunch of amazing people through that. And it was a great network to jumpstart my career. So, that launched me into working at a marketing agency in Toronto, which I really enjoyed. But ultimately, I think I saw myself moving more into the product side. I think I saw the highs and lows of what it is to work in an agency and you learn a lot and you move fast and you really learn of the service role and you get to exposure to so many cool brands and products. But I think I realized pretty quickly that I wanted to build something of my own and really kind of be the person behind the brand rather than kind of serving someone else's. So, there comes Shift. So, what is Shift? What are you trying to do there? So Shift, I think in the shortest amount of words is a browser for work. So, we started shift about three years ago. Really as a really solving for the pain point of multiple email accounts. So, and there's a little bit of back story in that. Shift actually spun out of a company I was working at. So, I was managing marketing across a bunch of different brands at a company here in Victoria. And there are a few of us that sort of would jump on a project every time we had a new idea to, or a product idea, we would sort of fire up nadia@, whatever this new product idea was. So, domain and email, and that meant calendar, and drive associated with each of those. So, we were very much in this world of multiple email accounts. Like I think I had seven or eight at the time we launched Shift. So, that's one side of the workflow pain point that we were solving for. But we approached Shift from day one as we have this pain point ourselves. Let's build something to solve for this and then see the reaction and the response and sort of build iteratively on the product from there. So, almost as soon as we launched Shift, we started getting feedback that people, like this is amazing, I also have this pain point. A lot of people working in design or marketing or consulting businesses where they also kind of lived the same experience as us. And then they, but they also often had extensions and apps. And basically all these other things they were doing at work in the browser that they wanted to move out. So, that really fired up our engine and told us that we had early signal of product market fit. And that really kind of the vision for Shift was much, much bigger than an email service that was really a browser for work. So, when you say browser for work, what does it actually mean tangibly? If I go to Shift right now, what would I see? Yeah, so, you can download Shift at tryshift.com It's a downloadable desktop app. So, it sits on your computer, just like if you use the Slack's desktop app It's a similar download experience. So, basically, it's built on the electron framework, which is actually the same framework that Slack is built on. And you download it for free, you set it up, and then we have a premium experience that you can upgrade to if you decide you need all the apps and all the extensions, unified search, workspaces, all that. So really, the way I look at it is most of us now will operate throughout our workday with a browser open at all times. And everyone has a very different workflow. Some people open multiple browser windows to organize their workflow. Some people actually have the, are consistent about Gmail profiles, and that's amazing if you are. And so, they'll organize work and personal and whatever else they do by Gmail profiles. Other people will use multiple browsers. So Safari, Chrome, Edge, whatever it is that you like. But what we found is that this workflow experience is very different for everyone. And there's no one way that everyone likes to work and is consistent about working. So, we want to kind of give you this flexibility with Shift, but also spoon feed you a much more organized, sort of streamlined experience so you can actually get work done and stop having to do the administrative, like there's a lot of buzz about there, out there, about work about work. So, trying to remove that work about work for you, so that you can actually do focused work and kind of eliminate distractions. So, if you're looking at your insights into the product and it's interesting because you say you transition from PR and marketing [--] and more towards the product, and then, really going through that entrepreneur process of finding product market fit, doing the spinning off of different products, pivoting and then finding your sweet spot. What were some of your aha moments along the way with Shift that you set up? I now understand, I have an insight that a lot of others may not have right now. Yeah, I think that's an interesting one. I think it's been very, like sometimes I think about the way we approach the business very much as horse before the cart. So, I think my background in marketing and the company that we spun out of, it was very much along the performance minded when it came to marketing. So, prove that there's product market fit before you overinvest in building a cart that might not solve the right problem. So, it was an aha moment when, and probably the biggest aha moment in the early days when our customers started asking for, and very early customers started asking for extensions and apps. And basically, okay, this is we want more than just email. Email's kind of a focus point, but it's not, it's not our entire workday. So, they were asking for that. And you always have to balance out, I think, running a company, how much you listen to customers, and how long you wait, and how many requests for something. Especially in the early days, you need to pile up before you really take action. But it was so clear. So, that was aha moment very early on, I think, I think now what we're working on is really more focused on how to help people work better together in Shift. So this has been another really, I think aha moment. We all have our workflows and sort of our, I think our individual work styles. And with Shift, it's interesting because we talk a lot about tab hoarding and sort of that mess that can pile up on your computer that you actually don't want anyone else to see. I'm looking at that mess right now. Yeah. I mean, by the end of a workday, with you're at, I guess, you could have dozens of tabs, open windows, and you don't even know where your day started or ended. Yeah, and then that's a pretty common. [--] you just close all of them because you would just want to start scratch. You don't even want to understand what you had over there. It's awful. Every day the same thing. Totally. Yeah. And I think that's so common. But there's also sign of sort of some shame around that. So, we wanted to help people streamline that and also sort of better prepare themselves for when you're, especially with all this work from home stuff. When you're jumping on a video call with someone and then all of a sudden they want you to share your screen, and you want to look and feel prepared. So, we built a layer on Shift called, workspaces. And essentially you can think of that as like a focused collection of tabs, apps, bookmarks, that you would actually want to work with someone else on. So, you can easily just share it with your collaborators, and then there you go. You've got this clean place to get stuff done. So, that was a big aha moment, too. Is that as individual as your personal workflow every day is, we don't work in silos. Most of us don't work by ourselves. And I think the more we work from home, and the more we're forced to do Zoom for everything, the more we kind of have to put purpose back in in the way we work together. Right. I think it's really interesting. One of the things that I was fascinated by this past year, in one of my classes at Stanford, we read a case study about Superhuman, by Rahul, in a first round magazine. And it was talking about how he found his sort of NPS score, and how he figured out who are his target customers and how to accelerate their growth in certain areas of his company to target those customers. Do you have any process that you're thinking through: how do I understand, how do I cluster my customers, and how do I really make sure I maximize on those that really love our product? Yeah. That's interesting. I think Superhuman has done an amazing job of that and of understanding their core audience and in speaking to them. Even the onboarding flow that they did and the fact that it's really all, they force the word of mouth. Like, I think, I think you still have to have an introduction to their team in order to get Superhuman. So, you can't even just download it, right? Which is really interesting. And it really allows for that word of mouth, but across the Internet to feel a lot more authentic. So, what we do is we really, I mean, we definitely see demographic consistencies and groupings of people that we know Shift will really speak to. But I think our audiences is very, very broad. And the more diverse and broadly we can speak to people, the better. So, we do things like, there are surveys within Shift where we we ask things about job title and an industry, so that we can better understand and better cater to each of those people. We end up seeing a lot of, I think millennials are a huge part of our core audience because so many of us have a work life, maybe a side hustle and a personal life that all a lot of those part of those lives happen on the Internet. So, you have email accounts and calendars and apps that go with each one. So, helping people organize and make sense of that work life balance that I think we're all trying to achieve. So, we see consistency with that. But with the onboarding process and even NPS scores, actually Superhuman did a really interesting survey of their users that we also, we saw in and ended up using for our customer base as well, where they asked the customer base: how disappointed would you be if you no longer had whatever products of Superhuman or Shift? And that was awesome. Because it's kind of, the results, we actually got the exact same results with our audiences as he had laid out in his article about it, where I think it was 25% of people were very disappointed if no Shift, 50% were somewhat disappointed and 25% were not disappointed. And those results have been for a lot of what we do and who we do it for. The key point that really stuck with me with that is that you're always going to have this 25%, well, you're not always, but you really are amazed by this 25% kind of super fans. And we get those ambassadors that Shift is their daily driver and they can't live without it. And we love those people. And we love talking to those people and getting their feedback. But the people you can really learn from are the people who are somewhat disappointed if they can't, if they couldn't use your product every day. So, really kind of digging into where that somewhat came from, has been a great or very informative exercise for us. I think one of the things that I took away from during that exploration and understanding, and as a Superhuman fan myself, it was about understanding that it's okay to sort of give up on certain groups and focus on others. And I think it's almost intuitive for us to see that there is a group that really doesn't care. And you're almost insulted that they don't care. So, you want to work to win their validity and get them to join you. And you sort of and you don't realize that they might not be the right group to maximize your efforts. And especially if you're a fast growing early stage startup, you can only focus so much of your energy on certain areas. And it's definitely important to know where to focus them. What has been the most challenging and most rewarding part of this journey for you? And one of the things that I wanted to bring up that we didn't get to discuss was, you didn't actually start out as the CEO of Shift, right? You started out as a general manager there. You've proven yourself, and then, you became the CEO. But what were some of the biggest challenges and rewards along the way? Yeah. I think the challenges are kind of tied into exactly what you just said, which is, especially with Shift, like our audience is basically anyone who uses a browser at work all day, which is all of us. And we can prioritize the way we approach customer acquisition, which is really a big part of our competitive edge and how we've really grown as fast as we had. So, I think, I think it's segmenting your audience when you have them. It's very exciting to have a massive audience. It's also a huge technological or technical challenge. But it's really, you know, finding ways to spice and dice that audience so you can tackle the most important pieces first and speak to the most important audiences first. So now I think three years in, it's fun to be able to have a core engine of people that we know we can reach and reach very efficiently. But then consistently sort of layer on and broaden who we speak to and how we speak to them. So, that's a big focus right now, is is really broadening that. Second part of your question, what was the other part? Sorry? The rewards. Some of the most rewarding moments. Yeah. The rewarding part about it is, I think, building a team. Like building a team is so critical to, I mean, ultimately, you go from kind of doing everything yourself with a couple other people. And then really sort of hiring the people who are ultimately going to build the product in the later stages. So, I think, it's rewarding and challenging, but I think a lot about the creator, the builder and the optimizer and where we're at now. Where we have a significant customer base of people that are using Shift every day to drive their workday. We have a lot of responsibility to those people. So, there's a ton of optimizations and bug fixes and requests and customer success, targets that we're dealing with all day. So, that is a huge part of the business now that we have this responsibility to these customers year over year. But you have to just keep creating and you have to keep building. So, balancing that out. And then I think ultimately identifying people on your team as one of those or some combination of those. It's definitely not black and white. And people evolve over time. But at the stage we're at, we do need all three of those. And I think there is, it's exciting because there's so much opportunity for everyone on the team to sort of evolve into the positions that are best for them and sort of grow with the company. So, yeah, I think, that's rewarding and that's rewarding for me. I think a lot about it as almost manifesting our own growth trajectory and manifesting what we want out of our own career, which has always been sort of my driving force. 100%. I think that's just wonderful. I want to thank you for being so generous with your time. 20 minutes go by very, very fast. And I really appreciate you taking time to do this. Before we leave, I have to put you on the spot one time, and I have to ask you for three words that you would use to describe yourself. Or if I ask anybody that is working with you or for you, what are three words that they would use to describe Nadia? I think, probably excitable, open minded and hardworking. I love it. Nadia, thank you so, so much. This is really great. And I can't wait to share this with the world. Thank you so much, Michael.
