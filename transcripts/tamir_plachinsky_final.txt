1 We thought that we understood when we started this journey that, okay, cars are very expensive, let's design a cheaper car, you know. There are many, many other challenges in racing and we learn them mainly by operating a racing series. Tamir Plachinsky, thank you for joining me on to the leaders. Good afternoon to both of us. Thank you. Happy to be here. Okay. Before we start, I need you to tell me about this background. What am I seeing here? Yeah. It's cool ah. What you see is the different user interfaces of our data platform, which we call ramp. A data platform developed for motorsports. This is what Griiip is now involved in focusing in the different screens. So, in order for me to even begin to try and understand what I'm seeing here, like I mentioned before we started, I don't know the difference between the Toyota and the KIA and Hyundai. To me, they're all bare metals on four wheels that get me from point A to point B, but I really appreciate people that have a passion for it. So, Tamir, tell me, before we start talking about racing cars, how do you get started with an industry like this? What type of upbringing do you have where you get so passionate about race cars? Yeah. So, the key word here is exactly what you said. It's passion. And you cannot describe or explain passion. Either you have it or either you don't. And a lot of people in the world apparently have this kind of passion for cars, for driving, for driving fast, for the adrenaline, for the excitement, racing, motorsport, all those things, which exist in motorsport. Motorsport is like the sport for those who love driving and cars and everything. And I think for me personally, it's something that I have since I can remember since I was a little boy. And growing up in Israel, being passionate about motorsport is not a very nice thing to do because in the Israel, there is no motorsport. That was I was about to ask. Right. I don't see, you know, I just came back from Dubai. Every second street I go there's a line up of Ferraris and Lamborghinis. I don't remember seeing even a single Lamborghini here in Israel. Yeah. Those exotic sports cars are one thing, but you don't have any motorsport culture in Israel. It's like you don't have race or race car manufacturers or industry or anything like that. That actually, it was illegal until around 2015. So, in Israel, you only see that in the news and in newspapers and TV, but you don't really get to be involved in such an activity. And that's something I've always wanted to do. So growing up, I had the dream to become a world champion. That was my dream, driving something motorcycle, race car or whatever. But you come to the understanding that when you're 21, after, you know, serving in the military, it's a bit late to start your career. So I went to study mechanical engineering in the university with the dream to get to become involved in the industry. I described it to myself back then as being involved in the automotive industry. And I wanted to go to Italy. That was like a country I saw as the best place to go and do that. Ferrari or Lamborghini, I didn't really care. And then it became reality when during my studies I started the formula student team. It's like a team of students developing race cars for a student competition. You race against other universities. Wow. I started the first team in Israel back in 2010. And then we went to an event in Italy with the team. It was totally underground project. No one in the university really knew knew what we were doing. We tested the car in an abandoned parking lots at night. It was really one day will do and we will make a movie on that here. And then going to Italy for the event I met the main sponsor of the competition was a race car company from Italy and they offered me a job. So, I fulfilled my dream and I went to work in motorsport and race car manufacturer. The best one in the world, called Dallara. Spent six months living the dream completely, as you can imagine. And then coming back to Israel, i was so hyped about, okay, I know what I want to do. I love racing. I love race car. Let's do something in Israel in motorsport. And I saw only advantages in the fact that there is no industry in Israel in motorsport. You can only, if you have no constraints, you can do whatever you want. 100%. Right. Tamir, before we continue, I have to get a little bit of a better understanding about motorsports as an industry even before we get to to what you're doing with Griiip. Because to an outsider, all I can think about is that in some places there was a race cars. There's these crazy people that get into these crazy fast cars that are driving around in circles to beat the fastest time. What is this industry all about? What is the excitement? Give me some numbers. Who is the audience? What does it take to get there? I really am curious about this. Yeah. That's a good question. So, motor sport is probably, I think I won't offend anyone by saying that it's the most complex sport in the world. You don't only have the athlete, you have also the machine. And it's about the man machine integration that eventually win this. And it's harder to understand as a viewer, as a fan. Because it's not like you have a ball. You need to throw it, you have a score. This is a, it's more complex. You need to understand why this driver is faster than the other. There are a lot, a lot of things that you don't catch with the untrained eye. And also you have, let's say in a race, 10, 20, 50 cars, it doesn't matter the number, but as the number of cars are the number of potential events happening every second. On a football game or basketball, you have one ball. All the eyes are looking at that ball. And what happened with the ball is the event going on. In a race, you have a lot of cars. Everyone can do something. So, you have many balls. So, it's much difficult to understand. But still watching cars going fast on a track, it's a very exciting thing. That the battle, you know that it's the risk factor back then when it started and make the sport much, very much like gave the interesting factor to it. You know they are risking their lives. And unfortunately, we can still see drivers getting hurt on the track, even though safety became much, much better than it was used to be. But the combination of speed and risk and sound and everything is like a spectacular, like no other sport, at least in my mind. But being that complex with the facilities and the cars or motorcycles and everything, it's a very expensive sport. And that's like a big, big negative thing for the industry because you always want to have as many drivers and as many people participating. But there is the money barrier in motorsport that you need to have a lot of money. Money plays a very big role in motorsports. Right? You actually surprised me when I talked about the, the human machine integration that that is a key to success. And I always imagined that, you know, yeah, you have the top players, the top athletes. I didn't even think of them as athletes. I thought of them, okay, they're really great hand eye coordination, and then whoever gets the best car wins. But what you're saying is that it actually it's the combination of the car specs and the driver's specific skill sets that if they're aligned, that's what is causing the special circumstance. Right? It's not just that if the car is better then that's it, they win. Yeah. Yeah. If you look at the different racing series in the world, that balance varies from, let's say, Formula One, there are different manufacturers. And we look at Formula One as a series where the car has more effect on the final result result. If you look at lower tier series, let's say even what we call single maker series where all the cars are identical, but you can still do different setups for the car. So that's where the drivers talent comes. That makes a lot of sense. So, I'm looking at a dashboard. And I have no idea why we would need a dashboard for motor racing industry. Tell me about this. Of course, I'm teasing when I say that I, that there are lot of the things that I don't understand. But it's too complicated for me to understand, but I wish I understood it better. So, I think, by the way, this dashboard as like a mirror. Because I think, I see the English they're brights up. I think I'm seeing it okay. Yeah. So it's like, uh, I'm sitting behind it. I know it's something in the front. I will explain the dashboard by continuing like this short history about Griiip. So, Griiip, when I came back to Israel, I started Griiip as a brand to make motor sport more accessible. I just finished my last explanation saying that it's very expensive. And that's where we saw Griiip comes in the market offering something different. Like we wanted to give more people opportunity to participate. And we started maybe not in the most common place to start, but we started with the driver. And we said, okay, let's give the driver a better solution to race, a more cost effective solution. So we started by designing a race car. It's not a very simple thing to do for a small startup. Small startup from a country with no motor sport, with no racetracks, with no knowledge. It was pretty intense. But, you know, you set up to do something and you are very determined, so, that's what you do. And we eventually, we designed the race car. Started the racing series in Italy. That's the series you see in the picture. And that's like on board from that series. That was a single maker series only for our cars. The car, by the way, we call it the model name is G1 and the series was the G1 series. It ran for two years. And during those two years we learned a lot about motorsport. We thought that we understood when we started this journey that okay, cars are very expensive. Let's design a cheaper car, you know. There are many, many other challenges in racing and we learn them mainly by operating a racing series. And we couldn't know that before we started  this racing series. You can imagine an Israeli manufacturer of racing cars runs a series in North Italy. it's not the most common thing you'll hear. By the way, how does this work? So you designed the cars, you manufacture the cars, and then you have to go and pitch those cars as a series to drivers to come and drive them to compete? Is that how it works? Yeah. Something like that. Yeah. You need to start building your connections and get to know more teams and more drivers and convince them that your series have a value for them because it has a lower barrier for entry and it's very fast the cars and you have a lot of exposure. So people will see you if you want to start your career and stuff like that. But starting that we were very focused on the series when we started back in 2018. But again, we wanted to, we we were a very, we were still but back then, we were a very small young tech company and we thought, okay, what else we can do to make our cars better, to differentiate them from other cars. And we wanted to give the drivers the ability to not need to hire experts to help him improve. Because motorsports, like it's very data centric sport. You need to rely on data to improve. It's not as simple as kicking a ball into the goal or something. Even in that area, we are starting to see more and more data coming in. Right. Motorsport on the cars, you have a lot of sensors already and you need to know how to use that data to improve. And drivers usually don't know that. You need to hire that expert to do that. And we said, okay, we can go around that expert and give the driver those tips on how to improve automatically. If we make all the cars connected we upload the data we analyze the data in real time and we give that to the drivers. And that's where we started developing our data platform. Again, it was for the driver. We had the dream. Like, imagine you're driving and you're seeing, like you hear what you need to improve or you see that on the dashboard of something. But the car teaches you. That's what we wanted to do. But then we started the series. We understood that this solution is not limited only for the driver because it's a series. You want to also differentiate yourself. You want to attract viewers that will bring sponsors, that will bring more drivers. [--] So, yeah, exactly. Down spiral. You did the exact motion that we are doing. And Marco, our EVP of Media Solutions, will be super proud when he see you. Because this is what he do, does all the time. Anyway, so, we understood that we have a solution here that no one has and no one else developed that yet. We looked for other solutions. We couldn't find anyone, anything. And then we thought, okay, that's what we need to do. We need to develop that platform for racing. And this is where we like we saw the light and we didn't look back since. And that's what you're seeing around. And like and my background, you see different user interfaces, like the data augmentation we do for the linear TV broadcast, the overview screen that if you're a driver you can go and see where you are compared to other drivers. The briefing screens for the drivers to see where they do what they did good or bad. And a second stream viewing interface for the end users or the viewers and many more. And that's what we're doing now. We are also implementing the connectivity to eSports, which is a crazy thing because this is also something unique for motorsport in racing. And unlike other sports, the game that you play is similar completely to driving a car, except for the acceleration. Because you sit at home with your steering wheel and the pedals, you can buy a kit. It's not expensive. But when you play NBA 2K or FIFA. You don't have a basketball and a hoop, right? No, no. You cannot see yourself going on the court with LeBron James and going to play against him. But if you are a super thin driver, actually, you can go on track. You need to be fit and race with the best and you'll see your fast. I can already imagine the virtual reality headsets that are already placing you in there with potentially vibrating chair that can mimic the acceleration. That's crazy. Yeah. So that's what we call mixed reality races. And this is something the platform is going to also because it's a data platform eventually. And we can collect data from cars, we collect the data from simulators. It's the same thing and we merge them together. Wow. That's just unbelievable. And so, tell me a little bit about the future of the racing sport, because cars are becoming more autonomous. I'm watching the different cars on the road like Tesla already advertising that they go to zero to 60 in three seconds. Is this going to affect in any way racing? Are we ever going to see autonomous cars racing each other, you know, potentially also against humans? So, you'll be surprised, but there are already autonomous cars racing each other. There was a thing called the Roborace and they are autonomous cars that are racing to each other. It's pretty cool. Motorsport traditionally was the, it acted as development platform for the automotive industry. So you see a lot of manufacturers developing technologies on track. And then those technologies are being conveyed to the road cars that you are using. And we see that very strongly today with the electric revolution, that those electric components are being taken to the limit on the track and getting their tracks that stand. And then you can use that. So motorsport will play, as I see it, a very significant role in the years to come as the, again, the place where all those new technologies will be perfected. And also, even when in whenever it comes and the roads will be filled with autonomous cars and you will not be allowed to drive, I think those islands where you can experience that human emotion, that is one of the most amazing. You know, if you can fly a jet fighter, maybe it can be more exciting, but taking a car on on track to the limit is something that it's crazy. It's amazing experience. And I don't see that disappear. I hope never. Now, I'm going to have to go and try that for myself because it sounds exhilarating. Being a little bit distance from the field, you never actually imagine yourself there. But now, I can see why the excitement. I can see the thrill and I can more than anything see the potential of what you're doing here. A data driven platform for motor racing, both for the driver, but also for the game, for the player at home, for the viewer on the TV and for the team that is debriefing after and also the manufacturer of the car that wants to see, okay, how did the driver interact with the car, what were the limitations, how did we hold up against others. I think that you're exactly on to what it should be and it's really really impressive. Thank you, Tamir, for taking the time to share this with me. Before we leave, I have to ask you for the hardest question. Three words that you would use to describe yourself. I just wanted before I answer, I have to say that you describe it perfectly. Because what we are saying that we are doing is creating a digital universe around racing grants. You described that universe of the users so beautiful. The three words. Determined, I think. Creative. Yeah. Optimistic. Energetic. I don't know. Yeah, I think the first two were much easier. That's why it's the hardest question. And I'll take all those four or five words. All those seem to me makes perfect sense. But I think that the first two are the strong, like what I say, I think can describe myself the best. 100%. The story of growing up in Israel with practically no industry, but yet you have the passion and motivation to go there, creating this grassroots program within Ben Gurion University in Beer Sheva, the team that is going to race with the car in Italy, going to land a job in Italy, coming back, starting a company based in Israel that creates a series in Italy. I mean, the whole stories of determination and perseverance and creativity above it all. So, thank you, Tamir, again for the inspiration. This was wonderful. Toda raba. And stay safe and healthy. Yeah. My pleasure and honor. Thank you.
