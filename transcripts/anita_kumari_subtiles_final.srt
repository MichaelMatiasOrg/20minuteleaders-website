1
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,360
Anita Kumari, thank you so much

2
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,600
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,480
How are you?

4
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,600
I'm doing wonderful.

5
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,920
Thank you for inviting me.

6
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,840
I'm honored to be here.

7
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,400
Well, I'm always excited

8
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,320
to talk about happiness,

9
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,000
and I have a feeling

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,800
that we're going to talk about happiness

11
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,320
over the next 20 minutes or so

12
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,720
because you've had a fabulous career

13
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,960
at so many wonderful companies

14
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,960
as a senior human resource, right?

15
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,480
You were at Kaiser and Google

16
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,840
and VeriFone,

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,600
and different other companies

18
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,880
that we won't go into detail here.

19
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,720
But then you've transitioned

20
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,440
into happiness and mental health,

21
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,120
and you've written a book

22
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,920
"Find Your Happy"

23
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,560
which you've just shown me a second ago.

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,440
Maybe you can show it again

25
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,040
in a second. Beautiful.

26
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,960
And one of the things you told me

27
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,080
that you're really passionate about

28
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,440
is the space of mental health

29
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,080
and limiting beliefs

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,120
and how to go beyond

31
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,200
those limiting beliefs.

32
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
So Anita, enough from me,

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,440
I want to hear about you a little bit

34
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,120
and about your journey.

35
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,480
Yeah. So, I used to be

36
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,280
in a high tech corporate career

37
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,400
throughout my life.

38
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,120
And then life threw me a few curveballs,

39
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,120
and I had to learn

40
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,560
how to throw aces and not give in.

41
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,520
And that was a point in my life

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,760
when I started going

43
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,480
into emotional development

44
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,840
and self growth

45
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,320
and started doing courses

46
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,080
like Landmark, Tony Robbins, Oprah,

47
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,760
Deepak Chopra.

48
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,160
... meditation

49
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,320
and yoga and all that stuff.

50
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,560
And because

51
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,880
when I was going through stuff,

52
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,720
I was in a very abusive relationship

53
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,240
at that point in my time.

54
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,640
And because of my cultural background,

55
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,360
I wasn't willing to leave

56
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,640
even though everyone around me

57
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,080
was telling me to leave.

58
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,160
Like every weekend,

59
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,760
like other people used to say,

60
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,160
"Oh Friday, everyone is happy

61
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,920
that they have a weekend.

62
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,040
Why are you so scared?"

63
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,320
But I was scared to be

64
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,800
alone at home with him, right,

65
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,640
because I didn't know

66
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,920
what was going to happen

67
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,960
because he had already tried

68
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,680
to kill me three times.

69
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,560
Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Okay.

70
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,840
I'm sorry, Anita, before we move on,

71
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,560
I'd love to hear a little bit more

72
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,720
because, obviously,

73
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,000
the second part of this journey

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,200
is going to be a wonderful one

75
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,560
about how you're empowering

76
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,360
other women now

77
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,400
and you're inspiring other women.

78
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,360
But as long as you feel comfortable,

79
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,880
I'd love to understand a little bit more

80
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,120
about what happened there

81
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,840
and how you broke free of that.

82
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,520
Sure. So, let me give you

83
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,960
a little bit of background

84
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,920
of how I even ended up with him.

85
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,520
So, because I'm from India

86
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,640
and I've grown up in a very sheltered

87
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,360
and nice family atmosphere. So, basically

88
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,360
if someone will say something,

89
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,760
I would trust them, right?

90
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,640
And I met this guy who was my friend,

91
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,840
and I was very young

92
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,840
and he told me he will kill himself

93
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,720
if I don't marry him.

94
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,200
And now I know that's crazy,

95
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,800
but that time I thought he loved me

96
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,500
that's why.

97
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,800
And I thought,

98
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,320
Anyway, I have to ...

99
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,040
why not marry him

100
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,760
because he loves me so much.

101
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,160
So, I got married pretty young

102
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,960
and came here.

103
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,840
And then I did my MBA.

104
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,640
Where is this in the world by the way?

105
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,400
Oh this, I met him in India,

106
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,280
but we came here

107
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,240
as soon as we decided to get married

108
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,760
because my parents wouldn't approve,

109
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,880
his parents wouldn't approve.

110
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,080
We were very young.

111
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,760
Wow.

112
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,480
Yeah. And I finished only

113
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,080
my undergrad at that time.

114
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,200
And I came here

115
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,720
and I think for one year

116
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,760
the fairytale lasted,

117
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,840
but after that, I ... job.

118
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,520
I started getting very successful.

119
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,080
And even from my first job,

120
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,080
I don't know why people

121
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,800
started putting me with the VPs and stuff

122
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,960
even though I was like scared

123
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,800
that I was like a very junior person.

124
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,120
But someone, they saw leadership qualities,

125
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,040
and so every time I would have a meeting,

126
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,280
he would try to sabotage it.

127
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,760
I started doing MBA

128
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,360
and got into Dean's scholar list.

129
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,320
And that was like every time

130
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,600
something like that would happen,

131
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,840
that ...

132
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,160
he would get more abusive.

133
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,280
And so, when you say abusive,

134
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,120
just to clarify,

135
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,880
that is obviously the emotional abuse ...

136
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,400
And the physical abuse ...

137
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,760
But every time I,

138
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,560
once or twice I had gotten mad

139
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,360
that I'll go and tell someone

140
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,560
and then he would start crying

141
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,760
and then I would feel sorry for him

142
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,920
so I wouldn't usually tell someone.

143
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,880
But what happened is

144
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,240
I'm a very happy person.

145
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,160
I started totally losing myself

146
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,920
in the sense I wouldn't even smile.

147
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,440
And people who knew us

148
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,600
like from our ...

149
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,640
they used to say,

150
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,640
"What did you do to her?

151
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,960
She doesn't even smile anymore.

152
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,640
She used to laugh so much."

153
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,040
But anyway, I didn't think any of it.

154
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,040
I just thought if I ... myself more

155
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,160
because he didn't like me doing anything

156
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,080
which got me any recognition.

157
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,400
So I stopped writing poetry,

158
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,040
I stopped being on stage,

159
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,360
I stopped pretty much

160
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,320
talking to people,

161
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,400
and I got so under-confident

162
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,680
that if someone would so much

163
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,280
as say hello to me

164
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,040
I would start crying, right.

165
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,720
And I wouldn't ...

166
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,920
I wouldn't even like

167
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,480
go to a grocery store alone,

168
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,060
and the people who know me then

169
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,800
they say that I always used to walk

170
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,680
with my head down.

171
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,360
But I didn't realize

172
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,160
because I was the one doing it, right?

173
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,640
And I used to think of it it's my fault,

174
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,720
like if I do this different,

175
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,440
that different, he might change.

176
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,960
But nothing changed.

177
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,320
And then, because I used to go

178
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,800
to my doctor for everything he did,

179
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,480
she referred me to a therapist

180
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,800
who told me I should leave

181
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,160
while I still can in one piece.

182
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,000
Wow. That's what she said?

183
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,960
She said you should leave

184
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,280
while you still can in one piece.

185
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,320
Yes. Because she said

186
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,720
with his demeanor, he can even break

187
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,600
your hands and legs

188
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,800
if you tell him you will leave

189
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,160
and then pretend to take care of you.

190
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,720
So, but I didn't understand that time.

191
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,800
So, that was my foray

192
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,640
into mental health

193
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,480
because, so I mean,

194
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,760
finally I had a miscarriage

195
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,480
because of him.

196
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,560
And I even was scared

197
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,680
if I go into, I was hiking

198
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,120
in the Santa Cruz Mountains,

199
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,400
and he took me to a very deserted place

200
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,520
where there was no one.

201
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,840
And on top of the hill,

202
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,880
he was like getting one of his moods

203
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,240
and I was thinking,

204
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,400
if he pushes me right now

205
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,240
no one will ever know

206
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,920
what happened to me, right?

207
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,900
And that was my,

208
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,480
I think, wake up call little bit.

209
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,680
And another was miscarriage.

210
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,080
And then I just decided to leave

211
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,320
and I just left with a few clothes

212
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:08,960
and few shoes.

213
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,840
But after I left,

214
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,600
and I took a restraining order,

215
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,320
but he was able

216
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,880
to emotionally manipulate me

217
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,480
to feel guilty of leaving him

218
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,400
and made me sign a power of attorney.

219
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,240
Pretty much he kept everything.

220
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,080
So anyway, so I started my life

221
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,280
from ground zero.

222
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,160
So, just for context,

223
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,040
your starting your life again

224
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,200
at ground zero. First of all,

225
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,840
I can't even believe what I'm hearing.

226
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,520
And so, I'm extremely inspired

227
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,480
by the next thing

228
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,080
that we're gonna talk about

229
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,720
because you took that adversity

230
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,200
and you're channeling that through

231
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,320
to empower other women

232
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,600
and other people around the world.

233
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
But before that, give me the context.

234
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,760
So, when you leave with a bag of clothes

235
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,960
and some shoes, how old are you?

236
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,400
Where are you in the US?

237
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,880
What are you doing during that time?

238
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,840
Yes, I was out of a job at that time

239
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,840
so I didn't want to leave,

240
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,640
but it was so bad

241
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,840
that I could not stay.

242
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,680
And so, I had a friend who said,

243
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,440
"Okay, you can."

244
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,680
My therapist also told me,

245
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,440
"Don't live alone

246
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,480
because he's going to come after you."

247
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,760
So, I had a friend, so I decided to,

248
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,840
they said that I can stay

249
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,480
in their house for a little bit.

250
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,520
So, I just picked up some clothes.

251
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,640
I decided to, I went with them

252
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,440
and started living there.

253
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,920
And didn't tell anyone where I was

254
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,120
because otherwise he would come

255
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,680
and he was trying to get me back.

256
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,640
But my therapist told me,

257
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,240
"Don't go back

258
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,560
because you won't be alive then

259
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
'cause now he knows

260
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,520
that you can leave" right.

261
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,880
Because any time I would say,

262
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,360
"I will leave."

263
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,840
when he was misbehaving or abusing,

264
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,440
then he would say,

265
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,400
"If you try to leave,

266
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,720
I'll kill you and kill myself."

267
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,960
So, I thought it was that way.

268
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,040
But the thing is,

269
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,820
I mean, if you have heard

270
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,240
of severe narcissistic, psychotic person,

271
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,600
I think he was one of that.

272
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,320
So he knew ... how he can manipulate me

273
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,840
because he knew me from my childhood.

274
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,160
I had no support system here.

275
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,640
And because I was only allowed

276
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,160
to be friends

277
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,240
with his friends' wives kind of thing.

278
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,280
So, but still, I had some colleagues

279
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,880
and some people who I think

280
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,000
God sent to help me.

281
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And then I joined a job

282
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,440
within, I think, a few weeks of moving out.

283
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,880
And so I started saving money

284
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,600
and meanwhile, I know in California,

285
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,760
it's community property.

286
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,240
I even like, my therapist

287
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,440
had referred me an attorney

288
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,960
and I thought I'll hire him,

289
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,040
but he found out and he convinced me

290
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,280
that attorneys take all the money

291
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,640
so I should not have any attorney.

292
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,640
So, I didn't have any attorney,

293
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,480
and he had two in the background.

294
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,640
And so basically,

295
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,960
he was able to threaten me

296
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,840
to ... make me feel guilty enough

297
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,640
for me to give him

298
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,520
the power of attorney.

299
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,760
I have to ask,

300
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,560
the parents back home in India,

301
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,000
your community back home in India,

302
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,400
are they a part of the picture

303
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,160
at this point?

304
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,760
Are they involved in any way?

305
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,040
No, they are not,

306
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,760
because my family is very simple.

307
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,600
Like if you tell them

308
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,680
he did this, they'll say,

309
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,360
"Oh, let us talk to him.

310
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,920
He will get better" right.

311
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,040
Because they don't know anyone

312
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,440
can be that bad, that psychotic.

313
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,400
And they are too far away.

314
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,600
I have to say, so I understand that mindset,

315
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,400
but I have to, because

316
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,280
in the last few months,

317
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,640
I've been hearing constantly about,

318
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,600
there are so many stories

319
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,640
that have come up of domestic abuse

320
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,400
and domestic violence, not just in the US,

321
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,720
but around the world,

322
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,040
that hearing it firsthand now

323
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,920
from your experience,

324
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,920
it just brings up all these emotions

325
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,920
of reading all these articles.

326
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,960
So, I can't even imagine

327
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,560
what it's like going through that.

328
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,720
You know, it was really bad.

329
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,800
Believe me, I didn't even know

330
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,080
I will survive that year

331
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,040
because I'd never lived alone

332
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,880
in my life,

333
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,240
I was in a foreign country

334
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,440
with no support system, no money,

335
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,720
and even after I moved out

336
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,760
of that friend's place,

337
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,520
as soon as I found a job, right.

338
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,640
So, I had no furniture.

339
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,840
I slept on the floor

340
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,240
'til I was able to buy my furniture.

341
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,280
And I had a friend who gave me one glass,

342
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,320
one ... one plate, some like,

343
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,080
because I cook a lot at home.

344
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,480
So some rice, some lentil, everything.

345
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,520
So, she was like an angel for me

346
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,120
even though I didn't know her that well.

347
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,800
But she realized it, right,

348
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,360
because she's an older woman.

349
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,080
And so I took me,

350
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,760
I think a month or something or more,

351
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,320
to get the furniture, buy something,

352
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,840
then gradually buy my utensils.

353
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,800
Now I have everything,

354
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,320
and I'm proud to say it's all my-made

355
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,880
and doesn't belong to anyone else.

356
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,440
100% my hard work.

357
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,320
And during this course

358
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,040
I kept on doing

359
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
all the self development

360
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,440
because it takes a long time to heal.

361
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
So, I wasn't willing to go

362
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,680
into any relationship.

363
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,120
I wasn't willing to date anyone.

364
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,560
I wasn't willing to trust any guy

365
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,840
because I wasn't healed.

366
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,600
Right

367
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,080
So, I'm glad that

368
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,840
I went through all this trainings

369
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,800
to really heal, and not just really heal,

370
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,200
my therapist then started

371
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,400
trying to put me on an antidepressant.

372
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,600
And I know the side effects.

373
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,160
So, I decided I'm not going to take it.

374
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,640
I'll start every day with meditation,

375
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,080
yoga, and some zumba class or kickboxing,

376
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,520
something which is very

377
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,120
untoward of the person I was ...

378
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,880
So, that gradually got me out

379
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,080
of my comfort zone.

380
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,000
And in order for me

381
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,520
to really be able to even trust

382
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,640
or be like next to a guy again,

383
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,920
because,

384
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,280
when you are really hurt,

385
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,880
you basically you think

386
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,080
everyone is the same, right?

387
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,480
Even though it's a small sample,

388
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,760
one person.

389
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,920
So, I started taking salsa lessons

390
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,960
where you have to dance with a guy, right,

391
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,880
a partner.

392
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,760
Yeah. I love salsa.

393
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,600
Yeah. Thank you. Me too.

394
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,520
And dancing is very good.

395
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,440
I think that was also,

396
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,600
so that gradually got me out of that,

397
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,160
I would say, out of that fear,

398
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,720
I mean, apart from my self development.

399
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,480
And then I realized

400
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,800
so many of my friends,

401
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,320
even if like real things like this

402
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,000
are happening,

403
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,440
sometimes they are not able

404
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,280
to get out of it

405
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,440
and sometimes they don't talk about it

406
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,440
or they feel ashamed

407
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,280
like I used to feel ashamed before.

408
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,400
Now I empower with this story.

409
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,480
And also I used to, I wouldn't even dare

410
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,760
to dress up or things like that

411
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,680
because always he would be

412
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,720
very, very crazy about it, right.

413
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,560
I'm sure.

414
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,240
Yeah. So, right now I feel that

415
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,600
all mental issues can be resolved

416
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,800
with natural mental exercises

417
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,320
or hypnotherapy and psychology

418
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,120
and without medication too.

419
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,680
I mean of course,

420
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,400
some people who are totally extreme,

421
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,640
then they need the medication

422
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,560
at that time,

423
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,480
but most of the things like anxiety,

424
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,680
stress, worry, panic attacks, OCD,

425
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,480
moodiness, and not feeling enough

426
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,440
not feeling love,

427
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,480
those things are self-esteem.

428
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,800
They all can be resolved.

429
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,880
And like I have resolved

430
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,760
and you see ... living example

431
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,720
from where, if you see my pictures there,

432
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,280
I look like 15 years older

433
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,240
than I look right now.

434
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,040
Wow. Yeah.

435
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,520
So, I'd love to talk

436
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,320
about that transition,

437
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,760
because now, you are doing

438
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,600
such wonderful things

439
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,280
with a new startup, HappinessFactor,

440
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,200
and I'll say it now and later,

441
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,120
but you have also

442
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,800
opened positions for interns

443
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,880
that I'd love to tell a lot of my friends

444
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,560
about it because it sounds

445
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,960
like a wonderful opportunity.

446
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,520
But you also wrote the book,

447
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,120
"Find Your Happy"

448
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,080
Talk to me about this journey

449
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,360
in writing this book

450
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,920
and what led to that.

451
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,440
Yeah. So, people knew me

452
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,960
as a high tech ... person

453
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,480
because that was my background.

454
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,880
So I ... and wanted them to think of me

455
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,720
as a happiness

456
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,760
and emotional wellness expert.

457
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,160
And then people told me

458
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,600
"Oh, it will take one year to write a book"

459
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,780
I didn't have one year

460
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,600
because I wanted to create the branding.

461
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,520
I said, "I'll write it in one month"

462
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,760
and everyone laughed at me.

463
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,960
But when I'm dedicated,

464
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm really dedicated.

465
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,640
For one month, I slept for four hours.

466
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,040
I found 10 or 20 people to interview,

467
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,640
because I only wanted to write

468
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,240
about real life stories.

469
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,560
So, I interviewed someone

470
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,960
who had killed someone with six bullets,

471
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,360
was incarcerated for life,

472
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,960
but how meditation changed his life

473
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,480
and now he's out, he has a wife and a kid.

474
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,690
Then I interviewed someone now

475
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,120
who had survived breast cancer

476
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,120
and she's also thriving.

477
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,520
She's a good friend of mine.

478
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,080
Then someone who had gone through

479
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,880
debilitating accidents,

480
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,520
or very bad divorces,

481
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,800
so much so like I have a friend

482
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,320
who lost everything in the divorce

483
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,520
and still is fighting custody for his kid.

484
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,800
And then people who have gone through abuse,

485
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,120
people who have gone through, of course,

486
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,040
the abuse has some part of my story too,

487
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,760
though he doesn't have my name.

488
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,560
And then someone who was raped

489
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,760
when he was eight years old

490
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,600
and he never told anyone,

491
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,360
and finally I covered his story.

492
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,080
And now they found out that the same guy

493
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,960
under the pretext

494
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,080
of helping those young kids

495
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,880
because they were from a very poor family,

496
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,240
very big family,

497
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
like 17, 18 brothers, sisters,

498
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,360
parents didn't have enough to feed

499
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,160
in Chicago.

500
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,040
And that guy used to tell the parents

501
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,640
that I will give this kid some work

502
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,920
to stack shoeboxes

503
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,080
because he had a shoe shop,

504
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,480
and he used to rape them behind.

505
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,080
... didn't know they were raped.

506
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,080
And so, this actually story

507
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,840
has given me the maximum kudos

508
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,680
because many people write to me

509
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,680
that reading that,

510
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,560
they don't feel ashamed

511
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,280
and they got closure.

512
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,920
Because people feel ashamed, right,

513
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,040
even if it's not their fault.

514
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,800
That's what I think the perpetrators

515
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,120
always take advantage of.

516
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,840
When you are too gullible

517
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,720
and too innocent,

518
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,480
and you believe everything they say,

519
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,520
especially if you don't have

520
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,080
a support system or if you don't know

521
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,080
what's going on.

522
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,880
So, all the 10 stories in my book

523
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,720
are real stories of real life people.

524
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,480
And at the end of each chapter

525
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,880
I have given how they have overcome

526
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,760
and are thriving in life,

527
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,800
so why can't you

528
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,480
who have so much going on.

529
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,200
Because many times when I quote people,

530
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,400
one on one they say,

531
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,720
"Oh, it's easy for you to say

532
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,640
because you never had anything bad."

533
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,320
They don't know my background, right?

534
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,160
So, they think right now

535
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,000
I look happy, so I must have everything

536
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,160
going so good for me all the time.

537
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,880
And so, then I wanted them to see that

538
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,200
no, not everyone has it going good

539
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,880
all the time;

540
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,560
the people who are really successful

541
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,240
are the ones who make the best

542
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,480
of what's happening and come out,

543
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,160
learn enough from that experience

544
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,240
and come out of ...

545
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,600
Unbelievable. Wow.

546
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,320
Okay, that's truly inspiring.

547
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,960
And again, a lot of people can talk about

548
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,600
mental wellness and happiness.

549
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,800
A lot of these people are coming

550
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,280
from solid backgrounds,

551
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,560
from okay upbringings,

552
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,560
but the adversity that you went through

553
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,560
and the emotional strifes

554
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,200
that you went through,

555
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,160
I think it's just inspiring

556
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,040
that you're channeling that

557
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,080
towards helping others.

558
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,520
And so, in the last few minutes

559
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,880
that we have, I'd love to learn

560
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,080
about the HappinessFactor

561
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,720
and what you are doing with that startup,

562
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,160
because you decided to leave

563
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,600
the traditional tech world

564
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,280
and the positions

565
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,320
that you've held before

566
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,480
with human resources

567
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,800
and now you've transitioned

568
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,560
into this startup.

569
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,800
So, talk to me about that.

570
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,040
Yeah. So, I started my startup,

571
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,720
HappinessFactors, three years ago.

572
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,120
At that time when I started,

573
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,680
even though I have some very good mentors,

574
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,520
like some of my ex VPs joined,

575
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,040
some of the very famous

576
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,280
Fortune 500 people are on my board,

577
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,880
as well as quite a few doctors

578
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,040
and LP practitioners and hypnotherapists.

579
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,080
And so, initially when I started,

580
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,840
I had a few mentors and they told me

581
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,200
"Who will pay for happiness?"

582
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,320
People think happiness ... come free.

583
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,920
And now everyone tells me,

584
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,300
"You are in the right place, right time."

585
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,080
...

586
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,620
So, I think I saw it

587
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,280
much before others did, right?

588
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,720
So that time I started,

589
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,560
and then I wanted to develop an app

590
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,720
that time when I started.

591
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,920
But still, I did my research on Headspace,

592
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,920
on Calm, and all others available.

593
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,040
And I found what's not working

594
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,240
because many of my friends,

595
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,000
the companies buy those apps for them

596
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,920
but they don't use it

597
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,960
because they don't find it

598
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,440
interesting enough.

599
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,800
So, I decided to do

600
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,040
a different way.

601
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,480
So, I made it more gamified

602
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,440
and more interesting

603
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,200
and more targeted

604
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,560
towards the millennials.

605
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,880
And I made sure that all the background

606
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,480
is very happy and people can relate to it.

607
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,560
And so, right now

608
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,800
it's still getting developed,

609
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,240
and the app is just a very small part.

610
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,960
So, I'm doing the whole ecosystem.

611
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,720
So, we have coaches on site

612
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,680
where we coach people on anxiety,

613
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,800
on whatever problem

614
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,560
they come up with

615
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,200
because first session is always free.

616
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,600
That's called a strategy session

617
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,600
where we decide

618
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,520
if it's a good fit for us or them or not.

619
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,960
If not, I'll refer them to someone else.

620
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,800
If it's a good fit,

621
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,560
then we will take it

622
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,960
on HappinessFactors

623
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,560
and either it will be me or someone else

624
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,200
who will be coaching them.

625
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,880
We also do lots of keynotes

626
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,800
at different companies.

627
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,720
Actually, I did one on mental health

628
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,800
at ServiceNow just two days ago

629
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,760
which went pretty well.

630
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,080
And I'm sure I'll be called back

631
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,280
to do another bigger session

632
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,160
because many people

633
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,880
were talking about that.

634
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,160
Then I do lots of workshops and trainings.

635
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,000
Right now, everything is of course,

636
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,720
on Zoom,

637
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,320
but I love to do in person,

638
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,040
and I have done like ... from one day

639
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,240
to halfday, to two days

640
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,680
at different companies

641
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,560
and mostly high tech

642
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,120
because that's my background.

643
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,280
But mental health

644
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,040
is universally applicable.

645
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,120
It doesn't have to be limited

646
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,440
to high tech.

647
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,120
And I also did some talks for some high schools

648
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,280
and some colleges here too.

649
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,600
And I got called to do one

650
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,520
at the Cupertino High,

651
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,240
but it got postponed

652
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,520
because of covid again.

653
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,680
And they were saying

654
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,800
that mental health is so important

655
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,680
for these teenagers

656
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,560
who are working so hard

657
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,960
to get into a good schoo,

658
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,760
and the stress sometimes gets to them,

659
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,520
right.

660
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,920
So, how to manage that and not get angry.

661
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,800
So, we are creating

662
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,760
a whole emotional wellness ecosystem,

663
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,320
a one stop shop for everything

664
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,520
emotional wellness,

665
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,560
and we are doing it

666
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,520
without the use of drugs,

667
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,920
alcohol, or marijuana.

668
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,160
So that's my tagline,

669
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,560
that we not just help you

670
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,280
get happiness,

671
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,960
but sustain it without drugs,

672
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,560
alcohol, or marijuana.

673
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,840
And we are combining

674
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,120
the eastern methodologies

675
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,280
of Ayurveda, Yoga, Vedic teachings,

676
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,520
Sanatana Dharma,

677
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,000
and with Western psychology,

678
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,960
hypnotherapy,

679
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,880
neuro-linguistic programming, MER,

680
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,920
energy healing,

681
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,160
and creating unique solutions

682
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,160
that's not just take care of the symptoms

683
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,320
of mental health issues,

684
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,200
but they get rid of the root cause

685
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,400
so that people can live

686
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,960
a happy and fulfilled life

687
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,280
for as long as they want.

688
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,040
Anita, thank you for this.

689
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,080
Thank you for the wonderful work

690
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,640
that you're doing

691
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,880
and for helping others around the world.

692
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,760
Before we leave, I want to thank you

693
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,600
for being so generous

694
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
with your time as well.

695
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,400
And I'd love to hear three words

696
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,640
that you would use to describe yourself.

697
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,520
I would say unstoppable,

698
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,920
resilient, confident.

699
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
[crosstalk]

700
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,440
... tiny beam of light.

701
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,560
I love that. I love that.

702
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,840
Thank you very, very much.

703
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,280
Thank you.

704
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,240
Stay safe and stay healthy,

705
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:11,800
and I look forward

706
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
to maintaining in touch.

707
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,640
Thank you for everything.

708
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,480
Thank you so much.

709
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,000
Have a great evening.

710
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,720
You too.
