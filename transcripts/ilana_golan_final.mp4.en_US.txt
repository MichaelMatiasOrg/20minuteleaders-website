1 I wish I had that because it's so lonely at the top and it's so lonely when you're a high achiever and it's so hard for you to admit that you need help. And just having someone to talk to that has been there and walk the walk, not just talk the talk is a big difference. Ilana Golan, welcome to 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? Thank you. It's amazing to be here. I've been watching your shows every time and I just love it so. That warms my heart. Thank you very, very much. It's an honor and a pleasure to have you here as a guest. An entrepreneur at heart. An entrepreneur with the ventures, with an acquired venture behind you already. But with a lot of different, really interesting transitions along your career. And I'm particularly excited to talk about your journey, the insights you've gained from the twists and turns, the ups and downs leading up to Golan Ventures and to CareerLeap, which obviously is probably one of the most important conversations to be held in the midst of a pandemic. So, Ilana, take it away. Who are you and how do you even get started into this world? So, engineer, tech, you know, I've been in tech for a while and kind of moved up the chain from big companies like Intel to smaller companies and startups. Product, sales, kind of moved up the chain all the way to vice president. All across the board. All across the board. Leap to entrepreneurship with some ups and downs. Eventually, you know, my company was acquired. I moved to the venture side, and now I'm a public speaker and Forbes contributor. And I decided to just take all this knowledge and help others do the same. Because I realized that leaping in career is something that I somehow know how to do and I want to help others. So. I love it. You ended up getting to the realization that you really love helping people, understand what they can do and deal with that difficult moment. I have to say that many entrepreneurs that I know, most entrepreneurs that I know, they are tech executives, they've had businesses before, they don't turn to helping others as a full time job. So, what really motivated you to go and decide, now I'm going to spend most of my time helping other people realize what they need to do? It's amazing question. You know, and I honestly contemplated with this for a long time, like it's something I wanted to do. And I was somewhat scared to do it. And it was like somewhat, I used to be kind of this business woman and I going to be what, like a coach or I wasn't even sure I like coaching, and I don't even see myself as a coach. I see myself more as a growth strategist. So, I wasn't really sure if this is the right thing, but I found myself just helping a lot of people on the phone. And honestly, you can't help a person to leap in their career over coffee. Like it just doesn't work. First of all, you can't scale and be, it's not a one time thing. Like it's a journey and you have to be there with them on the journey. And, you know, and I was looking for a good way to do that. And eventually I just found that I love doing this. I love to see people transform. I love to see people change. And I wish I had that because it's so lonely at the top. And it's so lonely when you're a high achiever and it's so hard for you to admit that you need help. And just having someone to talk to that has been there and walk the walk, not just talk the talk is a big difference. Walk me through that relationship. That conversation that I might have with you as I need to make that leap. Now and before that dumb it down for me a little bit, what does it mean for a person to want to make that leap? Does it mean that they are looking for different jobs, they're not fulfilled, they think they can get higher to where they are today? What does that entail? Yeah. Basically, bingo. Like it's everything you just said, right? I mean, it's usually the high achievers, right? It's the people who are looking forward and saying, you know what, there must be more to life than what this is. And I could be doing more. And I want to live more of a legacy and I want to make more of an impact. And I want to do something that matters. And, you know, I'm probably at the last quarter of my career and I need to make it count. At least two three quarters, Ilana. At least two, three quarters. So, yes. So, I want to make it count. And you know, and I remembered it for myself because I used to wake up in the middle of the night and like, it can't be that this is it. Like it can't be. I'm overachiever and yes, I'm doing amazing things. But what's next? Like what's the next big thing? And, you know, just So, what I'm hearing from you is something that I'm starting to pick up from all the different episodes. And that is some of that innate curiosity and passion that is burning inside you. And you're saying, yes. I'm doing all these things, I'm vice president of this and I'm executive of this, and I founded this company. But you're looking to really understand how do I make that tangible impact on somebody and know that impact. So, my question then Ilana is, what is that impact? What is the impact of helping people make that leap in their careers? How does that even translate to tangible impact? Right. So, I mean, first of all, just seeing someone that they're basically almost turned off when you meet them, initially. You know, they're unfulfilled, they're unmotivated. They honestly take it usually home. They're not as happy as a person. They don't exercise as much or not as healthy as they want to be. Like everything is kind of like a downhill spiral. And I was in that downhill spiral. Right? You were? So, I feel it. Yeah. Why were you in the downward spiral? Story time. Oh my God. So, yeah. So, I mean in a quick few seconds. We have time Ilana, we have hours. I know. You're like counting. So, I was already vice president. I started the US operation technical operation of an Israeli startup here. It grew to 15 million. It was an amazing success. And then I wanted kind of that what's next. Right? So, I wanted to leap to entrepreneurship. Somebody I knew from the Technion wanted to do this together, build it kind of in the off hours, raise money, $800,000. And right when I basically did a big party for my previous job and to tell them about the startup, the same day he kicked me out. So, he took the money, kicked me out of business, and at some point within seconds or a day, I was left with nothing like no job, no salary, no startup, no investment. And I felt like the earth just like fell from under me. Right? So, it's that point. It's like, sorry for the language, the holy shit moment. It's like you wake up and, what do you do? Like what do I do? Do I look for a job? Do I look for a co-founder? Or do I start a business? Like what do you do. And you know, you don't have to have these big moments to really feel like, oh my God, I need more than this. And I've had those small moments in my life as well. Like you as an engineer, you're many times stuck as a technical person. And then you know, you move to like product and then you're stuck as a product. So, you keep on getting stuck because you're good at it. Right? The question is, how do you get unstuck? And it's a lot about reputation and network these days. So, that's really what plays a role. And the way people are finding opportunities is different than it used to be. So, people will reinvent themselves every year or two. And it's add to your skill. You need to learn. Right. So, we're talking about a new reality. You know, it's not just that we're living in covid times, but I believe the trend, especially in the tech sector, is that every two years people change positions for good and for bad, which means that a lot more people have the potential to reach that unstuck moment. Because if all of my friends are advancing every two years and it's my turn to advance like, holy shit, I need to be advancing just like my friends. How do you get unstuck? Walk me through some of the, you know, some of the big pointers for anybody that may be stuck that is present here with us. Right. And I'll say a few things. So, first of all, again, we will reinvent ourselves every year or two. And it's a skill, but nobody teaches you the skill. And what's more interesting is that the roles that you're looking at, especially in the tech sectors, nobody really taught you marketing or that kind of skills, or that kind of management. Like, you don't learn that in school. It's really experiences. And then you get into that chicken and egg. Like, but you don't have the experience. So, how can you do that. Right? So, the interesting part there is, how do you fast track to get those experiences so that you can claim it and you can have the confidence and you can build that reputation so that your network will open these opportunities your way. And that's how you leap. So, the unstuck is basically to figure out, first of all, what you want to do and which is crucial. Sometimes I look at it as experiments, just like startups experiment to figure out their market, you know, like, where they want to go next. Your go-to-market strategy, that's the same thing. You experiment with your career. You figure out one thing, you try it out. You see if it works. You start building your reputation network accordingly. If you don't like it, change it. The beautiful thing is, I say it to the leapers, In 2007, we all became a media company, and whether you like it or not, if nobody hears from you the assumption is that you have nothing to say. Right? So, you know but we can leverage this. We can basically leverage to tell a new story about ourselves and its power. Wow. How much of that is more is emotional versus, you know, mental and intellectual and tangible, and on just saying, okay. here's the pros, here's the cons, and here is what Ilana tells me that I need to do so I should just go do it? So, what is the mindset of a person who is a leaper in your mind? It's a great question because I think it's exactly all everything that you just said. Right? It's not enough to just give information these days. I mean, you have information on YouTube, right, you don't need to-- Right. So, it's not about information. It's really about the transformation and it's about, how do you get to that transformation. How do you get that kind of ability. How do you get inspired by people. How do you learn about opportunities you didn't even know about. Right? Because when you're in corporate and all you see is that senior director role that you want, you didn't even know that you could mentor in startup accelerators and join boards and be adviser like you didn't even know that these things exist. Right? So, it's really about opening your mind to what's possible, but also giving you the courage and the inspiration to move on and that kind of ability to keep pushing. Because when you're scared, you're going to tend to lean back to your comfort zone. So, it's really about everything. It's a lot of mindset, really. It's fascinating. At the end, it's all about fulfillment. And it's all about the pyramid of Maslow. Right? That you want to reach that hierarchy. And I guess one of the most difficult parts of it is knowing, acknowledging that you're stuck. Right? I'm assuming that it's very easy to get into a routine and sort of bending out because it's first of all, it's comfortable to have a position, even if you're a little bit stuck in it, you're stuck often in comfort, especially in our industry. So, there's a big part from when you are stuck to when you go to Ilana Golan and she helps you get unstuck. I agree. And honestly, I do. The big thing that I tell people is that life is in phases. And in different phases different things will be important for us. And sometimes it's really about finance and comfort and balance. And that's okay. You know, as long as you're admitting that this is what's important for you right now and this part is okay, then it's okay. Right? So, when I was in a big corporate and I knew that I'm going to have two children and I'm going to take two maternity leave and I wanted to run an Ironman and all sorts of things, then, you know, it was okay for me to be stuck because I wasn't stuck. I was doing the things that I love to do. Right? So, you know, to some extent you need to decide what's your must haves. And once you define your must haves, you need to say, okay, so now this is what's important for me and maybe its reputation and maybe its recognition, maybe its growth and maybe its more pay, whatever it is, right? Now, go chase it. So, the question that I have to ask is, executive in tech, two kids and an Ironman, how does that work? Well, first of all, I have to admit the Ironman was before the two kids. But yes. No. I am, I need to be busy. I see that. I can see that very clearly. But that's life, you know, like, I just want to make things happen. You know, I decide on a goal and I go pursue it. But I like to take people with me, you know, and that's the beautiful part. So, now that I'm surrounded with phenomenal leapers that are like, you know, I see them growing, I see them fulfilled, I'm seeing their eyes like spark, like it's just, something that I don't think I've ever felt before. And it's, you know, it's first of all, it's fulfillment. It's you feel like you're impactful. And beyond that, it's you know, it's the financial freedom and the geography freedom that I wanted for myself so that I can keep on traveling the world and still inspiring and making a lot of money. So, it's great. I love it. Circling back because that is a question that I'm fascinated by. I'm assuming that most people in the world that I mean, I'm assuming that the people that are already talking to you that are stuck, they are the top percentile that have acknowledged it and are making that leap. But there is a whole level of people that are stuck and they're just maybe they're not they don't know it or they don't know what to do about it. How can you tell if a person is exhibiting the symptoms of stuckness? Or the person who has the potential to make that leap but just doesn't realize it yet? It's a great question. I mean, first of all, I have to say that I accept roughly 1 out of 5 people that I talk to. Really? Yeah. I am very, very picky. And the reason is I want the people to have enough of the goal needs to be realistic, but high. Right? And they need to be committed. They need to be driven. They need to be coachable, resourceful, etc. Right? So, there is a certain type of people that I like working with. It's definitely more the high achievers in that top percentile. You know, people sometimes, again, they will feel stuck for a while. But sometimes, like I said, it's comfortable. And we said that. Right? But sometimes it literally wakes you up in the middle of the night or wakes you up. You see that you're anxious or you're not yourself and you're not the best version of yourself. And at that point, it's you know, it took me many years to ask for help. Now I have my own coaching and I pay crazy amounts for it. But it takes me higher. Right? And, you know, I think it took me years to understand that it's okay, even though I'm just like Air Force Girl. Right? That I probably shouldn't ask for help and I should just figure it out and you know, like figure, kind of prove that I can. But actually, when I ask for help, it's going to take me much faster and much better. Right? So, it took me many years to figure it out. And now I you know, I want to find the people that will, you know, if I give them a hand, they will take it and they will work hard and they will be committed and they'll get tremendous results. It sounds like it takes a lot of courage to do both of these sides to play on both roles, right? Yeah. It's courage all along. Right? Because every time you leap, you're going to be out of your comfort zone. So, the question is what kind of comfort zone and how big of a leap are you going to go for? And leap is scary. I mean, you're going to do by definition, it's something you haven't done before. By definition, it's something bigger. And you need to decide that this is what you want for yourself and for your family and for your fulfillment. So, yeah, it's not so. One of the things that I'm still thinking from a few sentences ago is you said of the term coachable. I never thought of the coaching as it's a two sided market. It's not just that somebody is willing to pay. And so, therefore, it's going to be a good fit. But you need somebody that's coachable, somebody that you will enjoy working with, because just as you're coaching them, I'm sure that a part of it is you're talking about how you're getting the fulfillment from them and you're getting motivated by seeing them progress. And so, you need people that will feed you that motivation as well, right? Absolutely. If I'm not 200% confident that I can take them higher, I don't want to work with them, not because I'm a jackass, just because I want to see those results. What I really care about is their transformation, I mean, I've had enough, like, whether one person joins or not that's not going to move the needle for me. But it will be good than to see people that don't get the results. So, yeah, I love this. Just wonderful. Ilana, thank you so much for being so generous with your time. It was lovely to have you here. Before we leave, I need to ask you for three words that you would use to describe yourself. I think I even said it. Making things happen. Making things happen. Yeah, I'm the type, it doesn't matter if it's a trip or an adventure or entrepreneurship or whatever. I'm going to make something happen and I'm going to take people along with me. So, yeah. Amazing. Ilana, thank you very much. Toda Raba. Best of luck and thank you for helping a lot of people along the way. It's really great. Take care.
