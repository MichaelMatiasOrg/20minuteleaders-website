1 And very often data can tease that out, we can learn how important price is to the customer, how important delivery time is to the customer. How many, you know, I think a big part of any marketplace is understanding that balance of supply and demand and how to not just like, forecast it, but also act against it. Peter Fishman, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you today? Doing well. Calling from California? I'm in San Francisco. San Francisco. Lots to cover, let's get into it. A fascinating, fascinating journey. I don't know how many more people I've had in this show that have so many different experiences as you've had. I even have to open it up next to me in order to read it which I have. I don't think I've ever had to do that before. All the way starting from studying economics at a London School of Economics to doing your bachelor also at Duke. University of California, Berkeley, doing your PhD. And then you're moving to NERA Economic Consulting, Google, Philadelphia Eagles, the Parthenon Group, Playdom, economist in Walt Disney, director of analytics at Yammer, principal data science manager at Microsoft, VP of analytics and growth at Zenefits, an amazing company. Head of analytics at Opendoor, chief bacon officer at Bacon Hot Sauce. You also have to explain to me what that is. And most recently, your are chief strategy officer of Eaze, a company that a lot of our friends in California will know what it's about and you'll explain to us soon. And now, the co-founder of your own company, Mozart Data. Did I get any of that right? Or am I completely off? It's a nice walk down memory lane. But, yeah. I spend a lot of different companies and a lot of different careers with some common themes there. I need about 19 minutes of breather after reading that list. Peter, what the hell. How does a person go through a list like this? How does that happen? Yeah. Well, so, I think you hit on one thing. I'm an economist by trade. So, I did my PhD in economics in the bay about eight miles east of where I'm currently living at UC Berkeley. It was a really special time to be in behavioral economics and applied behavioral economics. And I was working with a lot of data and sort of getting that training and sort of teasing causality out of a data set and trying to understand what's driving certain things that are happening simultaneously, is a really interesting tool set that I learned in graduate school. And then there was sort of this really nice movement towards using more and more and more data as it became more ubiquitous in tooling and decision making and then more and more cost effective so that organizations beyond just the giant tech companies could really use data to advance their decision making. And that's kind of been a common thread of my career. Right. I mean, you can literally see the thread as you're transitioning from being an economist and an analyst at these companies to then running the analytics and growth, but then transitioning into strategy in data science. And then most recently, the company that you're running now, Mozart Data, which we'll talk about it soon, is really helping companies analyze the data, pretty much the work that you've been doing across about a dozen of these fantastic organizations. But, Peter, before we get to Mozart Data, I'll leave that for the second half. I'd love to pick your brain on these nuggets and experiences from these different companies. As an economist, what is the role of an economist within these tech organizations? And when I look at also Walt Disney I think of it as a technology company like any other. So, a lot of larger companies have economists that opine on the direction of the economy because so much of the investment of people and resources depends on like basically the bigger macroeconomic picture. That's actually not at all what I do. An economist in my mind is about using an economic toolset to understand data. So, thinking about kind of some of that training and some of that sort of micro economic decision making and how that impacts the sort of macrovision of a company. So, I think a lot of what I do, though, my title is often economist and then my training as of to economist, I'm just an applied statistician that happens to have taken some economics classes. So, I think with that, Yeah. So, I think there's, the common theme there is that economists have a really good way, in my mind, of thinking about causality and prediction. Of modeling data. Right? Yeah. Of thinking about kind of the relationship between two things that are happening. And that's because data used to be a lot smaller. So, when I did my PhD, I had a giant giant, giant, giant, giant data set, which was about half a million observations. Today, if we saw a data set of half a million observations, it would be, you know, it would be of events that people might have picked up in minutes or even less. So, what used to sort of count as a giant data set is now a very, very trivial data set. And but because data was small, you had to think of really clever ways of understanding the world and understanding relationships in the data. And sometimes that meant things like describing a mechanism of behavior that would sort of account for these two things, covariance with each other. And sometimes that would be actually sort of these fake experiments that would be existing in the data. They weren't real experiments. They weren't like scientific method experiments where you try condition A, and condition B and see which one's the winner, which is so prevalent in today's A/B testing and other forms of testing. But rather, things that were sort of almost a natural experiment that would occur in the data, and you would have small data and you'd want to tease out that causal relationship and think about in a deep way about in what ways is this not a real experiment. So, that training, I think, really helped as we transitioned at smaller tech companies from essentially small data to almost everybody having big data due to a lot of cost efficiencies that have come up on the data side. That transition from an economist or an analyst to running analytics to being head of analytics, head of growth, both at Zenefits and then at Opendoor, how is that transition? What is the thinking process? Because to me, it sounds like it's a little bit even more dramatic than being an engineer to a head of engineering. Here, you're really, because you keep saying, economists is the thinking of causality and what impacts in modeling data to see trends. And in one hand, you're modeling you know, a subset of the data as in your position, it sounds to me like being head of analytics is now thinking much more broadly about, okay, where are we headed, what can we extrapolate from the data, and what can we request from the engineering to provide us for the future? Yeah. So, my first year at graduate school, I read Moneyball, which was for many folks in the analytics industry, that was a very sort of defining book. It's Michael Lewis's book on the Oakland A's and I was going to graduate school, just one town north of Oakland. And then ultimately, I became sort of the Moneyballer at the Philadelphia Eagles. Which is I use my graduate training to pull out sort of insights about players and football activity at the Eagles. And what I learned there was really about impact across an organization, which is very often there can be an insight. Like it's good to go for two when you're down by 14. Or, it's good to trade out of the first round. Or something that the data clearly, or it's good to go for it on fourth and short, whatever it is, the data might back that out and might be convincing in an academic way, but there's real people. And you don't get to really run all the experiments you want in the real world. And sort of having a big impact across an organization is not just about teasing out the insights and the data, but it's also about kind of driving impact within the organization. You're making it happen, right? Exactly. So, you had mentioned a few transitions, right? I transitioned from being an individual contributor at a company like Playdom and Disney, to being sort of a junior leader to being a more senior leader. And all of those have different steps, different sort of stakeholders across the organization. And you do kind of like you said, for many engineers, they transition from being a great engineer to now having a role of managing engineers. And there's just such a different sort of almost skill set. And the same is true, of course, in data and analytics, which is to say there's a certain skill set which involves being able to wrangle a bunch of data, being able to clean or tease insights out of data or communicate with data. I think actually, I would actually probably have the opposite because when you're an analytics leader, you're trying to tease those same insights out of the data and simplify it at the sort of cross-functional level. So, a lot of those core skills you develop as an IC, though the jobs aren't identical, a lot of those sort of core skills translate really nicely, into the managerial world. What do you enjoy more? Which of these? Well, obviously, I've spent the last sort of decade of my career leading data teams of different sizes. I joined Zenefits where I led the data team of just me and then ultimately grew it to a very large team as that company had a really meteoric scale up. And then obviously, most recently, before Mozart Data, I worked at a company Eaze. Eaze is basically a cannabis marketplace that matches supply and demand. It matches sort of dispensaries with consumers that want those products. Like any regular marketplace. Except for [--], because you just give the definition of what a marketplace does and it seems so common that we have a marketplace for everything from beverages, for food, for toys or whatever. Obviously, when it comes to cannabis and it's still a fresh thing, in many states, it's still something that requires explanation. But I'm sure it was a phenomenal experience. And I've actually been following the activity of Eaze. And I love the way that they're democratizing and regulating the whole transaction in the marketplace. But please continue. Yeah. So, I mean, I think actually data plays a big, big role there. I think when you think about a very highly regulated market, some of the challenges become actually addressing that regulation, but doing so really quickly and understanding what really matters to your customer. Right. And very often data can tease that out. We can learn how important prices to the customer, how important delivery time is to the customer, how many, you know, I think a big part of any marketplace is understanding that balance of supply and demand and how to not just like, forecast it, but also act against it. So, data plays a huge role in what it does. And it was a really forward thinking investment to build out a strong data capability because that was, you know, in some sense it's forward thinking, on the other hand, it's just us catching up to other industries. You know, you mentioned sort of food delivery, right? Looking like many of these are solved problems. Transportation, obviously, the matching of supply and demand that Uber and Lyft do. These are all very solve problems in those industries and kind of what a key role data plays at those places, just being able to map that to a place with a ton of regulatory challenges, this is cannabis, I think is has been and will continue to be a really interesting data and managerial problem for a while. It's pretty inspiring to me that a company like Eaze goes in and takes an economist and somebody that runs that heads analytics data science teams and puts in the position of a chief strategy officer. Because it really it is saying something. It's saying that we believe that our core strategy should be guided by data and by, you know, the causality and by a team that knows how to manage this data and run the analytics. I don't think that most companies have necessarily that persona as the chief strategy officer. I might be wrong, but I haven't seen that often. So, I agree with you. But I think the trend is that. So, when you think about sort of marketing, you've traditionally seen a lot of CMOs. But you start to see growth leaders. Now, growth tends to be just quantitative marketing, right? Now, similarly, on the operations side, when you think about solving a problem, like, how much demand do we expect to have in say, San Francisco on a Tuesday afternoon at 3PM, ultimately, this is a data problem, but it's also a people problem. You have to have the right number of people sort of there to essentially connect the supply and demand. So, on the one hand, to me, that kind of strategy work is ultimately just data problems. But you can see operations, you know, business operations and operations just looking more and more like data problems and having more and more savvy data leaders come into leadership roles in those functions, as well as the expectation for anybody that's a COO, that's a VP of operations, is that they're comfortable working, certainly in a BI tool, but also having a good grasp of data and what's happening with their data. And I think that's a perfectly way into what Mozart Data does. So, having that grasp, having that handle on all those different data and what you can do, talk to me a little bit about what Mozart Data does. And I'm particularly interested to hear really tangibly, what insights you've gained from, you know, these years of both being the data handler and the data manager, transitioning into your new baby, Mozart Data. Yeah. Thanks. And it's actually, like you said, a very relevant segue. Because what Dan, my co-founder and I saw was that there was this growing population of folks that were really competent and comfortable and itching to use the data. Like this population of business analysts, sales ops, marketing ops, business ops, heads of analytics, data analysts that really knew what they wanted from their data, had a great understanding of the business definitions and understanding of what data would inform those business decisions. But getting at that data, which is now getting more and more siloed by all the different sort of bevy of tools that people are using, people are using all these different SaaS tools and databases that all basically siloed that data that it's producing. So, there's this sort of imbalance where the demand for data is growing really rapidly and the supply, we know where it is, but it's hard to get at. You typically have to hire engineers or data engineers to essentially enable that centralization of data. And this was becoming a problem. And more and more companies, they hire folks like me or like Dan to actually go centralize that data so that it can be used across the organization. And a lot of that centralizing work is in my mind, sort of road or commodities. And we would just go from company to company, all the ones that you mentioned in my career, building out either the same stack or something very, very similar, sort of centralizing everything in a powerful data warehouse, a column or data warehouse. And we decided to essentially build that as a service so that really anybody that's really comfortable with data and data thinking and sequel could really do the data cleaning and the extracting, loading and transforming of the data that needs to be done with their skill set, with their understanding of the business definitions, with their understanding of their technologies, and not needing Python, Jinja, DAGs, custom languages to really make all of the work that is actually quite straightforward what data you need making that available without kind of a big data engineering. So, what we try to do is be the easiest way to onboard sort of a modern data stack. That's so interesting. So, would an interesting workflow be that led to that there's somebody in marketing that has a ton of data and CSVs that they get from somewhere within their company. They load that data to you. You help automatically cleaning it and starting to see some causality and some models out of them and provide them a framework for analyzing the data without having to use things like code or data science. Well, so, I want to back it up one step. So, you've already gotten to a point where the marketer has that data in CSV form. I want the marketer to be using the tools that they're comfortable in. Maybe that's HubSpot or maybe they're using Salesforce or maybe they're using Google ads or Facebook ads, and we want to be able for them with just the credentials, just the rights to be able to use that data, to be able to extract and load that into a central data warehouse. Now, they might also have CSVs or G-Sheet or something like that, which they also want to put in their data warehouse. They want to combine and clean this all and transform it all in their data warehouse. And they can do that with a platform like Mozart. Now, going all the way to the end, we are actually not in the BI space. So, we don't give you the tooling to go graphically represent your data and tell a story with your data. Which is, like I mentioned, from my time with the Eagles and then throughout my career, a really important part of what a great data person does, they tell a story with the answer. And that's not really what we provide, that we actually really like giving customers a good push in the back in terms of these are core tables, these are core piece of analysis that like we see a lot of folks in the space that you're in doing. So, we like to give people frameworks for doing the cleaning, for building their analysis. But really, what we want to do is empower you to get to that point of a central warehouse where you can start joining data from different tools, and we want to really make that available to anyone. I love that. Peter, before we go, I have to thank you for being generous with your time and for joining me in this show. I have two last questions that I have to ask. First of all, chief bacon officer of Bacon Hot Sauce. Now, you've been there for 10 years. So, I'm guessing this is going to, it's a little different from the rest. Yeah. So, Bacon Hot Sauce was a real passion project. So, actually, Dan, the co-founder of Mozart and I, started this Hot Sauce company 10 years ago. We had the idea that the two best things in the world were bacon and hot sauce, and we had to combine them and then we made that a reality. And then ran that business for 10 years. And actually, we ended up selling the business and starting Mozart. So, there's like sort of like a lie, which is to say, like there's a story about Slack, which is they were a tiny speck, and then suddenly, you know, that wasn't going where they wanted it to go. So, they decided to pivot into their chat app. We sort of tell the story it's only partially true, which is we had a hot sauce company that was failing and that we needed to pivot. So, we pivoted into this Mozart Data company, which is true in so far as that it's Dan and I are working on it together, but we're sort of data people at our core, but also bacon and hot sauce people also at our core. And Peter, I have to say that I feel like I've wasted 20 minutes. Because I want to go back and just talk about this bacon hot sauce company. But we'll leave that for another episode in another cycle. Before we leave, Peter, I need three words that you would use to describe yourself. Sure. So, number one is like, efficient. So, I love when people are able to make great 80-20 like trade offs. There's so much of the insight I think, comes in kind of just the setup and understanding of it. I guess another one that I sort of, you know, as a single word, it's sort of like a pay-it-forward. But I think one of those, There is hyphens in there. Yeah. Sure. So, pay it forward is what I found in the valley is that so much of my growth can be attributed to folks that I've worked with, both that were above me, that worked for me, and that were actually, I guess, horizontal to me. So, I think when you invest in having those people understand either data or how you're thinking about the data or how you're thinking about the problem that pays huge dividends. Then last year, we have a big mentality around growth at Mozart, professional growth, personal growth, all of those things. And I think growth, obviously, my career at parts was working in sort of growth marketing, but I think growth is also another one that's a little bit counterintuitive. Which is ,the more someone grows it doesn't distract them from the core of what they're doing. It actually, there is no substitution. It actually just adds more and more and more richness to their capabilities and also their willingness to invest in something. So, sort of growth ties nicely with pay it forward. Peter, thank you very much. This is wonderful. Congratulations on your recent four million dollar seed round for Mozart Data. I told you before that I'm already upset that we did this a couple of weeks too late because I wish we could have gotten in there. But really, congratulations. And I love your take on things. And particularly I get inspired by people's journeys where they become, they experience these growing pains over, over shared experiences, eventually culminating in this aha moment that they have internally and then bring it out to the world. So, thank you for the inspiration for that. And stay safe and stay healthy. Same to you. I enjoyed it.
