1
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,500
All right. Ron Diamont,
thank you so much

2
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
for joining me
on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
Gladly. I'm happy to be here.

4
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,500
All right I cannot wait to learn
over these next 20 minutes or so

5
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,500
about leadership and tech,
about what it's like being a very,

6
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,500
very, very early employee
like you were at Annapurna.

7
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,500
And you know, your incredible
experiences being a tech lead

8
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,500
at various very well-known
companies, I think most recently,

9
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,500
AWS, right?,
within Amazon.

10
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,500
So let's dive in.
Ron, tell me a little bit

11
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
about who you are.
Take me all the way back

12
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
to your time at the Technion,
you're doing your

13
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
bachelors and masters
and let's go from there.

14
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
All right. Cool.
So yeah, I did

15
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,500
I was in Academic Reserve.
I did my bachelor's

16
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,500
in electrical engineering
in the Technion.

17
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,500
After that, I went to the military,
worked as an engineer

18
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,500
for a couple of years.
During that time,

19
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
I did my master's as well.
I actually studied a lot

20
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,000
in my military service.
I enjoyed it quite a lot.

21
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,500
I know that many academic reserves
don't like that time so much,

22
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,500
but I enjoyed it.
After that I went,

23
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
after the military service,
I went to work

24
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,900
for an Israeli company
called Zoran,

25
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,500
a semiconductor company,
where I was doing

26
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,500
mostly math stuff.
So kind of an intersection

27
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,500
of mathematics and engineering.
So, error correction codes,

28
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,500
security applications,
and all things that are

29
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,500
kind of math related.
After a while,

30
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,500
Zoran got acquired by CSR,
a British company.

31
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,000
And with that, I found myself
moving to a startup that was,

32
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,500
in the very early days
if I recall correctly

33
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,900
I was employee number seven there.

34
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,500
Wow.

35
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
Startup was

36
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,500
it's called Annapurna Labs.
After about four years,

37
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,000
Annapurna got acquired by AWS,
which was interesting

38
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
especially with my previous
acquisition experience,

39
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
which wasn't that positive.
But that acquisition with AWS

40
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,300
was actually quite amazing.
AWS is a great technology

41
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,300
playground and we can talk
about that a little bit.

42
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:16,000
And since then I'm in AWS.
I actually got the chance

43
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,300
to initiate a product for AWS,
machinery related,

44
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,500
and maybe we can talk
about it later as well.

45
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,000
Incredible.

46
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,300
Did they disclose the deal
of the acquisition for Annapurna?

47
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,700
There is enough
information online, yeah.

48
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,300
Enough information online.
So I'm gonna have

49
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,300
to attach it afterwards

50
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,300
at the top

51
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,700
But you know, I have to ask
what is it like being

52
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,300
a very early employee
at a place like Annapurna?

53
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,300
I mean that's a very different
experience from being

54
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,300
a founder of the company.
You've essentially been

55
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,700
in the same room as them,
practically from the very very

56
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,300
very first days, yet you had
very different experiences.

57
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,300
So talk to me a little bit about
what's it like being

58
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,300
a very early employee.

59
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,300
First of all, I

60
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,300
highly, highly recommended it
especially if you're joining

61
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,300
a founding team that is
experienced and know

62
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,300
what they're doing.
It's a great experience.

63
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,300
So, I would say
it's scary at the beginning.

64
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,300
Yeah.

65
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,300
It's scary because
you take your,

66
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,300
you typically reduce
your salary a little bit.

67
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,800
You join a team that you don't know
how things will play out with.

68
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,300
You don't have a defined role.
You do whatever is needed.

69
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,300
Right.

70
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,300
But it's a blast.
I mean you, instead of

71
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,300
being very focused in one
of the big companies like,

72
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,300
I won't mention other
companies' names actually,

73
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,300
but instead of being
very focused on your day job,

74
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,300
you get to do whatever task
is needed at the time.

75
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,300
And if you are willing to go out
of your comfort zone,

76
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,300
you go out of your comfort zone
all the time.

77
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,700
So, I was hired to do one thing.
I think I did everything else

78
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,300
in the company other than
the thing I was hired to do.

79
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,300
I learned a lot during these years.
I learned a lot

80
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,300
from the founders who were,
these guys were experienced.

81
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,300
They were VPs in Marvell
prior to founding Annapurna Labs.

82
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,700
All in all, I think
it was a blast.

83
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,300
And one thing that
I keep telling other folks

84
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,300
is that what's different
between a startup and a big company

85
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,000
is that when you're in a startup,
everyone wants for everyone else

86
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,300
to succeed because you succeed
and fail together.

87
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,300
And in a big company,
that's not exactly the vibe

88
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,300
that you're getting
and the entire day-to-day

89
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,300
becomes completely different
once you work as a team

90
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,300
and try to succeed together.

91
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,300
Incredible.
So how long did you spend

92
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,300
at Annapurna
as employee number seven?

93
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:42,300
So Annapurna grew very quickly.
I spent four years in Annapurna

94
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,300
from joining until we got acquired.
But Annapurna grew

95
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:53,300
from seven to about 25
in a matter of six months.

96
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,300
Wow!

97
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,300
And from there,
in the next two to three years,

98
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,700
we grew to 120.
And today, we're way more than that

99
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,300
but I cannot disclose the number
because it's internal data.

100
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,300
Wow. Incredible.
Okay. And so at the end,

101
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,300
you're saying on one hand,
you joined an early-stage startup.

102
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,300
It's a lot of fun.
You're a part of the team.

103
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,300
It's not really defined.
It's not structured, so you get,

104
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,300
it's like a big playground.
And you get to be a part of,

105
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,700
hopefully, a very nice
success story like

106
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,300
the acquisition to AWS.
But the alternative,

107
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,300
the drawback is that
it's more risky,

108
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,300
you usually take a pay cut
for that potential, you know,

109
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,300
milestone later on, right?

110
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,300
Absolutely.
But what I would recommend

111
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,300
for junior engineers is to
not think about the short-term

112
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,300
salary or compensation.
Think about the long-term

113
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,300
just and the amount that you will
learn in a small company

114
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,300
as in a startup

115
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,300
is way higher than what you will
learn in a big company.

116
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,300
Right, definitely.
But then I mean

117
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,300
you can't just go and
it almost seems irresponsible

118
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,300
to just go and join
any early-stage startup

119
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,300
because it seems exciting.
I mean at the end you do

120
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,700
want some stability
and a lot of early-stage

121
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,300
startups today,
I mean they don't automatically

122
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,300
offer you compensation.
So what are your tips on sort of,

123
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,300
you know, balancing the two ideas
and what type of due diligence

124
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,300
can you do on an early-stage
company before joining?

125
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,300
So my

126
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,700
I don't know if I have a very

127
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,300
well-thought set of tips
but I can tell about my story.

128
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,300
I want to know your experience.

129
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,300
Yeah. So, what I did is

130
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,300
I started

131
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,700
When Zoran got acquired,
I figured that this is not going

132
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,300
in the right direction.
And that's one recommendation

133
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,300
that I can give.
Don't look only at your day-to-day.

134
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,300
Think about where the company
is going long-term.

135
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,300
Right.

136
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,300
Once I saw that this is not
going in the right direction,

137
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,700
I started looking.
And I was pretty young.

138
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,700
I wanted to experience a startup.
So, one of the things

139
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,700
that I started doing
is to look at startups

140
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,700
that are out there today.
And I was just looking

141
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,700
at the newspaper,
asking folks around.

142
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,700
When I, all of a sudden,
heard about Annapurna.

143
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,700
What excited me there is,
first of all, they were

144
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,700
in very early days.
I think they were in one month

145
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,700
after being founded.

146
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,700
Wow

147
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,000
The second thing that
I noted immediately

148
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,700
is that the founders
were folks with a significant

149
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,700
experience and
very well-established record.

150
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,200
Right.

151
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,200
That was a good sign for me.
And the third thing that

152
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,200
I noticed is that the

153
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,300
Bond?

154
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,300
Sorry, the chairman of the board,
the person that gave them

155
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,700
the seed money
was a well-known person

156
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,300
in the semiconductor industry.

157
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:37,900
Okay.

158
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,300
Avigdor Willenz.

159
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,300
He has a record of
founding companies

160
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,300
that eventually become successful.

161
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,300
Wonderful.

162
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,300
These were good signs for me.

163
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,300
I also went
and talked with my dad.

164
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,300
My dad works in the field
and he knew

165
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,300
all these folks and said,
"Thumbs up from me.

166
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,300
I know these guys.
These guys know

167
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,300
what they're doing.
Go for it" and I went.

168
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,300
I love it. I love it.
Okay. At the end,

169
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,300
that's the most important
advice: talk to dad.

170
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,700
They have the best
advice in the end

171
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,300
from experience.

172
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,000
But Ron, then you
transitioned to AWS.

173
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,700
So now, you're a part of a much
larger organization

174
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,000
and it's no longer,
you know, you're no longer

175
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
just employee number seven
but you, and while you may be

176
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,300
leading your
own product within AWS,

177
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
I mean you're still part
of a new culture.

178
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,000
You have to adapt
and assimilate into a whole new,

179
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,300
you know, type of company.
How is that progression like

180
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,000
and what are some of the
challenges that go with it?

181
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,300
So first of all,
immediately after acquisition,

182
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,300
you have a big shock
because all of a sudden,

183
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,700
there's all this terminology

184
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,300
and terminology and culture
that you are not familiar with.

185
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,300
Right.

186
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,300
And you're starting
to study quite a lot.

187
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,300
And basically coming up
to speed very quickly.

188
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:51,000
It's very natural,
in my experience,

189
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,700
at least, to feel
like the dumbest person

190
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,300
in the room immediately
after acquisition,

191
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,300
because everyone has
the experience of

192
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,300
the previous years
and you're coming in

193
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,300
completely fresh.
- Right.

194
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,300
What I would
recommend is, first of all,

195
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,300
learn as quickly
and as much as you can.

196
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,300
But on the other hand,
don't take things without

197
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,300
applying some judgment.
So, there were things

198
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,300
that I liked about the AWS culture.
There were things that I didn't

199
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,300
like about AWS culture.
And I think it was

200
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,300
the correct thing for me,
at least, to integrate

201
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,300
with the stuff that
I could connect with

202
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,300
and not blindly go
with everything that I saw,

203
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,300
and be patient.
At the end of the day you need to know

204
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,000
the people, you need to know
the technology,

205
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,300
you need to know the history,
and then you can function.

206
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,300
Totally. Okay.
So let's move on to this idea

207
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,300
of team execution,
lean execution,

208
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,300
and what makes
or breaks a good team,

209
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,700
not just about whether people
like each other or whether

210
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,300
they have a good time
in the office but also about

211
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,300
actually executing products,
because you've seen

212
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,300
the good and the bad.
So talk to me a little bit

213
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,700
about what are some
of the key takeaways

214
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,300
of a good engineering team.

215
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,300
So I think a lot of it
is about ownership.

216
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,300
So what I see in different teams
is when people own things

217
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,300
from beginning to end,
things tend to converge

218
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,300
much more smoothly.
So what I see in many things

219
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,300
that are not delivering
very quickly is that everyone

220
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,300
has their role and their doing
what they're asked to do,

221
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,300
and that's it.
They stop with,

222
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,300
they stop their
responsibility there.

223
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,300
They don't continue to check
with the next person in line,

224
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,300
whether they got everything
that they needed,

225
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,300
whether it's working
for them and so on.

226
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,000
One thing that I like to do is,

227
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,300
first of all,
make sure that people

228
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:39,300
that are working on a product,
own this product from A to Z,

229
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,300
even things that
they don't do themselves.

230
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,300
And it takes some iterating
with people to get

231
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,700
into that mentality,
but when people do it,

232
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,300
first of all, it's way more fun
because you don't just execute

233
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,700
on tasks.
You basically own

234
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,700
the entire product.

235
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,700
You feel like the product is yours.

236
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,000
That's a big advantage.
The other thing

237
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,700
that you see
is that there are way

238
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,300
less miscommunications
because when people are

239
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,300
people are not just building
a product to a certain

240
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,300
specification, but rather
actually speaking

241
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,300
with their customer,
whether it's local in the team

242
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,300
or another team,
and understanding their needs,

243
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,300
understanding whether the product
that they receive

244
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,300
actually meets their goals
and so on.

245
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,300
And that makes a huge difference.
I would say

246
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,300
that's my number one.
My number two,

247
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,700
and that's probably debatable,
but I don't believe

248
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,300
in overly documenting things.
I think projects move fast

249
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,300
if you don't know everything
in the beginning of the project.

250
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,300
If you try to document
every decision that

251
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,300
you're going to make,
and then you try to execute

252
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,300
that to that specification,
by the time you start executing,

253
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,300
the entire specification
became irrelevant because

254
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,300
the industry is moving forward.

255
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,000
So that's about
the lean part of it, right?

256
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,300
Exactly.
So I strongly believe

257
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,300
in doing 50 percent
of the specification work,

258
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,300
working based on
gut feeling, understanding

259
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,300
of the overall direction,
but starting to execute

260
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,300
while keeping on iterating
and closing the rest of the -

261
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,300
But is that feasible
within a large organization

262
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,300
like AWS when you,

263
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,300
inevitably, you have these
best practices and conventions

264
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,300
in place because you have to align,
you know, thousands of engineers?

265
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,300
It's feasible but you need
to be clever about it.

266
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,300
So I think you don't always say,
"Hey, listen, I have fifty percent

267
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,300
of the product specified.
Go execute."

268
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,700
That doesn't work.
But you say,

269
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,700
"Okay, I have a specification.
Here's the specification."

270
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,700
And we make sure
that the team starts to execute

271
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,300
with the portion
of the specification

272
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,700
that you actually
have high confidence in.

273
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,700
And you also do communicate
that there are some unknowns

274
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,700
that you're still working on,
but as long as you close

275
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,700
the unknowns before they get
to executing it,

276
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,700
I think that's it's doable.

277
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,700
Definitely.
So how many of these

278
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,700
How many different teams
and products would you say

279
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,700
that you've worked
on over the years?

280
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,700
That's a good question.
I would say roughly six

281
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,700
or seven chips that I worked on.

282
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,700
Wow

283
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,700
And they all are very similar
and very different from each other.

284
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,700
So it's an interesting
thing to ponder on.

285
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,700
I'm sure.
And then

286
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,700
So what's the role of the leader
of an organization,

287
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,700
a small organization,
that needs to execute

288
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,700
on a product?
So fine, so you have,

289
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,700
you know, the engineers are,
you know, they're working,

290
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,700
they're lean, they're documenting
not documenting

291
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,700
but what's the role
of the team lead

292
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,700
or the technical leader
of such a product?

293
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,700
So I think,
first of all,

294
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,000
the technical leader
or the team leader

295
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,700
if everyone sees them as a leader,
they already made a mistake.

296
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,700
They need to drive the culture
where decisions are made

297
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,700
in a distributed manner.

298
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,700
Okay

299
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,700
If every single decision
gets escalated up,

300
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,700
you already

301
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,700
the team doesn't scale.
You already made a mistake.

302
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,700
The second thing in my mind
is to drive the culture

303
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,300
of the team.
First of all, collaboration

304
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,700
Second, being very focused
on execution.

305
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,000
So, one thing that happens
in many engineering

306
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,700
organization is endless debates
on the best way to do things.

307
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,700
I think you need to drive
a culture in the team

308
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,700
where you spend your time
on what actually matters.

309
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,300
And if there are a couple
of decisions that

310
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,700
will move the needle
by one percent,

311
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,700
just make a decision,
move on even if

312
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,700
it's the wrong decision.
No big deal.

313
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,700
The third thing,
I would say,

314
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,700
is constant prioritization
and communication across the team.

315
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,300
So a project is complex,
you don't know exactly

316
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,300
what you're getting into
at the beginning of the project.

317
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,300
So there's no way
you can prioritize

318
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,700
all the tasks
for the next year and a half.

319
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,700
And I'm talking chip products
that take a year

320
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,700
and a half to execute.
You cannot prioritize

321
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,300
the entire thing at day one.
So you need to constantly go in

322
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,700
and prioritize, especially because
as the chip,

323
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,700
as the project nears an end,
you're going to give up

324
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,300
on some features.
So it's better that these will be

325
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:10,700
the less important features.
And it's endless, right?

326
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,700
Communication across the team,
I think, is also key

327
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,700
Making sure that people
actually understand

328
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,300
so that they make
the right decision

329
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,700
in their everyday

330
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,700
in their day-to-day.
So I spend, I guess,

331
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,300
30 percent of my time
just explaining things

332
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,700
to every single engineer
that is willing to listen

333
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:32,700
because I think, eventually,
it's worth it.

334
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,700
People make better
decisions based on that.

335
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,700
Do you
So this idea of foregoing

336
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,700
some features and leaving and
you know, deferring

337
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,300
the least important ones
to the end

338
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,700
this prioritization
I mean, at the end, that's one

339
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,700
of the hardest things,
I think, to do especially

340
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,700
as a team leader, right?
You have the product,

341
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,700
you have the product specifications,
but you have all these conflicting

342
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,700
notions of what's important,
what's critical,

343
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,300
what's not critical.
And a lot of that is also,

344
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,700
you know, not just about
the product and requirement

345
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,000
but it's about the actual
implementation of the product

346
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
and whether you want to go
the extra mile

347
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,700
implement it better,
or do you want to release it,

348
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,700
you know, a few sprints
ahead of time?

349
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,700
Yeah. So I think
the more, I feel with time that

350
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,200
the more educated I am,
and the more time

351
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,300
I spend into looking
into every point of the project,

352
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,300
the easier it is for
me to prioritize.

353
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,300
So at the beginning,
I would always almost feel

354
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,300
like I'm improvising
and it's really tough

355
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,300
to make the decision.
But if I look in retrospective

356
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,300
it's because I wasn't
educated enough.

357
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,300
I didn't see
all the different disciplines

358
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,300
and how things come together.
As time passes

359
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,300
and I gain more experience,
I can see that

360
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,300
the more that you know,
the easier it is to do it,

361
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,300
and the more comfortable
you feel not taking

362
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,300
every decision yourself
but rather consulting

363
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,300
with the entire team
to make the decision.

364
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,300
Definitely. Okay.
Ron, I have to know,

365
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,300
what excites you most?
So you've done all sorts of things.

366
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,300
You've worked
at a variety of places

367
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,300
but what really
gets you excited about

368
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,300
being an engineer
and leading teams?

369
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,300
It's interesting.
I think the challenge

370
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,300
the challenge is definitely
a big one for me just starting

371
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,300
a new technology,
especially new technologies

372
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,300
which I know nothing about,
just getting into this

373
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,700
technology space,
learning it, and then may

374
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,000
becoming an expert,
and eventually executing

375
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
and building something
that customers like and use.

376
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,700
Definitely the human part of it,
so interacting with smart people,

377
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,700
finding your way
to deliver together as a team,

378
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,300
going through some hardships
during the project

379
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,700
and finding clever ways around it,
whether it's technical

380
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,300
or human related.

381
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,300
So people get frustrated,
people get tired

382
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,300
during a long execution,
and we find

383
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,300
clever ways together.
And one thing that I enjoy the most

384
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,300
is being super open
with the team about it

385
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,300
and just telling them
my considerations

386
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,700
and trying to make
the decision together.

387
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,300
For me, if we get to a point
in the project where we feel

388
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,300
that we reached a problem
and we don't know what to do,

389
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,300
and if I can come into
a conversation

390
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,300
and just ask questions
and the team decides

391
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,700
on the best path forward,
that's a lot of fun.

392
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,700
Fascinating.
Okay. Ron, one or two pieces

393
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,700
of advice you would give
to any engineer that is

394
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,000
starting their journey,
whether it's an early-stage startup

395
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
or a late-stage startup,
but let's say somebody

396
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,700
fresh out of college.
You know, they just got

397
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,700
their bachelor's or master's
in computer science,

398
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,700
they're joining a new company.
What should they keep in mind

399
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,700
most importantly?

400
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,700
I think one, I would say,
is focus on building

401
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,700
your core capabilities.
So too many people

402
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,700
I see are trying to
kind of race through

403
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,700
the career ladder,
become a manager,

404
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,700
and then get
this certain level

405
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,300
or something like that.

406
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,700
I don't think this is the most
important thing in the long term.

407
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,000
In the long term, actually,
if you build capabilities,

408
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,700
you build knowledge
across disciplines,

409
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,700
I think that's worth much more
and you start to accelerate

410
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,700
very quickly later on.
That's one. A second one is

411
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,300
the world became multidisciplinary.

412
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:04,900
You don't

413
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,000
Becoming an expert
in one narrow topic

414
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,300
is not enough anymore.

415
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,300
So try to experience,

416
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,300
to gain experience with

417
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,700
a couple of different disciplines,
whether it's software or hardware.

418
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,300
It could be even broader than that.

419
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,300
A third one is,

420
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,300
and it's related,
but think long term.

421
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,300
Don't think short term.
And a fourth one

422
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,300
is be nice to people.

423
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,700
Make people like you.
Eventually it will pay up.

424
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,700
The most important probably.

425
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,700
Yeah.

426
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,700
And going off of that,
Ron, 20 minutes are up

427
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,700
but I need to know three words
that best describe you.

428
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,300
All right. Let's see if I can
get this one quickly.

429
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,300
The most important question.

430
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,300
The hardest one.

431
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,000
So I think

432
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,700
First of all, I'm adaptable.

433
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,700
If things are thrown my way,
I'll find a way around them,

434
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,700
whether personally
or as a team, when we build things.

435
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:01,700
Second one, I would say,
nice and kind to people.

436
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,700
We work together.

437
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,700
I'm not trying
to compete with them.

438
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,000
I don't hear that often.
It's so important though.

439
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,700
I mean it's such a basic thing.
No matter what you do in life,

440
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,300
no matter the level you are
and the experience you've had,

441
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,300
just being kind and being nice,
being humane

442
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,300
I totally agree with that.
I couldn't agree more.

443
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:22,700
And third one,
I don't know, I find,

444
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,700
it's kind of like adaptable,
but I find a path forward always.

445
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,300
I'm very optimistic.
I know that there will

446
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,700
be a way to succeed.

447
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,700
I love it.

448
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,700
Sounds like the really important
traits of an engineer.

449
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,700
Ron, thank you very much.
Thank you for everything,

450
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,700
for all the inspiration,
for all the knowledge.

451
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,700
I think this is 
hugely relevant to my path,

452
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,700
hugely relevant to a lot
of the people

453
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,700
that are following this show.
And they're also young engineers

454
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,700
on their path and on their journey.
So thank you for your time.

455
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,700
Thank you for having me.

456
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,300
Bye-bye.

457
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:52,900
Bye.
