1 I think it's, you know, it's scary at times because you really are potentially influencing the way hundreds of millions of people think a month. Yair Livne, thank you so much for joining me. How are you? Good, how are you? Wonderful. Where are you calling from right now? I'm in Palo Alto. You're in Palo Alto. And I have to congratulate you on a pretty big transition right after many years of Quora. Also quite a few years, at least 4 years VP of Product. You've recently finished your service there. And you're on to some different things. And I'd love to chat about your experience with Quora and some of the really interesting things that you've done, both that are mainstream today, but also that weren't necessarily mainstream back when you were working on them. But I'd like to start all the way back, going back to Stanford. You're doing your PhD over there in economics and you're working on some really interesting things that I just love, both matching theory and political economy. Tell me a little bit about yourself and what led you to do that research at Stanford. Yeah. A great question. So, I'm curious about economics for years before coming to Stanford. I was doing my BA and master's at the Hebrew U and Jerusalem. And was mixing math and econ throughout. And I was really interested in this kind of intersection where the theory and kind of the beauty of mathematics can be applied to real world problems. Maybe like the epitome of that is Auction Theory, which won the Nobel Prize a few weeks ago. It was kind of motivating, kind of energy coming in. I actually had the chance to be in quite a few lectures by Milgrom this past year. And I have to say that I didn't understand much, but it was still fascinating nevertheless. Yeah, I was in a reading room with him for kind of a couple of years. And it was really fascinating to kind of see him like think and kind of appreciate his point of view on the world. It's quite extraordinary. So, you've doing your research.Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so, I got curious. What else what other kind of beautiful mathematical applications can be used to understand the world or maybe improve the world. And kind of matching markets was a really fascinating thing. It was kind of blowing up. And within economics at the time, people were innovating on matching theory to do things like kidney donations and matching kids to schools in a really efficient way. And some of those kind of techniques were actually implemented then in the kidney donation market or in actual school systems like in Boston, in New York, which were changing how they were running things, using economic theory and with economists as kind of the people planning these systems. So, that was kind of how I got pulled into this area. So, I have to spend some time talking about the beauty of mathematics and, you know, and enlighten both myself and a lot of my viewers that aren't necessarily leaning into the mathematical world. I am, but I know a lot of my friends who are excited about innovation aren't leaning there. How does mathematics play a role into our lives, whether it's matching theory or political economy? I'd love to really understand this world a little bit better and show some of the excitement. Yeah. So, for me, a lot of it comes from and I think that's kind of the modern way to view economics is from incentives. So, if you can describe with a little bit of math, it doesn't need to be super sophisticated what people's preferences are and what kind of outcomes they prefer. Then you can model the world again, with fairly simple primitives and use this description of incentives to predict behavior. And if you can predict behavior, then you can go one step higher and describe what kind of systems would actually push forward better behavior on the part of economic agents. So, in the case of, let's say, school choice, if people have preferences over schools and they want to be matched with a specific school for their kid, and that might involve many different types of considerations, like what are your, you know, the other kids in the family, are they going already to school within the system. What kind of focus areas that that school have and is that a good match for their child or not. How close is the school to where they live. And kind of model all of that out. And again, this is not rocket science. This is just a fairly simple ways of creating kind of list of preferences. Then you can think of, okay, if I ask people and have incentives that are aligned in the sense that the system will actually respect your preferences and give you the best outcome for the preferences you stated, then you can think of designing these systems in a way where matching is "optimal" and you can get the best outcomes for the most like the largest amount of people. So, that's for me, really neat thing where you can take mathematical models and kind of solve them in a way which generate better outcomes for people in their real lives, on the things that matter most to them. 100%. And I have to say that I've been getting exposed to the process of residency and doctors, people in medical school that are getting there. You know, on one hand it seems, yes, matching is a problem. It's a little bit longer. Sometimes it's not ideal. But then, when you meet the person that's actually going through that process and this is not a life threatening situation. Right? Like kidney donations or stuff like that. But you can still see the impact of what mathematics and algorithms can do to help ease the process, let alone save lives. That is beautiful as you mentioned. That is beautiful mathematics. And I'm extremely excited to continue my studies and get to those levels. And then what about the political economy? How does math play into politics and what's coming there? Yeah. So, fun fact there is I got pulled into it through my wife, who is also doing a PhD at Stanford at the same time. And she was in the political science department, but actually had a very similar background from a kind of game theory and mathematics perspective. And we were both kind of curious. This is like again, really good timing because we were doing this kind of pre Arab Spring. But we got really curious on this topic of protests, especially protests in authoritarian regimes. So, these are people who are taking a big chance and risking their lives and going to voice their concerns or their objections to the regime under the threat of arrest or execution. And why are they doing that? What kind of dynamics contribute to them taking that chance? What are they looking to get out of it? And so, we were using a kind of a mix approach of both looking at empirical data, but also building a mathematical model that would try to explain under what conditions, would people actually take that chance and again, take on meaningful cost to get an outcome. And that outcome is political. And so it kind of reached a model where, you know, the economic conditions were often a strong determinant of when protests might happen. And what's the probability of that protest actually having an impact. And again, the timing was really opportune because we were doing this just before the kind of Arab Spring where we saw this actually play out with many, many regimes being toppled or at least shaken by mass protest movements, something that wasn't seen for basically decades. So, when we were originally taking on this research, it was kind of out of vague to study protest because it was like this never happens or this isn't meaningful. And then, a year or two later we saw all of this unfold. So, it was really kind of a fun experience to be thinking about these problems. So, Yair, you're working on these mathematical models. You're thinking about all this and all of a sudden, the Arab Spring happens, and you're watching this. And I have to get into the perspective that you're at, I believe, it's like 2010, 2011. Right? How does this all play out? Are you surprised? Does this research take on a greater role? What happens there? Yeah. So I, we definitely were surprised. Again, this was not something that we had seen since probably the fall of the Soviet Union, where people work on toppling regimes by going out into the streets. So, it was a shock. I mean, it is kind of very relevant or eerily similar to what the dynamics we described in our papers, because ultimately the logic was kind of very simple. Things get kind of bad enough from an economic perspective where people are desperate enough, they'll take that chance. That was the heart of the model. But really connecting it to the empirics and actually kind of being able to predict, this was the neat part of the research. And so, it was both surprising, but very kind of consistent, at the same time. And I kind of, both my wife and I were in the process of kind of leaving academia. But for the professor we were working with in the political science department, this was a very good boost for her career. Unbelievable. So, you're at that point, you're leaving academia and you have a series of different experiences throughout your professional career leading up to your job at Quora now. I know Quora as this beautiful website that I go to, to answer all of the relevant and irrelevant questions that I may have. But walk me through a little bit of your life path that led to being VP of Product at such an awesome company. Yeah. So, it may seem random, but I think there is a thread connecting everything, or at least I'd like to believe so. So for me, kind of what I've enjoyed or what I've been attracted to is how do we kind of again, use kind of math or logic to unlock a lot of value. And that's something that's kind of always driven me or I was passionate about. And with Quora as an economist, this is actually a fascinating thing to dive into because you can think about Quora, and I think this is true of knowledge more generally as a market. There are people who need certain answers to certain questions. Those may be very important or trivial. That's all fine. And the other people in the world who know about the answers to those and kind of how do you connect the two sides of this market and how do you unlock value and how do you create the right incentives for people to be kind of sharing that online in a public way. That was like the key question that motivated me. And actually my first project I got put on was we had what to consider the time that we later deprecated called Quora Credits, which was a way for people to accumulate kind of virtual money. This is kind of pre Bitcoin. Everything about virtual money. So, accumulate this kind of point system and be able to spend it by asking people directly for their answers on a question. So, you basically got an ability to kind of buy someone's attention by sending them a notification and an email saying, hey, can you answer this question. And so each person had kind of a dynamic price of how much is their attention worth. And that was based on supply and demand dynamics in the marketplace. And again, if you are a good member of the community and you supply value yourself, then you were able to kind of utilize that and kind of get value or get knowledge out of somebody else's head. That was kind of a beautiful concept to me. And something that really pulled me into working for the company. Wow. So, you know, a marketplace of knowledge in an age of misinformation. You know, you're VP of Product, I believe, all the way back from 2016. Right? You're seeing what has happened with the election and when I look on social media and those sorts of areas, it's very hard for me not to be pessimistic about, about where we're headed with, with misinformation. And it's almost like a promise to myself that I'll only really accept knowledge when I see it cross sectioning from various sources, and I take pride in that. But how do you, as VP of Product, approach this mentality that we have a real issue on our hands and it's growing exponentially? Right? I mean, it's getting out of control. Yeah. That's a great question. And I think for us, like, while we were actually very kind of in some sense validated by all of this happening, that this is kind of sounds ironic. But we at that point had been worried about, you know, kind of misinformation or just generally what's true or not for many years. For us, you know, our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge. And by that we mean real knowledge that is useful to people. Misinformation is something that undermines, as you were saying, people's trust and knowledge. So, for us, that was an existential threat if the platform can be manipulated into showing prominently or spreading information, that's not actually true. That undermines trust in the platform. That reduces the incentive for people to start search for knowledge. And because of this marketplace that I was describing, it also reduces the incentives of good people to actually share the right information because there's all this other junk out there that might drown out what they are saying or what they are sharing. So for us, we were thinking about this problem years earlier. One of the key moments for me in that journey was we had to digest email or still have to digest email. It's a more popular kind of emails out there that go out and hundreds of millions of people and has personalized information for them, something we had invested a lot in. And there was I believe this was in 2014 or 2015, we had sent out to, if I remember correctly, hundreds of thousands or a few million people and answer at the top of their email that had basically kind of a 9/11 conspiracy theory content in it like feature prominently. And that was like a real wake up moment of hey, we're approaching this purely algorithmically with all these algorithms that trying to understand what people like, but we do this on the basis of fairly kind of shallow signals like clicks and uploads, we may fall into these traps. And we really have to put in some guardrails and make sure that we don't let that kind of, "information to take over". And so, we have been thinking about this for years before the election and for us kind of seeing the rest of the industry suddenly realized, hey, there's a massive kind of problem here and we should start kind of being a lot more careful about "free speech", was again, validating in some sense because we had been working on this for years. Wow. That's a lot of responsibility, isn't it? To sit in that chair and understand that the things that you're working on are the core of information? Absolutely. I mean, I think it's scary at times because you really are potentially influencing the way hundreds of millions of people think a month and that those, you know, subtle nudges towards believing things aren't true are risky from a political perspective, social stability perspective, medical advice, like all these areas are hyper important to people's lives. And if you're pushing the wrong stuff out there, that is the opposite of our mission. That is dangerous. And so, that's kind of a fear or concern. Again, we were occupied with for a long time. And it's just to call that and be kind of a little charitable to other platforms is a really kind of tricky area. You don't want to, it's very hard to be the voice of truth and be an arbiter of every little fact. We're talking about millions and millions of answers a week. What's true or not. Nobody can kind of sift through that and make a decision. You even saw this with the pandemic where the early information that the most credible agencies were pushing out was actually false. And at that time is very hard to make that call. So, you need to strike this balance of allowing debate and allowing enough spectrum of views to kind of have its fight out there and kind of have that evolution of ideas. But at the same time, the stuff that's kind of intentionally false or deliberately misleading or is kind of the conspiracy theory realm, have a really hard line there and have the mechanisms in place where you can squash that when it arises. So, it's really unfair that I'm asking you this when we have literally a minute and a half to the interview, but where are we headed? What needs to happen so that when I watch as I watch my niece, who is six years old, as she grows up and she gets more into social media and she's so curious, how can I help her? How can the world help her gain curiosity in the right way? Yeah. I think that's a really key question. And I think that, you know, this is a really interesting intersection of regulation, kind of a corporate responsibility on the side of platforms. And frankly, a lot more, I think, debate that needs to happen there. So, I don't have like a magic bullet, but I do think platforms need to spend a lot more thought and time about kind of striking that balance and making sure their algorithms don't kind of trend or have these feedback loops that end up in these places where people become convinced of flat earth theories for real. Because of like some rabbit hole they went down through YouTube. So, I honestly think that the right solution is some regulation, potentially not a massive amount, but a lot more kind of corporate effort to kind of squash these pockets of the Internet that are really dangerous. Right. And we've obviously seen the sensitivity behind this, the intersection between regulation and private companies and what's happening, especially as we've seen in the most recent election, as some of Twitter's action, some of Facebook's actions that even a single action could like flagging a comment by an official in the White House says something that maybe not correct, that stirs up some very meaningful conversations about the foundation of what is the responsibility of these private companies. As well as what is the responsibility for their own company, but also for the citizens and for the integrity of a free and fair election or democracy. Yair, I want to thank you for being so kind with your time and so generous. I can go on this for another two hours because everything that we've touched here is so fascinating and so remarkable. So, thank you for sharing that with me. Before we leave, I have to ask you for three words that you would use to describe yourself. Optimistic, persistent and curious. So, after all of that, optimistic, persistent and curious. I just love it. Thank you so much, Yair. This was just wonderful. Toda raba. Thank you so much.
