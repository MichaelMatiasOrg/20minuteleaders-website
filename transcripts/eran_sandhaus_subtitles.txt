Eran Sandhaus, thank you for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Thank you for having me, Michael. I am so excited, so excited because I'm gonna get so much inspiration now about mobility, about your experience as an entrepreneur, as a board member and advisor, but most importantly about where we're headed as a community of innovators past covid-19. Eran, lets start. Who are you? Besides the fact that I know you from J-Ventures and all the fun that we have there, who are you? Wow. What a big question, Michael. Well, let me try to summarize it maybe in a few words. So, what I'm really passionate about, I would say, is the human spirit. Okay? Who I am is I like to, first of all, I really love technology. I believe in technology. And I'm someone that likes to make things happen in ways that are highly accelerated, which is why technology is important for me. And the other thing that I really care about is people. And I would say that on the combination of two of those things. Okay. That's at the very high level. Let me show it to the rest of my journey. the rest of my journey. Okay. So you started out in semiconductors and in Texas Instruments and Qualcomm, you find your way more to an entrepreneurial position and very excited about mobility. What is it about the entrepreneurial mindset and mobility that really got you excited? Yeah. So, as you said, I started my career in semiconductors and I ended up almost by mistake getting into mobility. So, the common denominator in my career in the semiconductor space is that the early years were engineering. But the last decade I've managed all the businesses and all of them were about creating a startup inside the large multinational. I was the crazy Israeli guy that you say, "Okay. Bring this guy, so he can make this vision" So, how can we grow the company? How can we create big business? So, I come in, I parachute in. Get the layout the land, recruit the team, start to grow. And I've done this for a very long time because I really enjoyed the scale and the breadth of what you can do with the global scale, with the large multinational. And the daily great career for quite some time, about 18 years. But two and a half years ago, I actually, So, this was about 15 years of my career. And right after that, what happened is I got recruited to move into mobility. So, they'll say at automotive we come looking for someone to lead our autonomous vehicle business. I met with the CEO and we really hit it off with a great chemistry. And I asked him one question, "Why you're interested to hire someone like me?" "Because I'm not from your business." "I came from Sydney." He said, "It's very simple." "I look for someone who's in the work were very conservative." "Would think about safety." "I want someone with a mindset just making things happen and has no fear." Okay? Now, when is this? Around when are we? This was the end of 2016. 2016. Okay. So, right at the end of 2016. And I came out of the room. I got a call from the recruiter an hour later that said they want me. And because fundamentally, they figured out that if they would have me on board, I can help create a business, which again, most people told me would be crazy. And I took the job and I fell in love with that mission. You know, when you think about self-driving cars, that the premise behind it, as I said, I really care about the social impact as well. You know, it started with reducing the casualties. There's over one million people dying every single day, 40,000 in the US, I'm sorry, it's every single year. Yeah. And 40,000 people in the US alone, or normally, not with Corona. Every single year. 40,000 people in the world. Every single year 40,000 people in the US dies from accidents. It's literally like a 747 going down every day. Okay. So, this is a major, major thing. And by the way, most of the one million people are coming from Asia. Of course, it's more people living there. But there's a lot to be done. So, you know what? It was very compelling for me and for the team that they built was how can we go to truly save lives? And the second piece that is really appealing the box about mobility it's about reducing the costs of travel. The cost of movement. And if you think about what is it's movements, it's enabling people that are outside of the cities, that are living far away, that don't have access. All of a sudden, it becomes affordable for them to connect to the city to get employment. Okay. So, this is something that could literally reshape what it is to have like a city, what it is to live in a suburb, what it is to be outside. Also, some you get connected. Right. It also tries the time to be productive the time that you travel. So, I'd love to get your insight into because you're an expert in the industry, and you're an advisor and a board member of a bunch of these companies that are making groundbreaking work in mobility and autonomous vehicles. Yet here we are in 2020. We've been hearing about this notion of autonomous vehicles, autonomous mobility for quite some time. I've talked to quite a few people in a variety of these edge technology companies, and it seems like we're at the 95% stage. And that extra five percent is very, very difficult. And we're not gonna get it on the road until we get that five percent. Is that the case? What's happening today? Sure. So, I don't think where the 95% or the 80% stage. So, there's a lot more to be done. I'm really bummed out right now. I was very optimistic coming in here. But let me tell you, whenever this group lead into delta and we believe that by 2020 or 2022, there'll be self-driving cars everywhere, ubiquitous. Not only you. A lot of people thought that. Right. And a short while after I came in, I realize that that's not gonna happen. There was a lot of stuff hat has to be resolved. However, when you think about it, it's probably it's not gonna happen the way that people wanted. But it is gonna happen in a different way. And it's gonna go sooner than people think now. And what I mean by that is originally people thought that their using Uber and Lyft, it's gonna go self-driving car. That's it. Okay, 2022, a very like percentage. That's not the case. However, you can now take the same set of capabilities that have been developed for that market and apply them in other places that are a very profitable, lucrative and very relevant. So, for example, one of them is trucking. Okay. When you start to think about it, there are already businesses with built business models that you can start to automate and make money today. They're very relevant. So trucking is an industry that there's a shortage of drivers. There's a lot of things that you can do once you start to move to self-driving trucks [--] Also, some things have been really easy has a lot of networks. And the other thing, by the way, a lot of people started to pivot away from doing the self-driving taxis to delivery robots. Started two years and now you can start to see pilots already going on. And with Postmix, for example, both in LA and San Francisco, they moved to deliveries with driverless robots. You can see also in downtown Mountain View, lot of stores doing that. Wow. And so, that trend is gonna start to look different than what we thought. But it is coming sooner. And personally, I'm also working with the world's largest public transportation company. And though also working publicly on the project now for 50 pilots, 50 pilots globally. Or a self-driving shuttles In different location. Amazing. The point of what I'm trying to say is if you start to narrow down what it is that you do, this problem starts to be manageable. And also, people are doing now. So was the problem that five, 10 years ago, people were making these huge remarks and huge aspirations of every car in the world is gonna be autonomous. And now we're just narrowing it down into manageable pieces. Is this the transition the worst thing? Yeah. What happened is a natural process in the market, there's like a shakeout for product market fit. So, buying a bunch of product the companies went to minimum value products. Most companies pivoted to where the money is at. And therefore we started to see things going into agriculture. Mining is also going up. Construction. I must offer operations that they're going to inside of warehouses, for e-commerce is booming. All of that started to really grow rapidly. And you still have companies that are doing robotaxis. So, mobilizer working on it. You've got suits that have been required by Amazon Auroras. There are a bunch of companies, but they're going to take longer. So, it's just being separated from this huge monolithic thing that we're going to see 100% to the spectrum of things out there. I love it. Eran, what's happening now? You know, we're in the midst of covid-19, we all hope that it would end just as fast as it came, it's not gonna end anytime soon. We're experiencing all these new realities. I'm fascinated every day thinking about how our world is changing and the workforce is changing. And I know that I'm going to build my own venture sooner rather than later. And I'm constantly thinking about what is my role coming out or being a part of covid-19. You wrote a fascinating piece on Medium about our role as innovators through covid-19. What's your mindset about this? What is our collective responsibility as entrepreneurs and innovators? Right. So, thank you for mentioning that. The main point that I made in that article, when I look back at the crises that I experienced in 2000 and 2008, those fears were extremely difficult and challenging in many ways. But on the other end, it really forced me to reckon with, what can I do to stay on top and to innovate. And really have a profitable business. So, talk to me what happened in 2008. Because that's also a really cool story. Sure. So, in 2008, I was working for Texas Instruments for TI and we're selling chips, to cellphone companies. And we had a really good business. With a very good and diverse business. But as you can imagine, when there's a crisis, everything goes down. So, in a short period of time, our revenue went down to pretty much to zero. And we had hundreds of employees on our payroll globally. So, it was a very scary turnaround. I would say as a person that is managing this group, we had to go through layoffs. It was very difficult as well. But we knew that it was not going to be the end. And since I also had a strategy team under my command, they said, "Okay, let's go figure out." "Let's get in the room, okay." While we go through all of this very difficult period, let's think about what we can create what we can envision. And we decided to go outside of our four corners and we invited speakers. We brought speakers who are like forward thinkers and everything, researchers. And we sit together and we came upon, one of them started to mention this whole notion on machine to machine. Okay. That one day machines will start to be connected and communicate with each other. And you know, it really strung our imagination, because if we created this wireless chips that you put in a phone, what if you could actually take the same devices and that $100 million investment that we do every year to generate these devices And now start to put in everything. So think about thermostats, doorbells, security cameras. You know, these, I mean, today it sounds like a default. Of course everything is connected. But back then, in 2008, in the middle of a great economic recession. Not as default. Right. So, it did not exist. What it causes, it kind of reckon us to think about what if we could do something different? And we literally inside of this entire huge issue, we recruited a team of business reinforced to go after chasing all these people out there to find out what's out there. Kind of like sending the dove in the middle of the flood. And they went out and they came back with an analysis. Here's a market that we can do. There's another one. We should go after automotives and everyone offer some personal visual, was a whole burst of energy. So, in the midst of that crisis, we all started to get really excited by that vision. And 12 months later, we had a business unit in place. We started to allocate engineering resources. That was 2008 marked the beginning of how we brought Internet of Things into Texas Instruments. We ended up engaging with with some of the top guys between Google and Apple and all these guys, because no one would start to brainstorm with them about the stakes. So, it was actually one of the most productive years that we had that. A decade later that business became a booming business. And so, that the company started at that point. So, my takeaway as an entrepreneur here is you have a huge crisis on your hand, your current businesses shut down and you're almost forced to make a decision. You either sit down and wait and moan in dismay, or you can say, "Okay, well, let's take this time to understand the world better." Pivot if necessary and discover things that we might not have been able to see otherwise because we never allocated the energy and the mindfulness to be exposed to them. Right. That's exactly the point. You never have the opportunity to address a good crisis. That was something that was said by one of the Obama advisors. Right awhile back. Never waste a good crisis. Never waste a good crisis. So when you think about it, that was the point of the article I made, which is, when I look back in 2030, okay, that's the challenge I gave to everyone at the end of the article. Yes. When I look back at 2030, what is it that we'll be doing on 2020 that I'll be proud of? What is it that you'll be doing now that you can look back and say, "Oh, my God. That was something that I created in this period of time. 100%. 100%. So Eran,  one of the things that I've got to know over these past few months through J-Ventures is your kindness and your motivation to have social impact and social good. What does that mean to have social impact, especially now in our world when it's a very capitalistic and we're constantly chasing our next goals and our next titles and possessions? What is our responsibility also for social impact? Well, I don't know what's our responsibility, but I'll share with you where am at at this journey, okay? You know, a few weeks ago, actually, I was very fortunate to attend the session that they organized with Sir Ronald Cohen. It was about four or five weeks ago. And he spoke about social impact. And it really struck a chord with me. So, I'm with Julia right now to really figure out what could be done with this. And what was interesting about these combinations, for the first time in my life, I've figured out that the two worlds of social impact and entrepreneurship and financial impact can actually be joined together into something. What made me truly interesting in the talk with Ronald Cohen was that he was talking about what's really missing in the world is capitalism today. And the world that corporations are acting is that they're not measured in any way, shape or form, really, on the social impact. Some of them they issue reports and stuff. But in reality, they really measure their financial impact. And in the process, they can cause a lot of harm in all angles. Now, what is done was not the case. What if there was a scale literally that you could measure and quantify dollar wise the social impact of the company. Well, that's a fascinating concept. If you do that, you eventually start to transform the playing field. So, that's it. That's in the realm of large companies and the same thing applies for investment. Well, what if we could literally deploy capital not only invest in companies that would be extremely financially successful, but in the process, with great, amazing social returns. And I think that that world is really fascinating. There was not the words that there's multiple trillions of dollars that are already operating in this space, like BlackRock and being [--] and there are already some VC firms. So, for me, when I'm thinking about 2030, I want to be able to look back and say, "Okay, I've created the dent inside the trend." Because there's something that's for me personally, I think it's very directionally correct. Of course. So, as I'm starting my journey as a young entrepreneur and a lot of my friends from Stanford and 8200 who are joining me on this journey now, what are some things with your experience that we can take with us as we're both looking to make a dent financially and make an innovation and make a dent physically in the world, but also with social impact in mind. Because it still seems like there's a pretty big dissonance between the effort that we put into social impact and the effort that we put in to make a successful business. They seem very separated. And I'd love to learn for myself how I can start combining them? Yeah, I think the key element is really to create the business that the core business is the one that creates the social wealth. So, it's not like something that is on the side. It's not something that comes in contradiction. And there are businesses that are 100% social. Those basically the philanthropy realm. There are businesses that are 100% business and there's no social aspects. The interesting part is, can you create a business that is 100% align? So whenever you grow and you sell another unit, you literally start to expand more. Definitely. And that's the way to think about it. And the other aspect which is critical for social impact. It's not enough to have a declaration for that social good. But it's literally taking on and measuring and setting goals. Which is very counter intuitive. This idea of measuring your social impact, not just saying we are a socially conscious company, but actually quantifying how much social impact are we doing? I mean, it sounds like a whole different thing that I don't think that's being taught today in business schools around the world. It sounds like what you're saying is that this is something that should be taught and that should be addressed. Yeah, I personally I think that's the case. In general, I believe that, whatever you cannot measure you cannot manage. Nothing personal. And if you don't set a goal in the future, it doesn't shape your actions in the present. Okay. So, think about it. Any company that you talk to comes with a declaration of what their financial future will look like in the form of their forecast. If you start to literally think that way that you're gonna measure include the social impact out there and measure it backwards, that's going to shape your action. And that's the biggest thing that I will tell you. Don't just settle and work for a company that says we're gonna do good. Because every startup that I see says we're gonna do good. No startup says we're gonna destroy the planet or abuse our employees. Everyone says they do good. But it is a completely different, because I will say not only we're gonna do good, but we're gonna measure it. Okay, we're gonna publish it. And we're gonna seek out investors that want that. By the way, if you do that it was to create a life culture in the company I was just about to think that. Yeah. You have the right set of board members and advisors. People that really want to be there because they really want the mission to succeed in and completely successful. I love it. Eran, we started with mobility I'd love to end with mobility from an aspect of, you've had the privilege of sitting on a number of advisory seats and board seats of a variety of companies who are dealing with mobility. And I'd love to get your take quickly on this idea of not just mobility, but working in an industry that is constantly developing that is really moving the needle in the world. What are some of your earned secrets spending these past few years really understanding this industry and seeing all the different players play a part in it? Yeah, I think the biggest one is really spending the time to understand the pain points. Okay, so, there's a reason why I work within companies. Because I like to understand where are the intersection points between them and  where are the scenes where things are actually not working. So, that's a whole different animal [--]? But what I can tell you is that the main value is not just understanding what works well. But mainly understanding what are the challenges and the one doesn't. That's what's gonna stand the different blocks of the ecosystem, how people collaborate, business models, the value chain also. I love it. Eran, right before we finish, I have to ask the most important question. I need three words that you would use to describe yourself or that Oded would use to describe you or anybody that worked with you would use to describe you. Yeah. I would say Passionate. Socially aware of social impact would be a good one. And the other one I would say Innovator. I love it. It's so not surprising that almost every person I have this show with says passionate. It makes me passionate definitely. Eran, toda raba. Thank you very much. And best of luck with everything. I can't wait to see these things on the street and seeing that the world actually change. And I promise here that I'm gonna look back at this conversation in 2030 to think about social impact in a more quantitative way. And I agree that that's the way to look. I think it's beautiful that every person would love to say, "Yeah, I'm doing good for the world and my company is doing good for the world." I'm taking from this conversation. I wanna find a way to quantify this. When soon I'm gonna start my own venture. So, thank you for that inspiration. Thank you, Michael. Let's create a future. Okay, thanks. Take care.
