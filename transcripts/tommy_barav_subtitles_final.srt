1
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,000
Tommy Barav,
thank you so much

2
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,380
for joining 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,700
Thank you for having me.

4
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,700
It is so great to have you.
I can't wait to talk about

5
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,700
self-optimization.

6
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,700
So, you had a company
called Supertools

7
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,700
and you are a walking super tool.

8
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,000
And Tommy, over the next 20
minutes, I want to learn what

9
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,500
it means to be productive.
I want to learn what it means

10
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,700
to be self-optimized.

11
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,700
First things first,
I need you to stand up

12
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,700
because this is killer.

13
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,700
Just to stand up? Okay.

14
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,700
I'm wearing my pajama.

15
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,700
[laughs]

16
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,700
Yeah.

17
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,700
What is this?

18
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,700
It's a Zoom shirt so I can

19
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,700
so I can be elegant
be elegant while I'm doing Zoom calls,

20
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,700
but you know,
still feel comfortable

21
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,700
wearing my PJs.

22
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,700
So, yeah, you see

23
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,700
In terms of the angle,

24
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,700
you see only the shirt,
but actually, it's like

25
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,700
it's my PJ. I'm only

26
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,300
- Unbelievable -
- I'm working from home, so I -

27
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,000
Yeah my

28
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Actually, my mom
I got it like to send

29
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
a shout-out to my mom because
she made it for me.

30
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,700
So yeah.

31
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,700
Unbelievable, unbelievable.

32
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,700
Okay, Tommy, first of all,
I wanna talk to your mom.

33
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,700
Second of all, let's talk
about self-optimization.

34
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,700
What does it mean to be productive?

35
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:28,700
Yeah, so for me to be
productive is probably to prioritize

36
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,700
and to do the stuff
that really matters to you.

37
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,700
So meaning that,

38
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,700
you know,

39
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,000
if you want a create growth
in your life,

40
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,700
if you want to achieve your,
let's say, goals, you need systems.

41
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,300
And by systems, I mean
you need mental models

42
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,700
and also technology
and digital tools

43
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,700
because it's like real
superpowers to really create

44
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:59,700
this compound interest of,
basically, self-optimization

45
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,700
or self-improvement.

46
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,700
So I really -

47
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,700
Why do we need that?

48
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,700
Because we go about our day

49
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,700
You know, we're all working.

50
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,000
We're working hard.
We're doing you know,

51
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,300
sometimes we work 12,
13 hours a day.

52
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,700
Why do we need to self-optimize
if we're getting stuff done?

53
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:21,700
So we live in a very, let's say,
hectic times when you have

54
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,700
so much information overload.

55
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,700
Some experts call it
the "attention economy."

56
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,700
So you have so many things to read,
so many things to learn,

57
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,700
so many things to,

58
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,700
you know, when you open
your email, you probably have

59
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,700
so many messages
that you need to go through.

60
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,700
But when you ask yourself,
"What really creates growth

61
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
around my life, around my"

62
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,700
you know, "what actually
makes me happy,

63
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,700
what actually makes
me a better person,

64
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,700
a smarter person?"
And probably

65
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,000
You know

66
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,700
So, think about everything
that you want to achieve in life.

67
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,700
This is not something that
you will find on Facebook

68
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,700
or you will find on Twitter.

69
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,700
This is something that
you need to work hard

70
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,700
and every day.

71
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,700
And this exactly the meaning
of compound interest.

72
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,700
Like every day

73
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,700
Like becoming 1% better every day.

74
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,700
This is something that

75
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:20,700
you can really achieve by
building your own systems.

76
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,700
And this is why I love

77
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,700
the fact that we are living
in a world that

78
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,700
you can create your own software
without knowing a line of code.

79
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,700
This is amazing.

80
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,700
This is like a great superpower
that everyone can take

81
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:39,700
and go above the noise
and become much smarter,

82
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,700
become more talented,
and more resourceful than ever

83
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,700
because they create
their own systems,

84
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,700
their own software around

85
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,700
you know your goals
and your desires, basically.

86
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,700
So, just to simplify it,
what you're saying is,

87
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,000
this notion that if we are

88
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,700
if we improve some aspect
of our lives by 1% every day,

89
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,000
that 1% is actually compounded

90
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,700
and actually,
after a hundred days,

91
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,700
we've actually improved
almost sort of 100% of ourselves.

92
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,700
And if we take the time,
and we use data,

93
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,700
and we use software
to think more critically about

94
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,700
what we do, and soon
you're going to show us some

95
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,700
of these insanely cool features,
then we're gonna be able

96
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,700
to improve with,
actually not,

97
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,700
and it's actually not that hard
to improve once you have the data.

98
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,700
And let's just start.

99
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,700
Show me what's on your

100
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,700
on your middle finger
on your left hand.

101
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,700
That's one
of the coolest things.

102
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,000
It's a beautiful ring but it's not

103
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,700
a wedding ring, right?

104
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,700
Yeah, basically, sleep

105
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,700
like I'm fascinated by ...
multipliers that we have in life.

106
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,700
And some of them are really easy.

107
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,700
This is like, you know

108
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:53,000
The fact that sleeping is so
important for so many aspects

109
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,700
of your life, and still, we are
compromising our sleep every night,

110
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,700
especially entrepreneurs,
especially founders.

111
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:05,700
I see many founders,
like you know, bragging like

112
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,700
They share with me the fact
that they are not sleeping well.

113
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,700
And they're not saying it as

114
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,700
like, to be

115
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,700
you know, as something that

116
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,700
You know, sometimes,
I'm hearing people like

117
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,300
proudly speaking -
- Right.

118
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,700
about the fact that
they are not sleeping well.

119
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,700
You know, "I'm working hard.

120
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,700
I'm not sleeping like

121
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,700
I'm sleeping 4 hours a night

122
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,700
meaning that I'm working

123
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,700
very effective
and very hard"

124
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,700
But the fact that busy
doesn't mean that you are

125
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,700
productive or effective

126
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,200
Right.

127
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,700
It's probably the opposite.

128
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,700
Like if you are not optimizing
your day, so you're probably

129
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,700
going to compromise your night.

130
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,700
And then, what will happen
in the long run

131
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:51,700
that you'll be less healthy,
less focused, less anything.

132
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:58,700
There are so many elements
that are affected

133
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,700
from our sleep,
the way we sleep at night,

134
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,700
not only the
duration of our sleep,

135
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,700
but also the quality of our sleep,
that I was amazed by the fact

136
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,700
that there are so many books
that you can read.

137
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:14,700
I think the book called
Sleep Wisely, maybe.

138
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,700
- Okay.
- I need to check it out

139
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,700
but I will send if we have
some notes on Facebook.

140
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,700
We can send some links
or the tools that

141
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,700
I'm going to share
and all the books.

142
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,700
A hundred percent.
A hundred percent. Yeah.

143
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,700
Yeah. Sleep Wise.

144
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,700
Okay. So, Sleep Wise is

145
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,700
Maybe not, maybe
it's Baby Wise.

146
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,700
Maybe I'm confused
with my Baby Sleep.

147
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,700
[laughs]

148
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,700
Okay. Yeah.
This is also important

149
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,700
but I think that

150
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,700
Everyone knows that
sleep is important

151
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,700
but not everyone are taking

152
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,000
not everyone are optimizing
their sleep and understand

153
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,700
how can it actually affect
their day because

154
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,700
you know this is our defaults
and we are living with them

155
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:59,000
and our body kind of adapts
but in a way, when I optimize

156
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,700
my sleep and this is why I bought
the ring because I wanted that

157
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,700
the first step to optimize
something is, basically,

158
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:11,700
observation and learning
the status quo.

159
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,700
Okay. Like a startup.
So the first thing that you do,

160
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,700
you're doing
like a market research.

161
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,700
You're checking
out a few competitors.

162
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,700
So, you're doing some research.

163
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,700
So, if you want to improve
your sleep, you have to learn

164
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,700
what is your current situation.

165
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,700
You have to do some analysis
work like to understand

166
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,700
and -

167
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,300
And that's impossible to do

168
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,700
when you're sleeping
because you're sleeping.

169
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,000
You're not actually aware
but this ring helps you

170
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,700
by giving you, I guess,
you know, a dashboard that says,

171
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,700
"This is how much sleep
you've gotten, this is where

172
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,000
you didn't get good sleep,
and these are your improvement

173
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,700
steps for the next day" Right?

174
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,700
Yeah, basically,
this is the web interface.

175
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,700
So, it's not very

176
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,700
it's not the best interface.

177
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,700
They have like an app that I can

178
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,700
share with the audience

179
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,700
as well, but basically,
you can see trends

180
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,700
around my sleep, not only
the duration of my sleep

181
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,700
but also some cool stuff
about cycles, like the stages

182
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,700
So, you need REM and deep sleep
in order to

183
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,700
really create a quality
sleep every night.

184
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,000
So, basically, it's around
30 percent of REM

185
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,700
and 30 percent of
deep sleep every night,

186
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,700
regardless of the duration
of the sleep, of course,

187
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,700
between seven to eight hours
is a good sleep.

188
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,700
Nine hours is not very good,
also, but you know,

189
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,700
I'm hearing a lot
of people like sleeping,

190
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,700
on average, four hours,
five hours a night.

191
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,700
And this is

192
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,700
you know, it's so

193
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,700
I don't have words
to say like how bad it is.

194
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,700
- I'm going to -
- You know, if you're

195
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,700
on your 20s,
so okay, it's fine.

196
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,700
Your body probably can adapt.

197
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,700
But you know, I'm like on my 30s

198
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,700
and I can tell you that after
I optimized my sleep,

199
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,700
like the fact that

200
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,700
It's a power multiply

201
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,000
to so many things.

202
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,700
Your productivity, to the
way you make decisions

203
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,700
to the way you actually
run your day,

204
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,700
Yeah.

205
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,300
to your happiness,
to your love,

206
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:14,900
to your

207
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,300
Everything is kind of affected
from the way you sleep.

208
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,300
It's not only duration.

209
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,000
I've heard this quite a few times
but Tommy, you're

210
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,700
I mean the things that you do
to optimize your day go

211
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,700
far beyond just the sleep.

212
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,700
So, you're

213
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,700
I mean you are literally
optimizing almost every

214
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,700
single part of your day.
So, I'd love to spend the next

215
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,700
Yeah.

216
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,700
thirteen to fifteen minutes
you know, let's go over

217
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,700
a bunch of the things that you do
to self-optimize because

218
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,700
I wanna learn myself,
and I think that anybody

219
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,700
who sees this is gona be
just fascinated to see

220
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,700
Yeah.

221
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,700
what's possible in the realm
of optimizations.

222
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,700
Sure. So, the first thing
that I learned from the book,

223
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:54,700
Atomic Habits,
is that it's not very useful

224
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:59,700
to define goals, to set up goals
and to set up

225
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,700
objectives for your life.
It's better to set up systems.

226
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,700
Right

227
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,700
So, if you want to do something,

228
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,700
if you want to become someone
Let's say, I want to lose

229
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,700
some weight, okay?

230
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,000
So, it's good to have
like an eye level goal

231
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,700
of what you want to achieve,
but it's better to have a system

232
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,700
that works every day.

233
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,000
It's much more effective,

234
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,700
and this is exactly
what I did here.

235
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:26,700
So, I created a system
called ...OS, which basically,

236
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,700
I have levels of things
that I want to improve.

237
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,000
And you can see it here.

238
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,300
So, the levels are reflection,
body, reading,

239
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:38,700
so I want to become smarter
by reading, seek truth.

240
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,700
I'm drafting stuff.
So, I love to write stuff,

241
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,700
I like to network.

242
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,300
So, I love to meet people
and I also love my family.

243
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,700
So, I want to also

244
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,700
So, every article that I'm reading
and every piece of information

245
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,700
I'm capturing in this space.
So, I have some levels of life.

246
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,300
And if you know Naval

247
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,000
So I took some inspiration
from his post,

248
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,700
his tweet storm around

249
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:05,700
that it kind of outlines all
the important stuff in life.

250
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,700
So, I just put it here and I
created some spaces around it.

251
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,700
- Wow.
- And basically,

252
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,700
Here, you can

253
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,700
inside of every pillar,
every level,

254
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,700
I have pieces of information
and inspiration that I took

255
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,700
from many people.

256
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,700
But here, on my ...OS,

257
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,700
basically, I'm managing
all my information here.

258
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,000
So, I'm managing my focus
areas like what I want to achieve.

259
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,700
This is basically my OPRs,
my personal OPRs.

260
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,000
I also have here some rewards.

261
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,300
So, for every OPR
that I'm achieving,

262
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,700
and for every goal
that I'm locking,

263
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,700
I'd get a

264
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,700
like I buy a gift for myself.

265
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,700
-Wow.

266
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,700
For example,
this one, I will buy like

267
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,700
this new magic keyboard,
this awesome magic keyboard.

268
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,000
So, this is sort of like
a reward system that

269
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I created for myself.
And this is why I love

270
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,700
Notion and other platforms that
you can see now in the world.

271
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,700
They are letting no coders,
so people that don't know how

272
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,700
to code, they're letting them
build their own systems,

273
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,700
which is great.

274
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,700
So basically here,
I can see, let's say

275
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,700
Okay, so let's open this toggle.

276
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,700
So, here I have this
habit tracker.

277
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:22,700
So, if we'll add a new day,

278
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,700
you can see my goals,

279
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,700
basically, but let's add
a new day here.

280
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,700
So I'm adding a new day.
Basically, this is today.

281
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,700
Let's say it should work.
No? Okay. So June 30.

282
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,700
Basically, I'm tracking

283
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,700
I'm tracking a lot of things
during the day.

284
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,700
Today's Wednesday.

285
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,700
Does it become

286
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,700
I mean

287
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,700
So if you do this every day,
does it ever become a burden

288
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,700
to the point where
you just don't feel like doing it

289
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,700
because it's taking

290
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,700
because you just want
to get on with your day?

291
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,700
So it should be frictionless.

292
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,700
And I got to be
honest with Notion,

293
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:04,000
because of the lack of API,
it's not 100% frictionless,

294
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,700
but it's still very easy to set up.

295
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,000
So every day, when I wake up,
today, I didn't actually do it,

296
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,700
but every day, I'm actually
tracking my goals.

297
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,700
And I'm just putting here

298
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,700
So this is yoga.
- Oh!

299
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,700
This is like
So I have like an AviTrack

300
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,700
and it affects the
actually the day.

301
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,700
So if I'm checking here yoga,
reading, working out,

302
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,700
sleeping well.

303
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,700
And then I have some brain food
that I'm tracking.

304
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,700
So, everything there is.

305
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,700
I'm not tracking food
like everything that I ate.

306
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,700
I'm just tracking things
that I want to -

307
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,700
- Okay.
- It's like a

308
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,700
It's like a white list
of food that I wanna -

309
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,700
Amazing.

310
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,000
That I want to consume every day.

311
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,700
So it's a system.

312
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,300
It's kind of

313
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,700
it becomes a system.

314
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:54,000
So you see if I'm eating six
different types of food

315
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
from this list,

316
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,300
I'm getting this emoji
of avocado here.

317
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,700
Amazing.

318
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,700
You can see it here.
So I know that I

319
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,700
let's say I achieved everything.
So let's say I achieved this one,

320
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,700
and this one, and this one.
- So cool.

321
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,700
And I did this.

322
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,000
So you can see
I'm getting the message,

323
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
"Great job, Tommy," automatically.

324
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,700
This is like I'm playing
with the formula of Notion -

325
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,700
And again, this is
all personally for you.

326
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,000
Nobody else sees this.

327
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,700
This is just
for Tommy to feel good.

328
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,700
Yeah.

329
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,700
about the progress you're making.

330
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,700
And one of the things
that Atomic Habits,

331
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,700
and I read the book recently.

332
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,700
One of the things
that he talks about, the author, is

333
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,700
this idea that, obviously,
the incremental 1% improvements

334
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:38,700
but this idea that you have to do
really small wins every day,

335
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,700
so that you keep on the momentum.

336
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,700
And by seeing these,

337
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,700
all these icons,

338
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,700
and all these emojis,
you actually have that inner

339
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,300
motivation to continue.

340
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,700
But Tommy, we only have -
- Exactly.

341
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,000
We have about six minutes
left and we have

342
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
so much to go through.

343
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,200
Yeah.

344
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,700
We have Gyro, we have Calendar,
we have so much to go through.

345
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,700
So let's -
- Sure. Just let me

346
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,700
let me show you
one more thing here

347
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,700
and then we can move
to other aspects

348
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,300
of some you know cool acts
that we can showcase.

349
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,700
But let's talk about
like morning routines.

350
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,700
So, you probably
read a lot of books around

351
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,700
morning routine,
"You should do this,

352
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,700
and this, and this."

353
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,700
So instead of kind of thinking
what is the perfect

354
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,700
morning routine,
you can create a system,

355
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:24,700
a digital system to actually
do it every day without

356
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,000
thinking about it.

357
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
So I have here

358
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,700
you can see this column,
this like sun

359
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,700
kind of sunrise emoji.

360
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,700
So when I open it,
I do several things.

361
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,700
And I built this but I

362
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,700
it's really, really easy to build.

363
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,700
So basically, I can read
an inspirational kind of a

364
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:48,700
visual image that I love
by Jack Boucher.

365
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,700
I can put here

366
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,700
I can capture
what I'm grateful for.

367
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,700
So I can kind of do

368
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,700
this gratitude kind of practice.

369
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,700
This is the status quo.

370
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,700
So every day, I will see here
a different startup quote

371
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,700
from different
persona that

372
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,700
I love.

373
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,700
Here I do meditations.

374
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,700
So basically,
I have this audio embedded

375
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,700
and I can just take

376
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,000
you know, a step back,
relax, and -

377
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,700
A whole morning routine
on one dashboard, I love it.

378
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,700
Exactly, that idea.

379
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:24,700
So let's move on to, basically,
this incremental improvement,

380
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,700
so becoming every day better.

381
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,700
So, basically, I built
a system in Notion,

382
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:34,700
which I can see
and I can reflect for,

383
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,700
probably you
know what is the meaning of

384
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:42,700
a weekly reflection
or weekly review.

385
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,700
So basically, it's just reflecting
on your week,

386
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,700
planning your next week,

387
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,000
seeing how you
can improve yourself.

388
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,700
So I built a system to do
probably the perfect

389
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,700
weekly review for me.

390
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,700
So here, what I can see

391
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,700
So for each week,
I can see the stuff

392
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,000
that I want to improve.

393
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I'm actually measuring
three main things.

394
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,700
I'm measuring my sleep score,
measuring my productivity score

395
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,700
from RescueTime.

396
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,000
I can show you
the dashboard right away,

397
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,700
and I'm measuring
my health score from Gyroscope.

398
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,700
So basically,
the health score is

399
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,700
This is Gyroscope.

400
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,700
- Oh my god.
- It takes information

401
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:25,700
from Apple Health,
my Oura ring, the Apple watch.

402
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,700
Many aspects, the weather,
so many things that, you know

403
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,700
RescueTime,
so you can see the focus,

404
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,700
you can see that

405
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:35,700
on average,
I'm 79 percent focused at work.

406
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,700
So, it kind of aggregates
a lot of information

407
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,700
and present it to you
in a dashboard that,

408
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,700
you know, you can create
correlations between

409
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,700
the different data points.

410
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:52,700
So let's say I want to know
how my resting heart rate

411
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,700
affects my sleep.

412
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,700
So I can see the details
and I can basically connect

413
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,700
You can see it here.

414
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,700
So you can you can see
my resting heart rate,

415
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,700
which is an indicator
for good health.

416
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:07,700
And I can connect,
let's say, my computer

417
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:13,700
stats to see what's going on,
if my heart rate is high,

418
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,700
on the high side,
how does it affect my focus

419
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,700
on the digital space?

420
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:25,300
You know, I can just explore
some different correlation

421
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,700
between my health and the way
it actually affects

422
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,700
my productivity.

423
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:34,700
And then you kind of
become your data analysis

424
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,700
or like data scientist
of yourself.

425
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,700
So you kind of,

426
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,700
you know,
you can think about it

427
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,700
You can think about yourself
as a product, as a startup.

428
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,000
The way you optimize
yourself is by data,

429
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,700
and reading data
and affecting on data,

430
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,000
and then optimizing
and thinking how you can

431
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,700
improve yourself every day,
every week, and so on.

432
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,700
Unbelievable. Tommy, talk to me

433
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,000
about calendars.

434
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,700
Talk to me about
what is the importance

435
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:08,700
of being a good
calendar optimizer and planner.

436
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,700
Yeah, okay. So

437
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,700
So, let's talk a bit
about the future of calendaring.

438
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,700
So what we do at Supertools

439
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:22,700
So after creating one of the most
biggest productivity communities

440
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:27,500
in the world, we've decided that we
want to tap into the productivity

441
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,700
SaaS space, and create something

442
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,900
that will be meaningful for
people. So we started to interview

443
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,000
a lot of people.

444
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And we understood that one of them,
the most obsolete, let's say,

445
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,700
tools that we have on
our digital stack is our calendar.

446
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,700
Basically, from 2006, probably,
when Google introduced

447
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:54,700
Google Calendar,
we haven't seen any innovation

448
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,700
around the most important
time system that we have.

449
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,700
Basically, it's just like,
if I can say,

450
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,700
a stupid record system.

451
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,700
You can record events,

452
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,700
but the software
doesn't make you better.

453
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,700
It doesn't work for you.
You work for your Calendar.

454
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,700
Right.

455
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,300
So one of the most impactful
and useful methodologies

456
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,700
around calendar is time blocking.

457
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,700
Basically, it's a practice
when you block time

458
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,700
on your calendar
and you take and prioritize

459
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,700
tasks that you have
and prioritize goals and put

460
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,700
put some time slots
on your calendar to work on them.

461
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,700
But it's really,

462
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,700
you know,
you have a lot of friction

463
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,700
around it because you need to take
at least an hour of your day

464
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,700
to just do this practice
and it's really hard.

465
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,000
Like honestly, it's really hard.

466
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,700
So as a productivity trainer,
I taught many people

467
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,700
how to do this practice
and to do this workflow,

468
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:59,700
but I believe a good software
can take a lot of the

469
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,700
a lot of the busy work,
a lot of the hard work.

470
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,700
And basically, what we do now,
we are creating a calendar

471
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:11,300
that can help you time block,
that can help you be more engaged

472
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,700
with what you want to achieve
and what you want to do.

473
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,700
So you can think
about it as a personal

474
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:20,700
as a personal kind of assistant
but dedicated

475
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,700
to make you a time machine.

476
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,700
Dedicated to make you a better -
- So give me one or two pointers

477
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,700
about what I should be doing
with my own calendar

478
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,000
What my friends should be doing
with their calendar to be

479
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,200
Yeah.

480
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,700
to get more control
over what we do.

481
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,700
Yeah, and I believe like

482
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,700
the calendar

483
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,700
like the user interface
of the calendar is probably

484
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:46,700
the most effective thing
that you can use during your day

485
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,700
in order to become

486
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,700
As I come tracking everything
on my calendar

487
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:56,700
I'm tracking my sleep,
I'm tracking task,

488
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,700
I'm tracking so many things,
and I'm putting everything.

489
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,700
It's like my navigation system.

490
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,700
It work and I just want
to make it better and

491
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,000
I think a lot of people
are waiting to see

492
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,700
a better version of our calendar

493
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,700
but if I can give just one tip
that you can probably implement

494
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:18,700
from tomorrow until launch
is ask yourself every day,

495
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:22,700
"What is my most important task?"
and try to book it.

496
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:27,700
It can be between 60 minutes
to 90 minutes,

497
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,700
try to book it in the first

498
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,700
Right away, after you wake up
and after your morning routine,

499
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:37,700
try to book it the first thing
in the morning before

500
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,700
you're doing meetings.
Before you're running any meeting,

501
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,700
try to book your
most important task.

502
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,700
Just time to work on it.

503
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,700
You don't have to finish the task.

504
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:53,700
You just need to be accountable
to the time, and you know, exactly

505
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:58,300
like you're accountable
to a meeting with your doctor.

506
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,700
So think you have a meeting

507
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,700
with your doctor
like you're just

508
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,300
working on your
most important task.

509
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,700
So, it really helps you

510
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:10,700
prioritize and kind of take
intentions into actions.

511
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,700
Turn intention into actions.

512
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,700
And this is why I love
time blocking because

513
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:18,700
it's so effective.
You feel the change right away.

514
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,300
And obviously,
one of the most difficult

515
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,700
challenges with this
is that you are

516
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,700
You're the only attendee
of your calendar invite.

517
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,700
So when something else
pops up or when somebody

518
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,700
needs your attention,
it's much easier to tell yourself,

519
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,700
"Oh, Michael, yeah,
I'll just get to this later."

520
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,700
Yeah.

521
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,700
So I'll give you another tip.

522
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,700
So this is what we can do
together, maybe.

523
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,700
So I am
accountability partner.

524
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,700
All right.

525
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,700
And let's say you have a task,
and I have a task,

526
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:50,700
I can send you a Zoom invite
to, let's say, 90 minutes

527
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,700
of focus time.

528
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,700
Okay? So we can be
focused together.

529
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,700
We are muting the call.

530
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,700
You work on your most important task,
I work on my most important task.

531
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:03,000
And we are catching up every
like 30 minutes to just check in

532
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,700
what's going on.

533
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,700
Accountability partner is

534
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,700
it's probably one of the most
effective things that you can do

535
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:13,700
for your product to supercharge
your productivity.

536
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,700
So, if you are working from home,

537
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,700
this can be really,
really effective.

538
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,700
And you don't need any tool.

539
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,700
You can just send -
- Exactly.

540
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,000
a calendar invite to your partner

541
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,700
and work on your most, yeah.

542
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,700
We're doing it a lot.

543
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,700
We also have a clock here.
This is really cool.

544
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:34,700
So, basically, we created
the Zoom background when

545
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,700
- I'll show you.
- Oh, that's so cool.

546
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,700
Yeah. So we have sort of
like a Pomodoro clock.

547
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,700
So every

548
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,300
So we are

549
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:46,700
We are working with intervals
It's called Pomodoro.

550
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,700
So every time,
everyone can see this clock.

551
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,700
Everyone are working
on their s**t

552
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:54,700
and by the end of the session,
we are just checking in,

553
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,700
going to take coffee,
to the restroom,

554
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,700
and continuing
with the next session.

555
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,700
So it can be really effective

556
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,700
and really, Oh sorry.

557
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,700
[laughs]

558
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,700
Yeah.

559
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,000
[laughs]
This is like a big time saver.

560
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,700
So, for long webinars,
this can be really effective.

561
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:17,700
So, if you want to go and still
be engaged with the meeting,

562
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,700
you can create your own avatar.

563
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:25,700
Tommy, show me the one
of your living room. Yeah.

564
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,700
- Wait, no, no, the -
- The living room?

565
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,700
Oh, this one.
Oh, this one, yes,

566
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:34,700
like when you have
this annoying person

567
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,700
who is getting into the frame

568
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,340
[laughs]

569
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,700
I love it. I love it.

570
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,700
Yeah basically
you could do a lot of stuff.

571
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,700
Yeah.

572
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,700
Tommy

573
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,700
This is my favorite movie.

574
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,700
It's also effective
to put the agenda

575
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,700
of the meeting here.
This one is for eBay but

576
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,700
Amazing.

577
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,300
Yeah, many cool stuff. So

578
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:58,700
Wow. Amazing, amazing, amazing.
Tommy, this is just fascinating.

579
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:03,000
And you know, it very shows
that this is something that you're

580
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
so passionate about.

581
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,700
And obviously, the things
you showed here

582
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,700
are things that you've been
working on for quite some time.

583
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:12,000
And while there may be
a lot of friction to get into them

584
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
on day one, on day two. The goal is
for them to be a frictionless

585
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,700
part of your day, and actually,
just make you that 1%

586
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,200
more productive.

587
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,700
So I'm sure that by now,
you don't feel that it's a chore

588
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,700
to go on, and you know,
continue managing them.

589
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:26,700
They're already set in place.

590
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,700
And one of the things that
I'm making a goal for myself is

591
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,700
to set some of these things
up for me because

592
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,700
I hold myself accountable
to many things.

593
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,700
I don't yet hold myself
accountable for my sleep

594
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,700
or for how productive
I am throughout the day.

595
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,700
And I definitely feel
like I'm chasing my own calendar.

596
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,700
I'm chasing the things
that I have to do

597
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,000
instead of taking
ownership over them.

598
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So thank you for the inspiration.
Before we leave, Tommy,

599
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,700
I need three words that you
would use to describe yourself.

600
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:55,700
Well, building time machines,
probably

601
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:00,700
Yeah, it's like the perfect way
to describe what I'm doing

602
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,700
and what is my long-term vision
40 years from now.

603
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,700
So I'll always build
like time machines

604
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,700
and make them more accessible
and want to democratize

605
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,700
productivity to the rest
of the world.

606
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,700
I love it. Tommy, toda raba.
Thank you very, very much.

607
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,700
And I can't wait to -
- It was fun

608
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,700
Can't wait to catch up
properly in Israel.

609
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:24,700
Me, too, man. Bye-bye.
