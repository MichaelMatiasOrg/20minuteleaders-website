1
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,880
Zoe, thank you so much for being
on my show 20 minute leaders

2
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,000
I cannot believe I have you on this show

3
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,840
this is amazing

4
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,520
thank you for having me

5
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,840
that's great

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,040
so, disclaimer

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,440
your son is one of my best friends
and a huge inspiration for me

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,040
all the way back from high school,
we met on the Playa at Burning Man

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,520
I believe it was 2014 when he
graciously invited my father

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,920
and I go to your wonderful camp, which has
evolved so beautifully over the years

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,440
we joined you at three time radio

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,240
and head life changing
experiences at Burning Man

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,400
but while you're a burner and you're all

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,640
competing in the world,
in the global scavenger hunt,

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,080
actually competing your winning
the global scavenger hunt

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,360
more so competing

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,280
a you're actually a pretty incredible

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,360
litigator and you're fighting
for some really important causes

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,480
Zoe, who are you?

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,680
once and for all, clear this
up for me, who are you?

21
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,920
I think I'm a person like
most people that are

22
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,960
working hard in their
profession is I'm a lot of things

23
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,240
you know, I'm a mom
I'm definitely a burner

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,680
I definitely am addicted to adventure travel

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,280
and I had the great fortune of choosing
a career that I love and that has always

26
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:43,120
brought me great joy and
frustrations and successes and failures

27
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,160
but I think if you start off on a track
that you know you love,

28
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,280
you're never going to
be bored or disappointed

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,920
wonderful, you know, I mean,

30
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,120
the Jewish Mom tradition that we know
is that, yeah you can be a Doctor or a lawyer

31
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,240
regardless if you could or not

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,440
but you're a lawyer that you'll love,
you're doing

33
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,520
you're litigating
why do you love it so much

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,000
what is it about
it excites you?

35
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,960
when I was a little girl,

36
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,960
I knew that I had an inherent talent, that
I was not afraid of speaking in public

37
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,240
and most people are terrified
of speaking in public

38
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,280
so it's sort of like a superpower
the number one fear in the world

39
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,680
yes, it's a superpower if
you're not afraid of it

40
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,120
and I realize I like speaking in public

41
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,720
and I wasn't afraid of it

42
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,600
and there was only a few professions
that pay you to speak in public

43
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,920
politician, lawyer

44
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,400
and so very young

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,080
I realized I wanted to litigate because
that was a way to get paid,

46
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,040
to do what I liked and what I
had an inherent talent for for

47
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,960
well, you could have also gone to L.A
and Hollywood and go on Broadway

48
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,560
but you chose to be in the courtroom

49
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,840
but the courtroom is
theater in its own way.

50
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,800
if you are not entertaining and persuading
and keeping the jurors attention

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,080
you're not winning
I love it

52
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,320
ok, so so litigator, lawyer

53
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,640
and what type of lawyer are you?

54
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,080
because you get to deal
with some really crazy cases

55
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,280
It's not just this, you know, these
ordinary cases that we hear about on TV

56
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,840
I have been lucky in that I never had

57
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,880
to do sort of entry level legal work
of car accidents and slip and falls

58
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,640
I got into a practice early on that did
big cases and then I formed my own firm

59
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,800
and I've always had my choice of cases

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
so I got to choose
the people I represented

61
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,800
I've always represented people injured

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,640
by the negligent or gross negligent
conduct of corporations and other people

63
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,560
and I have had great the honor of speaking

64
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,280
for people whose lives have been destroyed
by the negligence of others

65
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,600
and that is as a true honor

66
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,000
you know that that's insane because
it's not just about somebody life's

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,680
being ... and then going for them
and speaking out about it

68
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,480
but you're actually tackling
some huge corporation,

69
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,320
hundreds of billions of dollars or
a hundred million dollars who have,

70
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,640
you know, in comparison to the resources
that the individual has

71
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,080
It's uncomfortable and here

72
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,720
you come saying well, we're the underdogs,
I'm going to represent you and we are going to be

73
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,280
better than than the dozen
lawyers that they're putting up

74
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,120
but how fun is that is to choose

75
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,800
a profession where the people you're
against are the best money can buy

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,960
I go against the most powerful and

77
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,000
well-funded corporations,
and they can afford the best lawyers

78
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,640
which means you're always going against

79
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,240
people who make you up your game
and be the top of your game

80
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,960
yeah, so I'm I'm not sure you can disclose this

81
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,760
but is there like one case of one example

82
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,160
of a case that has been public disclosure
that you can just mention what type

83
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,160
of just to give a context of what types
of cases the art you're tackling

84
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,400
yeah
so for a long time,

85
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,720
I represented women who had developed
breast cancer from taking a defective

86
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,360
drug, a hormone therapy
drug and menopause

87
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
and there were women who should
never have had breast cancer

88
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,680
their family had should never
have gone through that experience

89
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,880
some of them had died from the breast cancer

90
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,320
and it was really rewarding

91
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,120
they were older women who had been very

92
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,120
trusting of the drug industry,
really trusting that the pharmaceuticals

93
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,120
they were taking were really just going
to be beneficial and not hurt them

94
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,240
and then they got this terrible diagnosis

95
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,520
and went through years
of treatment and fear

96
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,040
and so representing them and getting

97
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,000
justice for them and their
family was incredible

98
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,600
and it was against both Wyeth and Pfizer,
two of the largest companies in the world

99
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,120
unbelievable
unbelievable

100
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,800
so so paint me a picture as you're standing

101
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,120
there in the courtroom and you have a
and you have a jury and and you're talking

102
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,560
about, you know, these
are emotional subjects

103
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,200
people's lives are being ruined

104
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,480
how do you even go about approaching
a case like this when you're saying, like,

105
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,560
wow, I have to deal
with with Pfizer and why it's

106
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,840
I think you have to come from a place
of gratitude that your client has has

107
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,160
gifted you this opportunity
to speak for them

108
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,960
my clients either are dead or sick

109
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,320
they can't understand the concepts

110
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,600
of a courtroom and they need
someone to advocate for them

111
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,680
so being a litigator is truly
an honor of being an advocate

112
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,760
you get to tell their story

113
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,320
you get to show the jury what they went

114
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,800
through with the decisions that were made
at the corporate level that

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,400
were decisions that ended up really
hurting this family and this person

116
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,200
and once you come from that part,

117
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:39,480
then you speak with authentic passion,
because I truly believe in the

118
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,240
In the veracity of my client's case,
I believe in what they're trying to do

119
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,800
and then I speak from my heart

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,120
and once you are passionately trying

121
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,920
to get that message across,
the juries will listen

122
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,040
Zoe, that's beautiful
and I have to say that while you're

123
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,440
explaining I, I, I don't know that side of you
 in court because I know the

124
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,040
At Burning Man and, you know,

125
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,080
going to going and eating dinner together
out outside of burning

126
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,240
but, you know, the side that I also see

127
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,120
is that you're bringing this heart
and passion for your personal life

128
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,520
I mean, I'm meeting these people that are
joining our camp at Burning Man whose lives

129
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,960
you've literally transformed

130
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,600
and they have so much gratitude
for what you've given them

131
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,800
and I know you're too humble to come
and say, yeah, I did that

132
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,880
but but it but it's true

133
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,520
and I speak also personally

134
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,880
and there's like Zoe
did this for me

135
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,640
It's The Burning Man

136
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,000
but my whole life and I think just
it's remarkable and it just shines

137
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,640
and you've been an inspiration for me over

138
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,920
these past six years that I've had that
I've had the privilege of knowing you

139
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,320
but you're also so adventurous
out of the courtroom

140
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,400
talk to me a little bit about this,
this burner within you

141
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,040
what is it about burning
now that attracted you so much?

142
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,840
I think if you haven't been to Burning Man,
then it's hard to put it into words

143
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,880
but there is a impossible yeah,
there is a core to Burning Man,

144
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,560
which is a belief that together we can be
better, that if we have each other's back,

145
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,800
if we go into the desert with no water
and electricity and you can't buy or sell

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,920
anything, you have to rely on each other
to survive and to have fun

147
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,480
and it's hard fun, you know, your hot

148
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,640
you don't have air conditioning hard fun
it's hard fun

149
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,360
but if you can do that,

150
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,920
if you can really embrace the the
sense of community and to be together,

151
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,760
we are better
then Burning Man is a transformational

152
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,000
experience as you feel
the Zen of that community

153
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,160
definitely
definitely

154
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,280
and so just to paint a picture

155
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,120
of the Burning Man project is
a seven or eight days where we go

156
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,520
into the desert to fly a black rock city
about three hours into the Nevada desert

157
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,800
and we form a community of about 70 or 80

158
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,080
thousand individuals that are becoming
a family and sort of like a total

159
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,600
in mindset and, you know,
one of the things that I also spoke about

160
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,640
this with my father extensively the first
time we came you,

161
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,960
you ride your bike down down the street
that you create and there's not a single

162
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,520
piece of trash on the hole
and you just think to your self

163
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,000
wow

164
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,240
there's so much junk
that everybody is bringing in

165
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,520
and and, you know, the fight that you
have to take everything out with you

166
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,760
and because of this social responsibility,

167
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,880
we community, we keep it clean
and we keep the same values

168
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,200
I think that's just incredible

169
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,200
and the world can learn so
much from this project

170
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,440
I agree
and, you know, what we learn is that if we

171
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,840
have to rely on each other,
we all have to uphold that societal bond

172
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,640
we have to take care of ourselves

173
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,040
we have to take care of our own trash

174
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,440
we can't leave other people
to pick up our leftovers

175
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,920
you know, we have to work together

176
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,520
and that is the sense

177
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,120
that's the essence of Burning Man
definitely

178
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,760
definitely
ok

179
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,640
and so we're going to leave time and talk

180
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,520
about the Athena project that
that you just started

181
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,000
but before that,

182
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,240
you are competing in one of the world's
craziest adventures,

183
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,400
the global scavenger hunt, which is
the number one on my bucket list to do

184
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,720
and you're not you're not only
competing, you're winning it

185
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,280
It's almost every time
that you participate

186
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,080
tell me about this global scavenger hunt,
everything

187
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,120
and you go around the world
and do these crazy experiences

188
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,080
it's a wonderful nonprofit
that raises money for charity

189
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,520
and it's put on by an inspired couple
who really believe that the way for people

190
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,320
to appreciate being global citizens
is to see the world in a new way

191
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,000
and so it's a blind date with the world

192
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,280
you don't know where you're going

193
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,880
you don't know how long
you're going to spend there

194
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,040
you don't know what you're gonna
have to do when you get there

195
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,000
and you basically blindly
take this date with the world

196
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,560
you show up in some
place on the West Coast

197
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,160
and for the next twenty three days,

198
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,760
you're going to go west around the world,
circumnavigate the world

199
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,880
you're going to stop in 11,
12, 13 countries each time you land

200
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,320
wow

201
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,840
and I know you don't know which ones
you get one small suitcase

202
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,600
so you have to sort of pack layers because

203
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,400
you don't know if you're
going cold or hot

204
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,120
and when you land in each country,
the producer of the event gives you

205
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:07,760
a booklet of challenges, scavenges,
puzzles, things you have to discover,

206
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,520
decipher, clues you have to use

207
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,400
you cannot use any electronics,

208
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,560
which is so scary because we're
used to Googling everything

209
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,440
you cannot use any electronics
yes,

210
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,440
you cannot use any electronic maps

211
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,520
you have to walk out of the hotel and just
stop people and start interacting

212
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,120
in whatever country you are using
charades because you don't speak

213
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,800
the language and have locals
from that country help you

214
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,520
decipher these scavenges and point you
in the right direction and get you

215
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,720
to the places you need to go
to make the points and in each country

216
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,800
the person who does the most makes
the most points and wins that leg

217
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,480
and then if you win enough legs,

218
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,960
then you become first,
second or third in the competition

219
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,880
but it's all one of the flaws, of course.
of course, no

220
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,320
but so effectively, it's like
the amazing race without cameras

221
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,920
more authentic
and for a good cause for charity

222
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,280
and it's designed to try and make you
look at things from different group's perspective

223
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,720
so for one example,

224
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,240
we were in Cairo and obviously if you're
in Cairo, you want to go to the Sphinx

225
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,000
but we had to first go to the grand souk
and buy traditional African headgear

226
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,000
then we had to go to a camel
stable and rent camels

227
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,920
we had to put on the African headgear,
get on the camels ride over the dunes

228
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,520
and we approached the Sphinx from the
dunes on camels in African headgear

229
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,920
so you see that experience of approaching
the Sphinx is from a different

230
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,880
from a different way, a more authentic,
interesting way

231
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,880
and that's what he wants you to do

232
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,960
get out of your tourist mode,
up where we're going to eat next

233
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,600
what tourist attraction we're going to go

234
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,760
take pictures at and do something
different when we went to China

235
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,040
you had to run a mile
on the Great Wall of China

236
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,680
like you didn't just get to
go off and take your picture

237
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,320
you had to do something

238
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,960
when we went to Tiananmen Square,
you had to approach a family and get them

239
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,040
to agree to fly a kite with one of their
kids and take a picture of you and the kid

240
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,680
flying a kite in Tiananmen Square,
which means you had to interact

241
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:11,880
with people and talk to them and explain
what you were doing and ask questions and

242
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,480
feel like you were really appreciating
the country in a different way

243
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,680
so it sounds so incredible
ok

244
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,320
so at FEMA,
that FEMA joint project

245
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:30,640
to empower women litigators, the video
is so amazing and it's so inspiring

246
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,320
but tell me a little bit about what how

247
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,800
did this come about,
especially in times of Covid-19?

248
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,920
well, pandemic we're all shut in

249
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,200
and we just had this brainstorm of we

250
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,480
there are very few women
run law firms still

251
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,760
I know that's incredible,
but it still is true

252
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,480
and six very powerful women who all run

253
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,320
their own law firms who are really
well-respected in the in the field

254
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,200
decided, why don't we start pooling
our reputation and everything that we have

255
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,080
put together over the decades
and help other women litigators

256
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,920
so women who leave a law firm to start

257
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,480
their own shop and they
can't get a credit line

258
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,840
could we provide funding women who think
when they show up at mediation,

259
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,240
they don't have the reputation to really
get full value for their cases?

260
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,240
can we put our name behind them?

261
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,120
can we help those people brainstorm?

262
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,560
can we help those people
redo their trial strategies?

263
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:34,440
and one of the things we found is when
men-run, firms came to us for help getting

264
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,360
their trials together,
redoing their case strategies

265
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,840
one of the requirements was you had
to have a woman on your trial team

266
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,000
or we wouldn't help

267
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,160
so, you know, I love it, just to try to push more firms

268
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,000
to think always can we have a diverse
trial team? can we make sure there's

269
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:53,680
at least one woman on every trial team
to put more women in the courtroom?

270
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,720
I love it
I love it

271
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,640
so tangibly, how did this work as the six

272
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,400
of you, you're running your own firms
you're extremely busy with your own cases

273
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,920
so are you sort of like a board?

274
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,600
you have applicants come in and you form

275
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,200
relationships and you back them both with
perhaps funding, but mainly reputation

276
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,000
is that how it works?

277
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,880
yes, or we can work with them if they're
if they've got a case that they feel is

278
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,040
a little bit too big for them, we can
come in and help them try the case

279
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,600
we can work with them

280
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,160
we can share the funding on the case

281
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,040
we can share the fee on the case

282
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,360
we the purpose is to really
give women options

283
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:35,200
that is not really available right now
of having support, money, reputation,

284
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,800
experience,
and to just kind of do plus honestly

285
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,640
we just love working together and it's

286
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,040
a great opportunity for us
to work cooperatively

287
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,560
me and these other five women that I love

288
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,240
and who are so talented,
I learn every conversation we have

289
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,960
I learn so much about how they look
at a case or how they work on the case or

290
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,720
different ideas of how to really
make something more persuasive

291
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,120
so it's just been great fun

292
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,840
but I think we're also have
an opportunity to do some real good

293
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,320
I love it, you know,
so Zoe we just have a few minutes left

294
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,360
but I'd love to I'd love to pick your
brain as someone you're dedicating your

295
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:17,760
life to the community and people and to thinking
of who has wronged who

296
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,600
and how can we correct
this this wrongdoing?

297
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,200
and I'd let go

298
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:28,160
maybe 30,000 feet in the air and sort
of look at our society and hear a little

299
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:33,720
bit about, about what you think we do
as as global citizens to improve our

300
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,480
society and to boost the number
of of these things that are happening

301
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,640
it sounds very cliche, but I wonder

302
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,320
but I really am interested in
concerned about this

303
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,080
I think the most important thing is

304
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,480
that we have to accept
that we are global citizens

305
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,080
we are not Americans

306
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,440
we are not Texans

307
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,680
we are not Californians

308
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,120
we are global citizens in this world

309
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,360
everybody is connected

310
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,640
and maybe it's because I'm an immigrant

311
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,560
but I think it's really special when you

312
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,520
start to see your place in the world as
not just a person, but a global community

313
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,840
and that requires us putting down some
of our nationalism and populism and really

314
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,400
working together to make
the planet a better place

315
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,200
from global warming to climate
change to trade deals

316
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,000
we have got to work together

317
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,200
the inequality, the income
inequality is is startling

318
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,480
we have got to make the whole
world a more

319
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,840
equitable place, both in terms of the
planet and just what we do every day

320
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,320
and that starts with us thinking

321
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,600
of ourselves as a part of a very big
picture, which is this whole planet

322
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
oh, definitely
but

323
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,320
but you know
so it sounds like

324
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,000
so this is sort of a bottom up approach saying we

325
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,600
need to rethink our values and to intend
that we are we are global citizens

326
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,680
but at the end, a lot of it is also top

327
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,760
down where you know, where most
of us are following along

328
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,440
the different politicians up there or
the different leaders that that are

329
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,640
dictating sort of how we should
behave and how we should think

330
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,360
well, how tangibly can we be

331
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,000
can we can we tackle this?

332
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,920
and how do we expect, you know,
300 million people to think for themselves

333
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,160
and not just take for granted what what
the leaders are necessarily saying?

334
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,760
I think we have to come from a place
of much more kindness and loving

335
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,920
appreciation than we do right now

336
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,640
the divisiveness has got to stop

337
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,120
It's got to be it's we've got
to stop being different tribes

338
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,880
I mean, this country is
tribal and really we're all global

339
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,120
and we've got to get back there,
we've got to stop the divisiveness

340
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,240
we've got to appreciate each other,
love each other, be kind to each other

341
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,160
and particularly now
take care of each other

342
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,840
oh yeah

343
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,080
do the right thing so that everybody,

344
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,120
even the vulnerable and especially
the old are protected

345
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,320
and we've got to start rethinking

346
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,680
that and put down these
tribalism and this divisiveness

347
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,600
one hundred percent

348
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,360
now, you know, I took a course
at Stanford this year called

349
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,600
the Spirit of Democracy
with the world expert Larry Diamond

350
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,120
and one the things he's talking about,
his deterioration,

351
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,320
the deterioration of democracy
not just in the US, but around the world

352
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,960
and part of it is that we we forget

353
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,720
to look up and to to consider what's
actually happening around and get out

354
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,640
of the small bubble of that that we're
being fitted in sometimes wrongfully

355
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,920
and I think that's I definitely agree

356
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,080
kindness, empathy

357
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,440
I think this scavenger hunt

358
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,040
this sort of ability to go and meet these
different colors and flying a kite

359
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,880
in Tiananmen Square instead of going
and taking a picture as a tourist

360
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,240
that's that's definitely, I think
the right path

361
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,120
Zoe,

362
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,920
before we go, I ask you the hardest
question and I'm putting you a little bit

363
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:57,320
on the spot here, but I'd love for you to
tell me three words that best describe you

364
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,800
I would probably say passionate,

365
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,560
because I feel very strongly about my
my career and what I do for a living

366
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,280
I would say generous,
because I think it's very important

367
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,600
that people who have had gifts and had
opportunities be generous to others

368
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,920
don't pull the ladder up behind you,
but help other people up that ladder

369
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,560
I love that metaphor

370
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,080
And I would say spirited

371
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,040
because I'm a force to be reckoned

372
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,120
with when I put my mind
to something 100 percent

373
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,720
and I

374
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,360
I can definitely attest to that

375
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,480
Zoe, thank you so for the time

376
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,800
thank you for the inspiration
with everything that you're doing

377
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,720
it's really wonderful

378
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,400
and please send it send my regards
to your wonderful, wonderful son

379
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,480
thank you
and good luck to you, love

380
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,040
thank you
