1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,000
We thought that we understood

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,120
when we started this journey that,

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,360
okay, cars are very expensive,

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,880
let's design a cheaper car, you know.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,680
There are many, many other challenges

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,720
in racing and we learn them mainly

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,500
by operating a racing series.

8
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,120
Tamir Plachinsky, thank you

9
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,720
for joining me on to the leaders.

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,880
Good afternoon to both of us.

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,760
Thank you.

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,200
Happy to be here.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,040
Okay. Before we start,

14
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,014
I need you to tell me

15
00:00:52,015 --> 00:00:53,080
about this background.

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,920
What am I seeing here?

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,360
Yeah. It's cool ah.

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,100
What you see is the different

19
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:02,120
user interfaces of our data platform,

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,845
which we call ramp.

21
00:01:03,846 --> 00:01:05,080
A data platform

22
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,560
developed for motorsports.

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,700
This is what Griiip is now involved in

24
00:01:09,701 --> 00:01:15,920
focusing in the different screens.

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,570
So, in order for me to even begin

26
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:18,816
to try and understand

27
00:01:18,817 --> 00:01:20,120
what I'm seeing here,

28
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,320
like I mentioned before we started,

29
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,400
I don't know the difference between

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,000
the Toyota and the KIA and Hyundai.

31
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,947
To me, they're all bare metals

32
00:01:26,948 --> 00:01:27,920
on four wheels

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,480
that get me from point A to point B,

34
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,280
but I really appreciate people

35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,320
that have a passion for it.

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,600
So, Tamir,

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,800
tell me, before we start talking about

38
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,280
racing cars, how do you get started

39
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,680
with an industry like this?

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,400
What type of upbringing do you have

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,480
where you get so passionate

42
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,320
about race cars?

43
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:44,720
Yeah.

44
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,520
So, the key word here is

45
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,840
exactly what you said.

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,530
It's passion.

47
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:51,480
And you cannot

48
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,960
describe or explain passion.

49
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,640
Either you have it or either you don't.

50
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,680
And a lot of people in the world

51
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,720
apparently have this kind of passion for

52
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,840
cars, for driving, for driving fast,

53
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,040
for the adrenaline, for the excitement,

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,200
racing, motorsport, all those things,

55
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,000
which exist in motorsport.

56
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:14,759
Motorsport is like

57
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,960
the sport for those who love

58
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,600
driving and cars and everything.

59
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,714
And I think for me personally,

60
00:02:23,715 --> 00:02:25,220
it's something that I have

61
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:27,125
since I can remember

62
00:02:27,126 --> 00:02:29,600
since I was a little boy.

63
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,320
And growing up in Israel,

64
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,590
being passionate about motorsport

65
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:37,188
is not a very nice thing to do

66
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:39,520
because in the Israel,

67
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,270
there is no motorsport.

68
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:42,640
That was I was about to ask.

69
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:42,920
Right.

70
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,960
I don't see, you know,

71
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,818
I just came back from Dubai.

72
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:47,500
Every second street I go

73
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,040
there's a line up

74
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,320
of Ferraris and Lamborghinis.

75
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,439
I don't remember seeing

76
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,920
even a single Lamborghini here in Israel.

77
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,667
Yeah. Those exotic sports cars

78
00:02:56,668 --> 00:02:58,880
are one thing, but you don't have any

79
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,280
motorsport culture in Israel.

80
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,184
It's like you don't have race or

81
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:04,000
race car manufacturers or industry

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,440
or anything like that.

83
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,097
That actually, it was illegal

84
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:08,800
until around 2015.

85
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,227
So, in Israel,

86
00:03:10,228 --> 00:03:12,760
you only see that in the news

87
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,480
and in newspapers and TV,

88
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,560
but you don't really get to be

89
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,000
involved in such an activity.

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,992
And that's something

91
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,680
I've always wanted to do.

92
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,480
So growing up, I had the dream

93
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,760
to become a world champion.

94
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,720
That was my dream, driving something

95
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,120
motorcycle, race car or whatever.

96
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,200
But you come to the understanding

97
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,840
that when you're 21, after,

98
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,560
you know, serving in the military,

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,640
it's a bit late to start your career.

100
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,920
So I went to study mechanical engineering

101
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,240
in the university with the dream to get

102
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,360
to become involved in the industry.

103
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,933
I described it to myself back then

104
00:03:56,934 --> 00:03:57,800
as being involved in the

105
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,440
automotive industry.

106
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,440
And I wanted to go to Italy.

107
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,398
That was like a country I saw

108
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:06,720
as the best place to go and do that.

109
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,920
Ferrari or Lamborghini,

110
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,160
I didn't really care.

111
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,880
And then it became reality when

112
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,720
during my studies I started

113
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,000
the formula student team.

114
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,407
It's like a team of students

115
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:21,783
developing race cars

116
00:04:21,784 --> 00:04:23,640
for a student competition.

117
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,000
You race against other universities.

118
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,920
Wow.

119
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,360
I started the first team in Israel

120
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,524
back in 2010.

121
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:34,060
And then we went to an event in Italy

122
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:34,734
with the team.

123
00:04:34,735 --> 00:04:36,583
It was totally underground project.

124
00:04:36,584 --> 00:04:37,760
No one in the university

125
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,320
really knew knew what we were doing.

126
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,309
We tested the car

127
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,440
in an abandoned parking lots at night.

128
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,156
It was really one day will do

129
00:04:47,157 --> 00:04:50,360
and we will make a movie on that here.

130
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,720
And then going to Italy for the event

131
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,520
I met the main sponsor

132
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,207
of the competition

133
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,520
was a race car company from Italy

134
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,400
and they offered me a job.

135
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,680
So, I fulfilled my dream

136
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,840
and I went to work

137
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,000
in motorsport and race car manufacturer.

138
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,720
The best one in the world,

139
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,158
called Dallara.

140
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:16,920
Spent six months

141
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,760
living the dream completely,

142
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,560
as you can imagine.

143
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,120
And then coming back to Israel,

144
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,880
i was so hyped about, okay,

145
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,720
I know what I want to do.

146
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,960
I love racing. I love race car.

147
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,360
Let's do something in Israel

148
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,560
in motorsport.

149
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,668
And I saw only advantages

150
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:36,440
in the fact that there is no industry

151
00:05:36,441 --> 00:05:38,200
in Israel in motorsport.

152
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,291
You can only,

153
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:41,640
if you have no constraints,

154
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,960
you can do whatever you want.

155
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,142
100%. Right.

156
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,520
Tamir, before we continue,

157
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,937
I have to get a little bit

158
00:05:47,938 --> 00:05:49,680
of a better understanding about

159
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,633
motorsports as an industry

160
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:52,806
even before we get to

161
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:54,760
to what you're doing with Griiip.

162
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,800
Because to an outsider,

163
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,211
all I can think about is that

164
00:05:59,212 --> 00:05:59,768
in some places

165
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:01,080
there was a race cars.

166
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,120
There's these crazy people

167
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:04,252
that get into these crazy fast cars

168
00:06:04,253 --> 00:06:06,480
that are driving around in circles

169
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,520
to beat the fastest time.

170
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,280
What is this industry all about?

171
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,360
What is the excitement?

172
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,800
Give me some numbers.

173
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,593
Who is the audience?

174
00:06:14,594 --> 00:06:16,640
What does it take to get there?

175
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,360
I really am curious about this.

176
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,320
Yeah. That's a good question.

177
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:24,960
So, motor sport is probably,

178
00:06:24,961 --> 00:06:28,186
I think I won't offend anyone by saying

179
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,455
that it's the most complex sport

180
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,360
in the world.

181
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,880
You don't only have the athlete,

182
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,680
you have also the machine.

183
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,680
And it's about the man machine

184
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,600
integration that eventually win this.

185
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,137
And it's harder to understand

186
00:06:42,138 --> 00:06:43,960
as a viewer, as a fan.

187
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,240
Because it's not like you have a ball.

188
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,040
You need to throw it,

189
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,880
you have a score.

190
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,960
This is a, it's more complex.

191
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,698
You need to understand

192
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,800
why this driver is faster than the other.

193
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,187
There are a lot, a lot of things

194
00:06:56,188 --> 00:06:58,139
that you don't catch

195
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,480
with the untrained eye.

196
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,400
And also you have, let's say in a race,

197
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,760
10, 20, 50 cars,

198
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,760
it doesn't matter the number,

199
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,135
but as the number of cars

200
00:07:09,136 --> 00:07:11,590
are the number of potential events

201
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:13,909
happening every second.

202
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,528
On a football game or basketball,

203
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:17,920
you have one ball.

204
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,840
All the eyes are looking at that ball.

205
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,360
And what happened with the ball

206
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,933
is the event going on.

207
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:25,600
In a race, you have a lot of cars.

208
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
Everyone can do something.

209
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,360
So, you have many balls.

210
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,320
So, it's much difficult to understand.

211
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,636
But still watching cars

212
00:07:34,637 --> 00:07:36,400
going fast on a track,

213
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,360
it's a very exciting thing.

214
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,324
That the battle, you know that

215
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:42,344
it's the risk factor back then

216
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:45,760
when it started and make the sport much,

217
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,840
very much like gave

218
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,663
the interesting factor to it.

219
00:07:49,664 --> 00:07:52,280
You know they are risking their lives.

220
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,880
And unfortunately,

221
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,878
we can still see drivers

222
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,999
getting hurt on the track,

223
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,920
even though safety became

224
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,520
much, much better than it was used to be.

225
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,120
But the combination of speed and risk

226
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,310
and sound and everything

227
00:08:09,311 --> 00:08:11,880
is like a spectacular,

228
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,160
like no other sport, at least in my mind.

229
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,680
But being that complex

230
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,120
with the facilities and the cars or

231
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,160
motorcycles and everything,

232
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,720
it's a very expensive sport.

233
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,107
And that's like a big, big

234
00:08:27,108 --> 00:08:29,000
negative thing for the industry

235
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,162
because you always want to have

236
00:08:31,163 --> 00:08:32,182
as many drivers

237
00:08:32,183 --> 00:08:34,040
and as many people participating.

238
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,800
But there is the money barrier in motorsport

239
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,640
that you need to have a lot of money.

240
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,800
Money plays

241
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:43,280
a very big role in motorsports.

242
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,480
Right?

243
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,730
You actually surprised me

244
00:08:44,731 --> 00:08:46,318
when I talked about the,

245
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:47,880
the human machine integration

246
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,400
that that is a key to success.

247
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,240
And I always imagined that, you know,

248
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,040
yeah, you have the top players,

249
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,000
the top athletes.

250
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,280
I didn't even think of them as athletes.

251
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,259
I thought of them, okay,

252
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,148
they're really great

253
00:08:57,149 --> 00:08:59,400
hand eye coordination, and then

254
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,000
whoever gets the best car wins.

255
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,640
But what you're saying

256
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,880
is that it actually

257
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,320
it's the combination of the car specs

258
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,800
and the driver's specific skill sets

259
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,960
that if they're aligned, that's what

260
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,000
is causing the special circumstance.

261
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,520
Right?

262
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,883
It's not just that if the car is better

263
00:09:15,884 --> 00:09:17,640
then that's it, they win.

264
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah.

265
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,720
Yeah.

266
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,213
If you look at the different

267
00:09:20,214 --> 00:09:21,920
racing series in the world,

268
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,880
that balance varies from, let's say,

269
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,385
Formula One,

270
00:09:26,386 --> 00:09:28,960
there are different manufacturers.

271
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,440
And we look at Formula One as a series

272
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,960
where the car has more

273
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,840
effect on the final result result.

274
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,120
If you look at lower

275
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,000
tier series, let's say

276
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,360
even what we call single maker series

277
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,120
where all the cars are identical,

278
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,720
but you can still

279
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,640
do different setups for the car.

280
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:57,360
So that's where the drivers talent comes.

281
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,400
That makes a lot of sense.

282
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,160
So, I'm looking at a dashboard.

283
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,060
And I have no idea

284
00:10:01,061 --> 00:10:03,315
why we would need a dashboard

285
00:10:03,316 --> 00:10:04,740
for motor racing industry.

286
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:06,000
Tell me about this.

287
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,560
Of course, I'm teasing when I say that I,

288
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,224
that there are lot of the things

289
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:10,660
that I don't understand.

290
00:10:10,661 --> 00:10:12,000
But it's too complicated

291
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,760
for me to understand,

292
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,160
but I wish I understood it better.

293
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,760
So,

294
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,860
I think, by the way, this dashboard

295
00:10:18,861 --> 00:10:19,861
as like a mirror.

296
00:10:19,862 --> 00:10:21,252
Because I think,

297
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:24,120
I see the English they're brights up.

298
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,476
I think I'm seeing it okay.

299
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah.

300
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,160
So it's like, uh, I'm sitting behind it.

301
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,640
I know it's something in the front.

302
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,546
I will explain the dashboard

303
00:10:34,547 --> 00:10:36,850
by continuing like this short history

304
00:10:36,851 --> 00:10:38,740
about Griiip.

305
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,920
So, Griiip,

306
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,640
when I came back to Israel,

307
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,160
I started Griiip as a brand

308
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,680
to make motor sport more accessible.

309
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,480
I just finished my last

310
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,947
explanation saying that

311
00:10:51,948 --> 00:10:53,315
it's very expensive.

312
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:54,820
And that's where we saw

313
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,080
Griiip comes in the market

314
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,240
offering something different.

315
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,200
Like we wanted to give more people

316
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,040
opportunity to participate.

317
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,920
And we started maybe not in the most

318
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,200
common place to start,

319
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,335
but we started with the driver.

320
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:08,873
And we said, okay,

321
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:10,726
let's give the driver

322
00:11:10,727 --> 00:11:13,680
a better solution to race,

323
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,840
a more cost effective solution.

324
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,240
So we started by designing a race car.

325
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,720
It's not a very simple thing to do

326
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,440
for a small startup.

327
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,591
Small startup from a country

328
00:11:21,592 --> 00:11:23,600
with no motor sport, with no racetracks,

329
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,960
with no knowledge.

330
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,400
It was pretty intense.

331
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,195
But, you know,

332
00:11:30,196 --> 00:11:31,465
you set up to do something

333
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:32,880
and you are very determined,

334
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,240
so, that's what you do.

335
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,886
And we eventually,

336
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,080
we designed the race car.

337
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,640
Started the racing series in Italy.

338
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,320
That's the series you see

339
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,160
in the picture.

340
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,200
And that's like on board

341
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,520
from that series.

342
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,997
That was a single maker series

343
00:11:49,998 --> 00:11:51,760
only for our cars.

344
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,200
The car, by the way,

345
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,200
we call it the model name is G1

346
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,200
and the series was the G1 series.

347
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,240
It ran for two years.

348
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,480
And during those two years

349
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,400
we learned a lot about motorsport.

350
00:12:04,401 --> 00:12:06,280
We thought that we understood

351
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,440
when we started this journey that

352
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,680
okay, cars are very expensive.

353
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,200
Let's design a cheaper car, you know.

354
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,960
There are many, many other challenges

355
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,000
in racing and we learn them mainly

356
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,160
by operating a racing series.

357
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,160
And we couldn't know that

358
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,520
before we started  this racing series.

359
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,040
You can imagine

360
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,834
an Israeli manufacturer of racing cars

361
00:12:28,835 --> 00:12:31,040
runs a series in North Italy.

362
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,914
it's not the most common thing

363
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:35,160
you'll hear.

364
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,400
By the way, how does this work?

365
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,440
So you designed the cars,

366
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,920
you manufacture the cars,

367
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,005
and then you have to go

368
00:12:41,006 --> 00:12:42,338
and pitch those cars

369
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:43,640
as a series to drivers

370
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,640
to come and drive them to compete?

371
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,400
Is that how it works?

372
00:12:46,401 --> 00:12:47,922
Yeah. Something like that.

373
00:12:47,923 --> 00:12:48,560
Yeah. You need to start

374
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,920
building your connections and

375
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,720
get to know more teams and more drivers

376
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,684
and convince them that your series

377
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:57,161
have a value for them

378
00:12:57,162 --> 00:12:59,466
because it has a lower barrier for entry

379
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:01,523
and it's very fast the cars

380
00:13:01,524 --> 00:13:03,960
and you have a lot of exposure.

381
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,762
So people will see you

382
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:06,289
if you want to start your career

383
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,160
and stuff like that.

384
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,680
But starting that we were very focused

385
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,386
on the series when we started

386
00:13:11,387 --> 00:13:13,440
back in 2018.

387
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,634
But again, we wanted to,

388
00:13:15,635 --> 00:13:17,280
we we were a very,

389
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,160
we were still but back then,

390
00:13:20,161 --> 00:13:22,320
we were a very small

391
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,240
young tech company and we thought, okay,

392
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:26,296
what else we can do

393
00:13:26,297 --> 00:13:28,137
to make our cars better,

394
00:13:28,138 --> 00:13:30,960
to differentiate them from other cars.

395
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,560
And we wanted

396
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,480
to give the drivers the ability to not

397
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,912
need to hire experts to help him improve.

398
00:13:39,913 --> 00:13:41,800
Because motorsports,

399
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,800
like it's very data centric sport.

400
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,400
You need to rely on data to improve.

401
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,000
It's not as simple as kicking

402
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,640
a ball into the goal or something.

403
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,480
Even in that area, we are starting

404
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,280
to see more and more data coming in.

405
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,760
Right.

406
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,800
Motorsport on the cars,

407
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,023
you have a lot of sensors already

408
00:14:00,024 --> 00:14:00,983
and you need to know

409
00:14:00,984 --> 00:14:03,280
how to use that data to improve.

410
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,116
And drivers usually don't know that.

411
00:14:05,117 --> 00:14:08,120
You need to hire that expert to do that.

412
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,320
And we said, okay, we can

413
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,959
go around that expert

414
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,144
and give the driver those tips

415
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:18,640
on how to improve automatically.

416
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,840
If we make all the cars connected

417
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,773
we upload the data

418
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:23,010
we analyze the data in real time

419
00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:25,720
and we give that to the drivers.

420
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,800
And that's where we started

421
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,760
developing our data platform.

422
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,840
Again, it was for the driver.

423
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,520
We had the dream.

424
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,611
Like, imagine you're driving

425
00:14:32,612 --> 00:14:33,887
and you're seeing,

426
00:14:33,888 --> 00:14:36,043
like you hear what you need to improve

427
00:14:36,044 --> 00:14:36,941
or you see that

428
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,200
on the dashboard of something.

429
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,280
But the car teaches you.

430
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,160
That's what we wanted to do.

431
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,760
But then we started the series.

432
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,080
We understood that this solution

433
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,600
is not limited only for the driver

434
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,560
because it's a series.

435
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,120
You want to also differentiate yourself.

436
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,930
You want to attract viewers

437
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:53,360
that will bring sponsors,

438
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,120
that will bring more drivers.

439
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,480
[--]

440
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
So, yeah, exactly.

441
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
Down spiral. You did the exact

442
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,800
motion that we are doing.

443
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,680
And Marco, our EVP of Media Solutions,

444
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,000
will be super proud when he see you.

445
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,760
Because this is what he do,

446
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,880
does all the time. Anyway,

447
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,340
so, we understood that

448
00:15:15,341 --> 00:15:17,331
we have a solution here

449
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:18,376
that no one has

450
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:20,880
and no one else developed that yet.

451
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,240
We looked for other solutions.

452
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,480
We couldn't find anyone, anything.

453
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,040
And then we thought, okay,

454
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,880
that's what we need to do.

455
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,680
We need to develop

456
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,880
that platform for racing.

457
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,505
And this is where we like

458
00:15:32,506 --> 00:15:33,651
we saw the light

459
00:15:33,652 --> 00:15:35,440
and we didn't look back since.

460
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,600
And that's what you're seeing around.

461
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,652
And like and my background,

462
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:42,200
you see different user interfaces,

463
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,240
like the data augmentation we do

464
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,160
for the linear TV broadcast,

465
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,720
the overview screen

466
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,960
that if you're a driver

467
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,209
you can go and see where you are

468
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,327
compared to other drivers.

469
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,200
The briefing screens

470
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,158
for the drivers to see where they do

471
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,680
what they did good or bad.

472
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,320
And a second stream viewing

473
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,960
interface for the end users

474
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,440
or the viewers and many more.

475
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,960
And that's what we're doing now.

476
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,840
We are also implementing

477
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,040
the connectivity to eSports,

478
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,998
which is a crazy thing because

479
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:17,840
this is also something unique

480
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,560
for motorsport in racing.

481
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,080
And unlike other sports,

482
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,320
the game that you play is similar

483
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,720
completely to driving a car,

484
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,120
except for the acceleration.

485
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,040
Because you sit at home

486
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,130
with your steering wheel

487
00:16:32,131 --> 00:16:33,720
and the pedals, you can buy a kit.

488
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,120
It's not expensive.

489
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,040
But when you play NBA 2K

490
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,597
or FIFA.

491
00:16:39,797 --> 00:16:41,920
You don't have a basketball and a hoop, right?

492
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,000
No, no.

493
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,880
You cannot see yourself

494
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,200
going on the court

495
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,292
with LeBron James

496
00:16:46,293 --> 00:16:47,640
and going to play against him.

497
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,120
But if you are a super thin driver,

498
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,800
actually, you can go on track.

499
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,480
You need to be fit and race with the best

500
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,040
and you'll see your fast.

501
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,084
I can already imagine

502
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:02,519
the virtual reality headsets

503
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,960
that are already placing you in there with

504
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,000
potentially vibrating chair

505
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,800
that can mimic the acceleration.

506
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,120
That's crazy.

507
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,280
Yeah.

508
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,200
So that's what we call

509
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,040
mixed reality races.

510
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,841
And this is something the platform

511
00:17:15,842 --> 00:17:18,520
is going to also because it's

512
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,920
a data platform eventually.

513
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,480
And we can collect data from cars,

514
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,080
we collect the data from simulators.

515
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,600
It's the same thing

516
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:29,600
and we merge them together.

517
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,240
Wow.

518
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,200
That's just unbelievable.

519
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,720
And so, tell me a little bit about

520
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,480
the future of the racing sport, because

521
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,200
cars are becoming more autonomous.

522
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,800
I'm watching

523
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,440
the different cars on the road like Tesla

524
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,600
already advertising that they go

525
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,920
to zero to 60 in three seconds.

526
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,920
Is this going to affect

527
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,480
in any way racing?

528
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,880
Are we ever going to see autonomous cars

529
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,360
racing each other, you know,

530
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,360
potentially also against humans?

531
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,760
So, you'll be surprised,

532
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,376
but there are already autonomous cars

533
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:06,720
racing each other.

534
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,200
There was a thing called the Roborace

535
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,280
and they are autonomous cars

536
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,320
that are racing to each other.

537
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,040
It's pretty cool.

538
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,909
Motorsport traditionally was the,

539
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,160
it acted as development platform

540
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,560
for the automotive industry.

541
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,520
So you see a lot of manufacturers

542
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,840
developing technologies on track.

543
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,920
And then those technologies

544
00:18:27,921 --> 00:18:30,084
are being conveyed to the road cars

545
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:31,320
that you are using.

546
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,200
And we see that very strongly today

547
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,480
with the electric revolution,

548
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,560
that those electric components are being

549
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,544
taken to the limit on the track

550
00:18:41,545 --> 00:18:44,680
and getting their tracks that stand.

551
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,480
And then you can use that.

552
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,800
So motorsport will play, as I see it,

553
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,920
a very significant role

554
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,040
in the years to come

555
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,160
as the, again,

556
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,560
the place where all those new

557
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,280
technologies will be perfected.

558
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,000
And also, even when

559
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,480
in whenever it comes

560
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,600
and the roads will be filled

561
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:06,429
with autonomous cars

562
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,720
and you will not be allowed to drive,

563
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,720
I think those islands where you can

564
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,480
experience that human emotion,

565
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,320
that is one of the most amazing.

566
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,240
You know, if you can fly a jet fighter,

567
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,920
maybe it can be more exciting, but

568
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,040
taking a car on on track to the limit

569
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,240
is something that it's crazy.

570
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,720
It's amazing experience.

571
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,240
And I don't see that disappear.

572
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,760
I hope never.

573
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,813
Now, I'm going to have to go

574
00:19:38,814 --> 00:19:40,229
and try that for myself

575
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,920
because it sounds exhilarating.

576
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,386
Being a little bit distance from the field,

577
00:19:45,387 --> 00:19:48,640
you never actually imagine yourself there.

578
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,160
But now, I can see why the excitement.

579
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,510
I can see the thrill and I can

580
00:19:52,511 --> 00:19:54,280
more than anything see the potential

581
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,360
of what you're doing here.

582
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,983
A data driven platform for motor racing,

583
00:19:57,984 --> 00:19:59,360
both for the driver,

584
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,760
but also for the game,

585
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,960
for the player at home,

586
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,400
for the viewer on the TV and for the team

587
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,520
that is debriefing after and also

588
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,799
the manufacturer of the car

589
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,742
that wants to see, okay,

590
00:20:08,743 --> 00:20:10,665
how did the driver interact with the car,

591
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:11,800
what were the limitations,

592
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,840
how did we hold up against others.

593
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,801
I think that you're exactly

594
00:20:15,802 --> 00:20:16,957
on to what it should be

595
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,120
and it's really really impressive.

596
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,960
Thank you, Tamir, for taking the time

597
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,080
to share this with me.

598
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,388
Before we leave,

599
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:23,668
I have to ask you

600
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:25,320
for the hardest question.

601
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,360
Three words that you would use

602
00:20:26,361 --> 00:20:28,200
to describe yourself.

603
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:31,843
I just wanted before I answer,

604
00:20:31,844 --> 00:20:32,680
I have to say

605
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:34,080
that you describe it perfectly.

606
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,359
Because what we are saying

607
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,776
that we are doing is

608
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,480
creating a digital universe

609
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,137
around racing grants.

610
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:43,079
You described that universe

611
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,600
of the users so beautiful.

612
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,680
The three words.

613
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,240
Determined, I think.

614
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,200
Creative.

615
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,520
Yeah.

616
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,960
Optimistic. Energetic.

617
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,480
I don't know.

618
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,300
Yeah, I think the first two

619
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:10,280
were much easier.

620
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,160
That's why it's the hardest question.

621
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,568
And I'll take all those four or five words.

622
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:18,080
All those seem to me makes perfect sense.

623
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,320
But I think that the first two are

624
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,520
the strong, like what I say,

625
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,360
I think can describe myself the best.

626
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,320
100%. The story of growing up in Israel

627
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,240
with practically no industry,

628
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,560
but yet you have the passion

629
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,200
and motivation to go there,

630
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,320
creating this grassroots program within

631
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,920
Ben Gurion University in Beer Sheva,

632
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,400
the team that is going to race

633
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,320
with the car in Italy,

634
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,560
going to land a job

635
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,560
in Italy, coming back,

636
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,800
starting a company based in Israel

637
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,280
that creates a series in Italy.

638
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,593
I mean,

639
00:21:47,594 --> 00:21:49,080
the whole stories of determination

640
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,880
and perseverance

641
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,680
and creativity above it all.

642
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,800
So, thank you, Tamir,

643
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:54,240
again for the inspiration.

644
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,400
This was wonderful. Toda raba.

645
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,240
And stay safe and healthy.

646
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,240
Yeah.

647
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,800
My pleasure and honor.

648
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,080
Thank you.
