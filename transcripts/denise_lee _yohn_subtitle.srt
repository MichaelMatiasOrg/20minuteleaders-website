1
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Okay.

2
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,560
Denise Lee Yohn, thank you so much

3
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,280
for being on my show.

4
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,280
How are you?

5
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:35,800
I'm good.

6
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,040
Thank you so much for having me.

7
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,880
I am extremely excited to have you.

8
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,960
Brand leadership, culture, messaging,

9
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,680
best selling author of Fusion,

10
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,680
and What Great Brands Do.

11
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,120
You assist so many different companies

12
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,760
on their brand leadership

13
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,760
and messaging and culture

14
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,800
that I'm so excited to pick your brain

15
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,960
in the next 20 minutes

16
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,800
on what that even means.

17
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,520
Can you tell me

18
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,400
a little bit about yourself

19
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,160
and what is branding in general?

20
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,920
Yeah, yeah.

21
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,400
Well, so the number one thing

22
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
you need to know about me

23
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,960
is that I love brands.

24
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,320
I've been very passionate about brands,

25
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,000
not only as a consumer or customer,

26
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,680
I have my favorite brands,

27
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,920
but as a professional.

28
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,560
I really try to understand

29
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,920
how brands really engage people,

30
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,080
seduce people,

31
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,560
invite people into their community,

32
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,600
into their world, and people,

33
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,480
both customers and employees

34
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,000
and other partners.

35
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,760
And so, you ask me

36
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,600
about the definition of branding,

37
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,560
and I actually, frankly,

38
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,360
don't use the term branding.

39
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,360
Because I think that, branding,

40
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,880
if you think about where it came,

41
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,880
where the term came from, it was when,

42
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
back when people had cattle and ranches

43
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,520
and they would brand their cows

44
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,560
with their logos

45
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,720
so that people would know

46
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,280
that the cows belong to them.

47
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,320
And that's really not what is necessary

48
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,160
or appropriate or compelling

49
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,760
in today's [--].

50
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,560
We're not putting our logos on things

51
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,840
just so that people know

52
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,680
who owns it or who it belongs to.

53
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,560
What I consider to be brand building

54
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,560
is much more about

55
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,280
what you do and how you do it.

56
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,800
So, it really becomes very much

57
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,160
a part of your business strategy

58
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,520
and your operations,

59
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,200
and to your point,

60
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,760
your culture and your organization.

61
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,080
So, why is this even a topic

62
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,680
that needs discussion?

63
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,160
Why do so many people

64
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,520
and companies struggle with

65
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,160
exactly what you're talking about?

66
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,440
Yeah. Well, I think a lot of companies

67
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,880
still do think about their branding,

68
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,120
so they'd think about:

69
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,880
what should our name be,

70
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,200
what should our logo look like,

71
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,120
what should our website look like,

72
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,880
what should our colors be,

73
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,080
and all of that things are important

74
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,000
because we are communicating

75
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,040
and trying to engage people

76
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,400
through communications.

77
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,400
But if you don't have

78
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,120
the strategic foundation

79
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,880
of what you stand for,

80
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,360
what your values are,

81
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,480
how you're engaging your employees

82
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,480
to deliver great customer experiences,

83
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,040
and what is your differentiation

84
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,920
and all of that,

85
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,840
then you really don't have a brand.

86
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,520
You don't have something

87
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,720
that is meaningful and valuable

88
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,040
and that really can create

89
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,040
that connection for you.

90
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,480
Talk to me a bit about your journey.

91
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,720
How do you even get started with

92
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,200
becoming passionate about this topic

93
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,880
and helping others then overcome it?

94
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,600
Yeah.

95
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,640
So, I studied liberal arts background.

96
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,360
And in college I was a psychology,

97
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,440
political science double major.

98
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,520
And my first job out of school

99
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,160
was in marketing.

100
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,960
I was a market research analyst.

101
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,680
And so, my first few jobs

102
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,400
were really foundational,

103
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,920
in a sense of learning in market research,

104
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,280
learning to understand

105
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,520
how consumers made decisions

106
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,760
and how companies

107
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,960
could communicate with them

108
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,920
to influence those decisions.

109
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,600
I also did some product management.

110
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,640
So, really figuring out

111
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,000
how do you research and develop products

112
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,480
and how you bring them to market.

113
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,080
And then I worked

114
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,280
in the advertising agency

115
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,200
to really figure out how do you create

116
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,680
the creative communications

117
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,560
and the engagement with customers.

118
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,320
And out of all those experiences,

119
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,120
Sony Electronics recruited me

120
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,080
and I end up starting up

121
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,280
their first ever brand office.

122
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,320
Wow.

123
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,720
And it was there at Sony,

124
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,320
that I really learned so much

125
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,080
about the value of internal

126
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,400
organizational alignment and engagement.

127
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,760
At the time, this is back in the 90s,

128
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,120
so I'm definitely dating myself,

129
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,320
but Sony had just started

130
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,040
to see some chinks in the armor

131
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,600
as Apple was rising.

132
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,880
And the thing about Apple is that

133
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,560
their emotional connection

134
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,040
and their ability to just create

135
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,280
this relationship with their customers

136
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,840
is so powerful.

137
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,240
And Sony definitely wanted

138
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,320
to compete on that.

139
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,560
But without the internal understanding

140
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,640
of how were we going to do that,

141
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,040
what does Sony really stand for,

142
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,280
what do we really have to offer,

143
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,080
we couldn't compete

144
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,440
on speeds and feeds anymore

145
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,960
because Apple and other players,

146
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,400
definitely, were doing

147
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,160
[--].

148
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,640
So, what was that emotional connection

149
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,360
that we create.

150
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,720
And we, internally within Sony, didn't have

151
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,640
one common understanding of that.

152
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,040
There was no way we were going to build

153
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040
to deliver on that externally.

154
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,000
So, I learned a lot about that at Sony.

155
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,440
And then for a variety of reasons,

156
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,520
which I can tell you

157
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,120
over a drink sometime,

158
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,840
I end up resigning my job

159
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,650
and starting my own brand consultancy

160
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,720
where I can start consulting practice.

161
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,960
And do that for quite a few years,

162
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,240
had some opportunities

163
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,280
to work on these great brands

164
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,800
that you were referring to.

165
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,000
And then over time have really shifted

166
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,320
from doing a lot of consulting

167
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,400
and a little bit of speaking and writing,

168
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,280
to doing mostly speaking and writing

169
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,560
and then just a little bit of consulting.

170
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,800
Right. So now, getting this message across

171
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,000
and helping others understand

172
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,640
engagement better and culture.

173
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,240
And then why is engagement difficult

174
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,480
internally within a company?

175
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,200
So, I'm now asking

176
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,080
as a young entrepreneur,

177
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,200
as I go through my journey

178
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,920
of hopefully building a company

179
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,520
and thinking about culture myself

180
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,600
and growing the team,

181
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,000
I now get to be a part of 8200

182
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,520
in 70 person team

183
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,440
in the hypergrowth company

184
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,040
and seeing the culture,

185
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,880
what are some pitfalls

186
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,520
that the leaders make

187
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,000
when they're trying to engage

188
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,280
both their consumers

189
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,520
but also their employees?

190
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,400
And then, what are some important things

191
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,320
to keep in mind?

192
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,040
Yeah. Well, actually,

193
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,840
a lot happens in that journey

194
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,000
that you just described.

195
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,440
Because I think that when you were small

196
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,880
and just starting up,

197
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,080
you and your co-founders probably have

198
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,800
a really clear vision

199
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,840
on what you want to stand for

200
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,680
and the kind of company

201
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,440
you want to create.

202
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,600
But I think that,

203
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,280
often what happens is either:

204
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,240
a, you take that for granted

205
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,760
and as you add more people

206
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,240
you just assume that everyone gets it;

207
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,920
and or B, you get so consumed

208
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,960
with operations and development

209
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,840
and really trying to build a business

210
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,120
that those things overtake your desire

211
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,680
to create this great organization.

212
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,680
And so, in the scaling process,

213
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,960
you lose that focus on

214
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,320
really what are we about

215
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,080
and really what are we creating.

216
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,960
And so then you wake up one day,

217
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,400
and like you say

218
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,920
you have 200 employees and you're like,

219
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,640
oh my gosh, and our culture sucks.

220
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,120
And you were competing

221
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,560
in this brutal war for talent

222
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,000
and we are trying to offer

223
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
an experience to our employees

224
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,840
that may or may not be competitive.

225
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,600
And so, I think that you really need to,

226
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,920
as a leader of your organization,

227
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,080
as one of the people

228
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,600
who's driving the growth,

229
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,680
you need to be very intensely focused

230
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,720
on prioritizing culture building.

231
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,680
Understand it doesn't just happen.

232
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,720
And we need to be

233
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,760
not only talking about it all the time

234
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,520
to make sure that you're clear

235
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,640
on the kind of culture you want

236
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,360
and the kind of organization you want,

237
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,160
but then also role modeling that culture.

238
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,040
So, you can't just be all words.

239
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,640
You need to be action.

240
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,640
And then finally that,

241
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,000
you are actually designing

242
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,480
and running the organization

243
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,160
to cultivate that kind of culture.

244
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,920
So, which departments

245
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,360
or which groups in your company

246
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,120
need to be working together better

247
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,040
or you need to make sure

248
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,160
there's really tight alignment integration

249
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,920
and make sure that you're cultivating that

250
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,880
in the way that you run the organization.

251
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,560
Are there certain employee experiences

252
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,280
or employee rituals or artifacts

253
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,560
or policies and procedures,

254
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,440
all of these things

255
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,840
you need to be thinking about

256
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,080
as you put those in place

257
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,920
to make sure that they represent

258
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,000
and really support and advance

259
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,160
your desired culture.

260
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,720
So, culture building really

261
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,680
is a strategic leadership responsibility

262
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,220
that you as a founder

263
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,120
or as an entrepreneur

264
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,480
need to be accepting that responsibility

265
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,080
and championing it.

266
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,640
I think that's fascinating.

267
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,640
I heard you speak

268
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,080
at a few other occurrences

269
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,280
and a lot of the times,

270
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,000
it's this idea that, yeah,

271
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,600
we can put posters on the wall

272
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,600
that scream our culture and our messaging.

273
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,480
But then actions speak louder than words.

274
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,080
And when I think about brand

275
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,680
and when I think about

276
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,480
what a company expresses,

277
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,480
people always think outside of the company,

278
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,480
how are outside consumers

279
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,840
going to interact with our products.

280
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,680
But then, I think people also forget,

281
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,560
and I sometimes forget that at the end

282
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,680
it's the people building these products

283
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,840
have to live by these experiences

284
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,040
and by these messages

285
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,960
so that they can develop the products

286
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,080
that other people will be happy about.

287
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,160
What are some common themes

288
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,480
that you're seeing as startups are scaling,

289
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,400
with the pitfalls that leaders are making

290
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,680
as they're losing out of the culture?

291
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,560
Is it simply that they forget

292
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,760
or do other things come in the way?

293
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,240
Yeah. Well, oftentimes

294
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,040
they'll delegate it to someone.

295
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,520
So, again, as a founder or leader,

296
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,080
you've got lots of responsibilities.

297
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,280
And so, you think,

298
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,180
"I can't do everything."

299
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,720
"I'm going to hire good people

300
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,680
to work for me."

301
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,440
And certainly,

302
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,720
you need to have a strong goal

303
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,400
to execute your strategies

304
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,280
and to help you implement your tactics.

305
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,000
But you can't, as a leader,

306
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
ever abdicate your responsibility

307
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,720
for culture building.

308
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,880
And if you don't give, let's say you have

309
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,280
a head of employee experience

310
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,680
or head of HR,

311
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,880
if you don't give them the tools

312
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,360
and investment and resources they need

313
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,560
to create this great employee experience,

314
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,560
they're going to be hamstrung.

315
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,160
And so, their effectiveness

316
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,680
is very much tied to your buy into this.

317
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,200
So, it's really important for you

318
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,960
to make sure that

319
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,160
you are continuing to lead.

320
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,080
The other things, I think,

321
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,200
is to understand that

322
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,960
your values as an organization

323
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,240
need to be woven

324
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,000
into everything that you do.

325
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,640
Again, like I said,

326
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,320
they can't just be words on a page.

327
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,920
But you need to be applying them,

328
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,840
especially to your people decisions:

329
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,800
who to hire, who to fire,

330
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,160
who to promote, who to develop.

331
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,440
And you need to be using your values

332
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,320
as a filter or as a screen

333
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,400
for your people,

334
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,160
not only because that will make sure

335
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,680
that you have the right people

336
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,600
on the right positions

337
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,840
doing the right work,

338
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,040
but that's also probably

339
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,800
one of the most important

340
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,240
or most influential ways

341
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,120
that you share your values

342
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,480
with the organization.

343
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,640
If someone sees you saying that

344
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,360
creativity and risk taking is important,

345
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,880
but you are always penalizing people

346
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,880
when they fail

347
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,560
or you're actually firing people

348
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,640
because they failed or they took a risk

349
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,880
and it didn't turn out,

350
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,360
then people are going to be like,

351
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,520
"Well, wait a minute."

352
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,440
That value that you were talking about

353
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,240
doesn't really seem

354
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,760
to be a reality, really.

355
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,400
Also you need to be thinking,

356
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,120
okay, if this is the kind of value

357
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,840
that I want to have my organization,

358
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,280
the best way to show

359
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,640
that I mean what I say

360
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,120
is in my decisions about people.

361
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,120
100%. And I think it also speaks

362
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,160
to the hire slow, fire fast.

363
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,280
This idea that think about the people

364
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,160
that are in the company,

365
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,440
they're not just skillful people

366
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,440
that are getting things done,

367
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,160
but every hire

368
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,240
is going to impact the culture.

369
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,680
And obviously,

370
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,360
the higher up in the ladder you go,

371
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,640
the more critical it is.

372
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,160
What are some incredible things

373
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,560
that you've seen people do

374
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,640
in order to create good engagement

375
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,520
with their employees

376
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,240
or their customers outside?

377
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,120
Some things that

378
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,080
I might not even be thinking of

379
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,840
as I'm growing my own company.

380
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,960
I get a lot of examples from Airbnb

381
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,400
because I did a deep dive

382
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,520
into that organization

383
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,560
when I wrote my book, FUSION.

384
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,920
And so, they created

385
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,880
an employee experience department

386
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
where they brought in

387
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,640
all the different functions

388
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,840
that impact an employees,

389
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,640
their day to day experience,

390
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,720
and brought them together under one person

391
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,120
and into one consolidated group,

392
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,960
which meant that they were looking

393
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,280
at the employee experience

394
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,960
the way that you look

395
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,920
at a customer experience,

396
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,120
like the journey that employee has

397
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,680
throughout their tenure.

398
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,800
And so, they started

399
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,560
their employee experience

400
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,120
during recruiting, where in addition

401
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,360
to all of the functional screens

402
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,040
that someone has to go through

403
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,160
as a potential worker,

404
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,120
who also are interviewed twice

405
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,040
just based on values.

406
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,880
And that way

407
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,880
the company really gets to know

408
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,200
what your values are

409
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,080
and gets to assess

410
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,040
whether there's alignment

411
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,680
with the company's values.

412
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,120
And what's really interesting is:

413
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,480
a, that these values interviews

414
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,800
are not done by the hiring manager,

415
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,920
they're done by members of a committee

416
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,120
specifically designated

417
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,920
towards values reviews;

418
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,960
and two, if they decide

419
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,280
that this candidate

420
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,880
is not a fit culturally

421
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,560
or is not aligned to the values,

422
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,480
they can actually override the hiring,

423
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,840
even though those person could be

424
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,320
absolutely the right skills,

425
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,360
right experience,

426
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,680
the company is not going to hire them.

427
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,120
So, I mean, it's like having a very

428
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,120
prescriptive, strict standards

429
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,040
that enables a company like Airbnb

430
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,080
to attract the kind of people

431
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,840
who really believe in the mission

432
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,440
and who work by the values.

433
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,640
And then on the back side,

434
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,240
in the recent months,

435
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,800
Airbnb had to lay off a lot of employees.

436
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,240
Yes.

437
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,160
And the way that they've done so,

438
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,080
in the letter from Brian Chesky,

439
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,560
just the humanity

440
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,120
and the compassion and empathy

441
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,360
that was demonstrated through that

442
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,800
is another sign of how seriously

443
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,840
the company takes the employee experience

444
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,880
and [--].

445
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,600
Definitely. 100%

446
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
So, you made a conscious decision yourself

447
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,160
to transition your experience from that

448
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,840
of building the brand of a certain company

449
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,000
and culture of a certain company

450
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,720
to now looking in the broader picture

451
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,040
about a lot of different companies.

452
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,320
So, first of all,

453
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,080
I'd love to hear about this transition.

454
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,280
And why are you so excited

455
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,720
about the work that you're doing now?

456
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,760
Yeah. Well, I felt like

457
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,800
I could have a lot more impact

458
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,320
on a lot more companies

459
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,720
if I were to increase

460
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
my speaking business

461
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,880
and increased my writing,

462
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,840
and really just try

463
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,120
to get my ideas out more.

464
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,120
When you work for a single company

465
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,240
or when you do

466
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,560
the kind of brand consulting

467
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,840
that I first was doing

468
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,720
when I first came out of Sony,

469
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,400
there is deep dive into the organization.

470
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,160
And so, you can really affect change

471
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,080
within that one organization.

472
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,240
But I felt like I was limited in a way,

473
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,360
and especially because,

474
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,360
unlike maybe the folks

475
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,520
who are listening to this interview,

476
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,560
I wasn't going to grow a big company.

477
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,880
It was just going to be me.

478
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,320
I wasn't going to have any employees.

479
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,080
And the rate limiting factor

480
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,690
is my bandwidth.

481
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:59,920
So, if I were to impact

482
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,440
the most people that I can,

483
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,760
it's going to have to be

484
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,960
through speaking and writing.

485
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,080
And it turns out that I think

486
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,680
when I did a lot of self-examination

487
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,640
about what I got excited about

488
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,440
and what I found life-giving,

489
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,520
what I felt like I really wanted

490
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,960
to get better and better at,

491
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,360
like it was a passion of mine

492
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,320
to really hone my skills set,

493
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,320
it was speaking.

494
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,880
It was really getting out there

495
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,000
in front of people and figure out

496
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,200
how do I share what's in my head

497
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,920
and all the research and experience

498
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,000
that I've had

499
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,800
and be able to communicate that

500
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,600
in a way that they understand.

501
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,960
That's just fascinating to me.

502
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,680
100%.

503
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,200
So, that's what gets me up

504
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,040
every day, really.

505
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,840
I love it.

506
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,360
I did love that challenge.

507
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,080
I love it.

508
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,560
So, alongside that messaging,

509
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,320
so Fusion, What Great Brands Do,

510
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,440
tell me a little bit about each book

511
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,040
and what I can expect to find in there.

512
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,920
And maybe one or two nuggets

513
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,760
that we can extrapolate from each.

514
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,760
Yeah. Yeah.

515
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,200
So, What Great Brands Do,

516
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,840
the seven brand building principles

517
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,360
that separates the best from the rest.

518
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,360
Now this book came out in 2014

519
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,780
so some of the examples

520
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,120
are a little bit dated,

521
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,520
but I continue to hear from people today

522
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,400
how informative these seven principles are

523
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,580
because it really takes with you

524
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,120
some counter-intuitive practices

525
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,000
of brand building.

526
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,960
Like great brands avoid selling products.

527
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,000
Like they don't push products on people

528
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,720
promote features in a top-tier technology.

529
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,640
They're much more, as I said earlier,

530
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,800
into the business of seducing people

531
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,680
and incline people in it

532
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,560
and making an emotional connection.

533
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,320
As my book shows you how to do that

534
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,280
gives you some tools

535
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,360
to bring what's in

536
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,400
lots of case studies and examples.

537
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:38,920
Right.

538
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,480
My second book, Fusion:

539
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,000
How Integrating Brand and Culture

540
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,080
Powers The World's Greatest Companies,

541
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,840
is about how you take

542
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,400
your internal organizational culture

543
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,000
and your external brand identity

544
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,880
and ensure that they are

545
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,640
mutually reinforcing

546
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,960
and definitely integrated and aligned

547
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,520
and intertwined in such a way

548
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,240
that you really are on the inside

549
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,800
what you say on the outside.

550
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,200
Because then, not only do you engage

551
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,480
your people really effectively,

552
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,200
but you pass the customer test

553
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,280
of brand authenticity.

554
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,480
Because these days,

555
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,640
customers want to know

556
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,160
really what's behind the curtain

557
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,840
and they have the ability to find out.

558
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,480
So, you want to make sure that

559
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,520
how you're operating the organization

560
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,360
really is with integrity and authenticity.

561
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,840
So, I highly recommend those two books.

562
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,600
And then I will say

563
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,400
for your audience in particular,

564
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,280
I've written a small book called,

565
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,200
parts of the paper really,

566
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,920
a change this manifesto

567
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,520
about minimum viable brand.

568
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,840
It's all based

569
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,400
on the minimal viable product.

570
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,240
Yeah.

571
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,320
But given that you're going to have

572
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,240
limited resources and limited time

573
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,840
when you're first starting out,

574
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,080
what are the few things

575
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,880
that you need to make sure

576
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,960
that you have in place

577
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,600
as you're building your brand.

578
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,200
And so, all of these things

579
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,680
can be found on my website

580
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,520
and hopefully they'll be good resources

581
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,640
for your folks.

582
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,040
100%. I think, everything you talked about

583
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,760
is just fascinating.

584
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,720
I think that today, especially in 2020,

585
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,720
and we've seen it especially this year,

586
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,640
how important company culture is

587
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,920
both in terms of adapting to lay offs

588
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,160
and a lot of the stuff

589
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,160
that's been coming out over recent years

590
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,280
in company culture is, I think,

591
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,840
things that people in my years of studying

592
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,600
and people in my age group

593
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,520
that are starting companies

594
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,760
we're very very conscious of.

595
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,640
And we're always thinking,

596
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,720
okay, from day zero,

597
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,240
how do we get the right culture.

598
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,080
And just the other day,

599
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,240
my good friend who has just finished

600
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,360
the Stanford Business School, he asked me,

601
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,360
"Michael, what is going to be your schtick

602
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,000
as a CEO?"

603
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,560
"I'm going to be the Nature CEO,

604
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,280
and that's the culture

605
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,200
that I want to build in my company."

606
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,640
And people are thinking

607
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,600
of what types of the niche markets

608
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,960
they like to address and what type

609
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,160
of cultures and communities

610
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,040
they want to build,

611
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,480
I think that's amazing.

612
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,440
I know that in the company

613
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,840
that I'm with now, Hippo Insurance,

614
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,480
the culture is incredible.

615
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,480
And I'm really I'm fascinated

616
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,840
to sit next to the CEO

617
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,680
and I get to talk to him about the way

618
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,200
that he addresses these problems.

619
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,200
And every onboarding process

620
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,960
is a new adventure and a new celebration

621
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,320
by over 200 people,

622
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,040
which is just incredible.

623
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,360
But Denise, before we leave,

624
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:09,800
I have to ask you

625
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,160
the most important question,

626
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,240
three words that you would use

627
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,800
to describe yourself.

628
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,800
Yeah, you know, Michael,

629
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,560
that's such a hard question.

630
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,840
It's the hardest one.

631
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,160
And I don't prepare enough.

632
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,560
So, I'm sorry as well.

633
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,560
So, I have two and maybe a third one

634
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,120
will come to me.

635
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,080
So, definitely driven.

636
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,600
So, I'll go with this driven.

637
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,360
I am definitely like someone

638
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,600
who sees a goal, sets a goal,

639
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,400
goes after it.

640
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,880
And two, I'm very disciplined.

641
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,560
In the sense that

642
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,920
I can have my way of doing things.

643
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,200
My whole life is arranged in a way

644
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,560
so that I can achieve my goals.

645
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,960
And so, those are the two.

646
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,080
I don't know the third one.

647
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,760
I'm not sure, I would say maybe

648
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,160
this is more than one word,

649
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,680
but since I'm doing the [--],

650
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,360
I'm dedicated to my faith

651
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,200
in the sense that I'm a person of faith

652
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,280
and I really am guided by my faith.

653
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,200
And so, that provides the center

654
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,520
and the core for me.

655
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,160
So, I could have cheated

656
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,320
and use more than one word

657
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,000
on that last one.

658
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,520
That's perfectly fine.

659
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,760
I'm disciplined and dedicated

660
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,280
to my faith.

661
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,120
Denise, thank you very very much.

662
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,760
This is fascinating.

663
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,800
I can't wait to read these books myself.

664
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,040
It sounds like it's something

665
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,400
that's incredibly insightful

666
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,680
for any young entrepreneur or any leader

667
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,040
that wants to affect change

668
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,840
in their own community,

669
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,000
whether it's in a company

670
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,400
or whether it's in the simple community,

671
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,320
in their family or whatever it is.

672
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,440
It sounds like it's relevant

673
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,160
for a lot of different things

674
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,120
besides business.

675
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,360
Thank you very very much, Denise.

676
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,000
I really appreciate it.

677
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,200
Stay safe and stay healthy.

678
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,000
Bye bye.
