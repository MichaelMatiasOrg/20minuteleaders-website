1
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,200
Okay. Guy Miasnik, thank you so much

2
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,520
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,040
How are you?

4
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,520
Very good, Michael.

5
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,120
Thank you for having me here.

6
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,920
Of course you're good.

7
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,560
Look at this view

8
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,440
that you're talking from.

9
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,000
Where are you now?

10
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,840
I am now from my home office.

11
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,800
This is covid time.

12
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,080
We are all shuttering in place.

13
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,840
Well, it's a beautiful

14
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,360
beautiful home office.

15
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
But the view,

16
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,240
the view is from Mount Rose in Tahoe.

17
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,160
And that's where I was two weeks ago,

18
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,560
climbing with my bike up, and so.

19
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,120
Climbing with your what?

20
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,860
Bike. Bike.

21
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,760
I didn't know you can climb with a bike.

22
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,560
With the motorcycle.

23
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,300
Yeah. When we a have mountains also,

24
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,080
but they're in Tahoe.

25
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,800
You basically walk up and you climb.

26
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,840
Work hard. Play hard.

27
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,720
Guy, we have so much to talk about

28
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,800
because, the most fascinating thing

29
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,720
that as you know,

30
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,040
and in preparation for this

31
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,280
I asked a simple question.

32
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,320
I want to talk about

33
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,520
the things you're passionate about.

34
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,720
And your different experiences.

35
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,160
And I listed like seven things

36
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,200
we could talk about, because you were

37
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,320
the chief strategy officer

38
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,120
of the BlackBerry.

39
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,360
And you sold the company

40
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,840
for $200 million to BlackBerry,

41
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,560
and HBS, and so on.

42
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,640
And you mentioned,

43
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,360
at the essence of it,

44
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,440
you're an entrepreneur.

45
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,840
And that is your true passion.

46
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,240
Beyond the combination

47
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,840
of all of these specific things.

48
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,040
Guy, what does it mean to you

49
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,160
that you are an entrepreneur?

50
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
And you've been an entrepreneur

51
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,880
for quite some time.

52
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,320
So, you pretty have some good

53
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
in your understanding

54
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,720
of what it means to you.

55
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,000
That's a great question, Michael.

56
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,280
So, entrepreneur is really at the essence.

57
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,160
It's in the heart.

58
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,920
It's about an impeccable desire

59
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,160
to create something that makes an impact.

60
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,040
It's about shaping it the way

61
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,120
you believe it should be shaped.

62
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,640
And it's really being having the passion

63
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,080
to work with dedicated

64
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,520
and brilliant people.

65
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,880
These are, for me, the three things

66
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,120
that really make or drive me,

67
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,520
and motivates me,

68
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,800
in the entrepreneurial world.

69
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,200
It's create something.

70
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Make an impact, shape it

71
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,560
and work with amazing people.

72
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,640
And you get that.

73
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,280
And you get that

74
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,800
and you can make that happen

75
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,080
in this kind of the context.

76
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,960
When did you become an entrepreneur?

77
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,400
What was your turning point?

78
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,640
Was it after business school?

79
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,120
Before business school?

80
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,360
In high school.

81
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,920
Okay.

82
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,440
So, my first entrepreneurial venture

83
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,280
[--]

84
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,280
was actually, almost a non profit.

85
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,960
I was in high school in Kfar Saba.

86
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:06,440
And there was a boarding school over there

87
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,040
for very talented kids

88
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,960
that come from a bit

89
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,400
of a more difficult background.

90
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,840
And somehow I got connected

91
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,680
to the head of that boarding school.

92
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,520
And I was sort of as a kid

93
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,520
and as a high school guy.

94
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
I knew computers.

95
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,520
I was passionate about computers and said,

96
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,560
"Listen, I have some amazing,

97
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,560
talented kids in my boarding school."

98
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,960
"And what can you do?"

99
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,400
So, we sat down and I said,

100
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:32,920
"You know what?"

101
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,680
"We are going to create a computer class."

102
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,440
"Computer school

103
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,760
for afternoon activities for your kids."

104
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,920
And you did that.

105
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,640
When did you do that?

106
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,180
This was about six,

107
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,280
or about like latter part of 11th grade.

108
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,320
11th grade? Wow.

109
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,200
And I recruited a couple of my friends.

110
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,440
And we went out

111
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,920
and we built the curriculum.

112
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,960
And we figured out

113
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,400
that we have to purchase some computers

114
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,600
for computer [--]

115
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,920
from some people who donated the money

116
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,000
and we created for them a class

117
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,320
and taught it.

118
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,800
So, it was my first entrepreneur.

119
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,240
Now, it's not a business.

120
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,320
It's not a big startup.

121
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,880
But it was creating something

122
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,640
out of nothing.

123
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,280
I made an impact.

124
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,520
And I did it with some of my best friends.

125
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,360
So, that's entrepreneurship on day one.

126
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,640
That's high school

127
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,320
and then it just continues from there.

128
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,320
I love it. I'm taking so much inspiration.

129
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,760
I'm coming from

130
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,640
a pretty similar background.

131
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,760
I was, I think of myself

132
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,480
pretty entrepreneurial

133
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,160
back in high school.

134
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,080
Especially when it comes to

135
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,680
starting a robotics team.

136
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,160
Or convincing the administration

137
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,200
to have the BC calculus class

138
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,160
even though we don't have it.

139
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,720
And I think the most inspiring thing

140
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,320
is that, after all those years, and after

141
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,680
the incredible journeys you've had,

142
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,480
you still go back

143
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,800
to that high school experience.

144
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,440
Which, like you're saying,

145
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,080
it's not a startup, it's not a business.

146
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,760
But you created value out of thin air,

147
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,960
and that is entrepreneurship.

148
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,640
Give me in two words

149
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,480
this HBS experience.

150
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,560
You're at Harvard Business School,

151
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,840
one of the top places in the world

152
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,080
for entrepreneurship and business,

153
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,080
what are those two years like?

154
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:08,160
A life changing.

155
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,040
So,  I've been entrepreneur before.

156
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,200
I had this one company in Israel.

157
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,960
Successful, got acquired.

158
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,320
But it was small scale.

159
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,520
And the move to HBS into the US

160
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,040
open your eyes.

161
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,040
Opened my eyes as an Israeli.

162
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,560
I'm talking about '97, '98,

163
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,640
to a much broader world.

164
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,840
A much bigger way

165
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,560
of thinking about things.

166
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,560
And HBS does it for you.

167
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,160
It basically shifts your mind

168
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,120
from thinking

169
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,840
in your own network cubicle.

170
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,800
Okay, the last thing that I heard

171
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,840
was life changing.

172
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,920
You come in and you're no longer

173
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,320
in your own cubicle.

174
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,520
And then we froze.

175
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,120
That's actually made the point.

176
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,680
I mean, that's it.

177
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,360
We don't need to continue from that.

178
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,960
But really, the point was,

179
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,920
I actually had my own

180
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,960
little startup in Israel.

181
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,480
Which was a smaller scale startup.

182
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,200
And the move to the states,

183
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,080
the moved to HBS, specifically,

184
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,240
opened your eyes.

185
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,920
Allows us to really think about

186
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,160
much broader issues

187
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,480
and much bigger bigger bigger opportunity.

188
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,560
So, for me, that was a mega transition

189
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,950
coming from the small market of Israel

190
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,540
to the bigger world,

191
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,480
and to what I think about it

192
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,160
in a different way.

193
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,400
So, HBS was amazing.

194
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,840
And then besides that, it's people.

195
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,800
You get a chance to meet

196
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,320
some amazing amazing people.

197
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,200
Those two things.

198
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,640
First of all, I hear life changing,

199
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,440
but then I hear that it's both about,

200
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,000
understanding scale

201
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,760
and meeting incredible people.

202
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,800
What is it about these two years

203
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,560
that make you transition

204
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,400
from thinking small scale nice startup,

205
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
to, I'm going to go and sell a company

206
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,760
for $300 million

207
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,680
and become the CSO of BlackBerry.

208
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,320
Like, what is that transition?

209
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm trying to understand.

210
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,560
Because obviously,

211
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,840
it's one of the dreams of mine

212
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,560
to come to get to a place like this.

213
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,440
But what is it?

214
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,120
So, first of all,

215
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,040
no one starts a startup that knows

216
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,770
that he's going to sell it for 300 million

217
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,680
and becomes CSO of any company.

218
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,200
So, it's really about

219
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,280
having the confidence

220
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,800
to make it different and to go.

221
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,360
Okay? Be ready to say,

222
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,720
I can do it despite

223
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,480
all of those crazy others

224
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,160
and crazy reasons,

225
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,840
and good reasons actually,

226
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,160
not to do anything.

227
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,680
And the fact that you have the confidence

228
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,280
and in some aspect, the crazy mindset

229
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,200
and the extremely optimistic mindset

230
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,760
to say, I'm going to do it, this exit.

231
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,860
And HBS helps that.

232
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,440
HBS actually, as a school

233
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,760
gives you the network,

234
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,760
gives you the confidence,

235
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,760
gives you the way to think about stuff.

236
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,960
And I'm not saying it's the only way.

237
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,000
There's many ways to get

238
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,280
to the kind of I'm on.

239
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,040
And I've been that before.

240
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,920
But it definitely gave me a great boost.

241
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,400
Now, the second thing,

242
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,280
my first investor, my second investor,

243
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,040
my business partner and my board members,

244
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,600
they're all HBS.

245
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,600
So, that helps.

246
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,440
Okay. So, that's the network side.

247
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,760
But to culminate this,

248
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,600
for anybody who doesn't get the chance

249
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,560
to go to  HBS,

250
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,680
or Stanford Business School,

251
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,520
summarize, what is the key takeaway

252
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,960
that resonated

253
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,760
throughout your journey there

254
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,880
that you think,

255
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,240
this is a lesson that really resonates

256
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,520
throughout this experience?

257
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,040
Got it. Okay. To really get that,

258
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,560
to speak a bit about the experience,

259
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,340
entrepreneurial experience

260
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,520
that I went through,

261
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,440
and it was actually somewhat unique

262
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,840
even for the Silicon Valley.

263
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,320
If you count from day one

264
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,560
to day exit, let's call it,

265
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:52,560
it was from 2000 to 2016 or 15,

266
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,720
so, it's about 15 or 16 years,

267
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,840
not a common path.

268
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,160
Wow.

269
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,160
And went to 9/11,

270
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,400
that well I should say,

271
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,280
from the .com bubble burst in 2000, 9/11,

272
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,040
and then later, the financial crisis.

273
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,920
So, three mega mega crisis

274
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,680
which caused changes, caused pivots

275
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,320
and still at the end resulted in actually

276
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,800
a very successful company.

277
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,040
But it wasn't without a scar

278
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,440
and it wasn't without tremendous

279
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,120
tremendous amount of work.

280
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,040
So, if there was one key lesson,

281
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,320
there's a few, but one key lesson is,

282
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,440
and that's something

283
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,320
you don't know necessarily at HBS.

284
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,120
[--]

285
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,680
many places in life is

286
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,000
if you're not in the game,

287
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,680
you can't win. Okay?

288
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,520
If you're not in the game,

289
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,200
you can't win.

290
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,680
So, you need to figure out

291
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,960
how do you stay in the game

292
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,280
despite everything.

293
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,760
Despite whatever is thrown at you,

294
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,720
you need to figure out

295
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,240
how to stay in the game.

296
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,960
And then you need to figure out

297
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,120
how to change and adapt

298
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,040
as the game and as the landscape change

299
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,800
so, you don't get stuck.

300
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,000
If you continue to be stuck

301
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,280
you would be outside.

302
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,080
But if you're in the game,

303
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,480
and if you're flexible enough

304
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,320
to adjust and pivot,

305
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,480
if you don't get panic

306
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,960
when the crisis are at you,

307
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,440
but actually you seize the opportunity

308
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,080
that they provide

309
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,960
and you're ready for the long term,

310
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,540
you'll get there.

311
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,160
I love it. Okay.

312
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,680
So, changing the landscapes.

313
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,000
You finished HBS.

314
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,640
Talked about, you move on

315
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,360
to create AtHoc, right?

316
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,600
AtHoc and ending up in BlackBerry.

317
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,680
Take me through this journey.

318
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,760
So, you start a company.

319
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,920
All of a sudden you're transitioning.

320
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,840
You're in security.

321
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,120
And you get to join this great company

322
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,280
that previously was a pioneer in mobile.

323
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,160
And you were just telling me that

324
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,120
that would be a lot of people

325
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,200
don't know is that,

326
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,640
there is a lot more to BlackBerry

327
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,840
than just mobile phones.

328
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,920
It's actually, it transitioned

329
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,200
into a software company.

330
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,120
And actually dealing with also,

331
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,800
a lot of automobiles, right?

332
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,200
So, the BlackBerry

333
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,920
is an amazing story by itself.

334
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,680
And we can probably speak

335
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,400
about this for a few hours.

336
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,560
It's exactly no there.

337
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,000
But it's a company that

338
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,600
was at its peak.

339
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,960
Was at the head of mobile

340
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,000
and was leading the world

341
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,840
leading mobile devices.

342
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,840
And frankly, missed the boat

343
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,520
when Apple came in with smartphones.

344
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,000
And as a result, collapsed.

345
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,840
And stayed in the field mainly,

346
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,520
because it had

347
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,880
its tremendous amount of money

348
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,480
but did not figure out about the people.

349
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,680
Until their current CEO came.

350
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,200
Which is a way before I joined

351
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,400
and decided,

352
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,960
Okay, let's pivot this company

353
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,280
to become a software business.

354
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,320
It is John Chen, right?

355
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,720
That's John Chen.

356
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,120
And John Chen did a great job

357
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,520
in really rescuing the business

358
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,700
because the rate it's going,

359
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,600
it's going outside.

360
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,480
A big part of what he did

361
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,360
it was acquisition.

362
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,480
He figured out that he needs

363
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,280
to bring in talent and assets

364
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,920
in order to make a transition

365
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,520
of this nature.

366
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,800
So, it's the technologies,

367
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,280
the customers, the people.

368
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,920
And that's why there was a big match

369
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,480
with what we brought in.

370
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,200
We were a company

371
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,720
that was dealing with communication,

372
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,760
with government contracts,

373
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,840
with the security, with finance,

374
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,240
financial services, etc,

375
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,250
all of the things that are actually

376
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,680
BlackBerry is looking for.

377
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,280
And that's how the merge came in.

378
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,160
And we basically were acquired and got in.

379
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,080
Now, from within, it's a different story.

380
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,920
It's a different story

381
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,080
because now, you're part of the team.

382
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,840
And I was in the executive team over there

383
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,000
trying to figure out

384
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,160
how to take this new vision,

385
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,760
which is not easy.

386
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,160
And transition this company

387
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,480
from a mobile device

388
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,840
with all of these assets that we acquired,

389
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,520
these assets, not a company

390
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,000
that I'm quite good with technologies

391
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,560
and a bunch of smaller companies

392
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,800
that were acquired a bit earlier on.

393
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,720
And get all of these entities together

394
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,560
to speak together

395
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,440
and really provide value.

396
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,640
And that was one of my task as a CSO,

397
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,080
is to figure out

398
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,200
and put some directioning on.

399
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,440
Now one of the things

400
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,800
that was fascinating is,

401
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,680
one of these assets

402
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,840
was a company called QNX.

403
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:10,560
Which was around secuity for cars.

404
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,960
And they provide software

405
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,040
that really provides that.

406
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,800
And in the world of security,

407
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,520
in the world of automated cars

408
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,760
and everything that we are seeing

409
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,880
in this market,

410
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,000
BlackBerry actually has a big play.

411
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,120
And another one of the key points

412
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,200
of the work that we've done at the time.

413
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,120
But still, it's a company in progress.

414
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,400
And BlackBerry's still needs to be proven.

415
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,660
To prove that it can take that next step.

416
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,640
Guy, these are these are things

417
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,760
that you really hear about

418
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,760
in university in case studies.

419
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,120
Companies that are coming.

420
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,440
Their market leaders.

421
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,440
And all of a sudden

422
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,120
they lose their footing.

423
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,160
And they have to figure out

424
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,280
how to either how to stay in the game.

425
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,200
And you got to play

426
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,560
the chief strategy officer

427
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,480
during that time of learning

428
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,720
how to stay in the game

429
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,320
and thinking about

430
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,880
how to make these acquisitions.

431
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,240
What are some of the challenges

432
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,120
that you're addressing here?

433
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,520
Are there different cultural challenges?

434
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,320
Or different adversities

435
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,000
that people don't know where we're headed?

436
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,080
Because people, I'm guessing,

437
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,040
are looking at you and saying,

438
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,000
"Hey, you're the chief strategy officer."

439
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,880
"What's our strategy?"

440
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,760
You're outlining what is the strategy

441
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,000
of BlackBerry to stay in the game?

442
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,040
So, it's actually quite fascinating

443
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,720
to that startup life

444
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,000
and turn around life,

445
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,780
and in Blackberry it was a turnaround,

446
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:33,040
are actually surprisingly similar.

447
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,520
And you will be thinking about

448
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,760
turning around a billion dollar business

449
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,760
and starting a young company

450
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,880
with zero funding is the same.

451
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,720
But there's a lot

452
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,520
of other similarities in it.

453
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,160
One, you need to figure out your story.

454
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,720
If you need to figure out your message.

455
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,760
And in a turnaround, it's a new message.

456
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,960
In the startup, It's a new message.

457
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,800
You need to keep focus.

458
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,320
It's not easy to keep focus.

459
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,120
Okay?

460
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,240
Even in a startup,

461
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,880
you can lose focus very quickly.

462
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,280
In a billion dollar business,

463
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,320
you can lose focus even faster.

464
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,640
Of course.

465
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,360
So, how do you craft your message.

466
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,200
How do you focus your business.

467
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,920
How do you get your technologies

468
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,240
and your people aligned.

469
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,440
The alignment of all the people,

470
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,040
all of the stakeholders around you.

471
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,760
In the startup, it's small.

472
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,920
In a billion dollar business,

473
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
it's many more.

474
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,720
Now, just for context

475
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,680
about how many people

476
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,720
are in the company around this time?

477
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,160
How many are we talking here?

478
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,840
5,000, give or take.

479
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,520
And it's a public company.

480
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,480
So, it's not just the employees.

481
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
It's the customers.

482
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,320
It's the partners.

483
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,480
And it's the investors.

484
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,480
And you're turning around the strategy

485
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,280
for a company of 5,000 employees.

486
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,240
It's not just about the company.

487
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,800
It's about maintaining alignment.

488
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,320
Now, the credit goes to John.

489
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,440
He's the CEO.

490
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,440
I'm not taking his credit in this respect.

491
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,320
But I get to talk

492
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,840
to the chief strategy officer now.

493
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,640
So, John, thank you very much.

494
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,350
But I'm learning from you at this moment.

495
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,520
So, you're representing

496
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,000
the executive team.

497
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,600
But that was a very fascinating process.

498
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,280
And again,

499
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,160
the similarities with the startup life

500
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,960
were fascinating.

501
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,760
And that's what the key message

502
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,640
in thinking about turnarounds

503
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,000
is exactly how to do that

504
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,360
and how to deal with such crisis changes.

505
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,200
I love it. Okay.

506
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,480
So, Guy, two successful endeavors.

507
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,440
An executive in a public company,

508
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,880
Harvard Business School.

509
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,760
You've probably achieved

510
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,320
every entrepreneur's dream.

511
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,080
Talk to me a little bit

512
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,960
about venture capital, Miasnik Ventures.

513
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,560
Why venture capital?

514
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,640
Why now?

515
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,760
What is your source?

516
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,160
Why now? Yeah.

517
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,040
First of all, it's not a venture capital.

518
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,800
Okay?

519
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,920
It's a different phase in my life now.

520
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,200
I've done three startups.

521
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,120
The business startups.

522
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,640
Not including the non-business startups.

523
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,600
And what I'm still fascinated by

524
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,720
is that early stage foundation

525
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,760
and incubations of businesses.

526
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,440
That's what drives me.

527
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,440
Because that's the time

528
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,120
where you can shape, you can direct,

529
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,880
you can really figure out

530
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,600
and create something

531
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,800
that is completely new.

532
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,080
So, that's what I do right now.

533
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,080
I really work

534
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,600
with very early stage entrepreneurs.

535
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,680
Sometimes, it could be a professor

536
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,480
that he has some ideas

537
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,520
and wants to figure out

538
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,200
how to commercialize it

539
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:16,880
to some class.

540
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,080
And other case could be

541
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,320
an executive that wants to get out

542
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,960
and figure out where to go.

543
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,600
Sometimes only an existing team

544
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,040
that may have some initial funding

545
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,800
and wants to figure out

546
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,240
how to take the next step.

547
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,400
And I joined them.

548
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,800
I joined them in some capacity.

549
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,680
Typically, it's a bit of an investment

550
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,920
and advisory board position.

551
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,200
But it's a very executive position.

552
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,800
Meaning, I spend a lot of time.

553
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,240
I work, I try to really make sure

554
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,920
that they don't make my mistakes.

555
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,200
Let them create their own mistakes

556
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,320
but don't make my mistakes

557
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,920
and learn from that experience.

558
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,000
And at the end, I'm looking for,

559
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,160
is number one, is amazing people.

560
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,480
That's for me, the number one criteria

561
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,880
in every one of these decisions

562
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,560
and endeavors.

563
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,280
And obviously,

564
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,640
it needs to be a fascinating market.

565
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,520
The field, you want to be in the field,

566
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,640
you better enjoy the field

567
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,040
[--]

568
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,440
I'm always looking for things

569
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,400
that have an impact.

570
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,920
And have some social impact.

571
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,640
And I've been working in public safety.

572
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,840
I've been working in security.

573
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,520
I've been working in healthcare,

574
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,920
education, it's areas

575
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,840
where you can actually feel

576
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
and sense the impact

577
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,160
of what you're creating.

578
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,320
And also sectors that attract

579
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,400
certain types of people.

580
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,800
And I'm not talking about

581
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,000
necessarily just the founders,

582
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,040
but the entire ecosystem around it.

583
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,960
Remember that when we, in our talk

584
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,040
which was at the end

585
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,080
the public safety company

586
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,480
and got about 200 people,

587
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,920
we had amazing guys.

588
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,480
We have people who are ex-militarily,

589
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,800
ex-firefighters, people who came

590
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,920
from emergency management of counties

591
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,520
People that were

592
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,240
really living the mission.

593
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,320
And that's the passion and the mission

594
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,160
is a very crucial part of this.

595
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,920
Very very cool.

596
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,600
So, you're saying

597
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,240
working with entrepreneurs.

598
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,320
Working with them

599
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,280
as almost joining their team.

600
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,960
But when we started the conversation,

601
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,240
the first thing you mentioned was that,

602
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,360
when you're an entrepreneur,

603
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,560
is you are guided by emotions

604
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,120
and this urge to do something

605
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,640
that doesn't exist.

606
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,280
A lot of people say

607
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,080
that entrepreneurs have to be crazy.

608
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,600
So, it must be frustrating sometimes

609
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,960
when you're working with entrepreneurs,

610
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,640
you've made the same mistakes

611
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,800
they're about to make.

612
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,760
You know they're going to make

613
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,280
this mistake.

614
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,680
But entrepreneurs are guided

615
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,520
by emotion sometimes.

616
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,520
And I'm sure that sometimes,

617
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,520
they don't listen.

618
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,840
Sometimes they need to make that mistake.

619
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,920
Is that frustrating to you?

620
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,960
Or do you say,

621
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,720
Okay. I'm going to let them

622
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,440
make this mistake?

623
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,360
So, you know what?

624
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,520
I have three kids.

625
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,000
One of them is now 21 years old.

626
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,400
He has his own startup.

627
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,200
Yeah.

628
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,600
And so, when you raise kids,

629
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,000
you go through the same thing.

630
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,040
You see what they do.

631
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,160
You try to give them

632
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,720
your best advice and wisdom.

633
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,720
And hopefully most of the time,

634
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,200
they'll listen.

635
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,760
Sometimes they don't listen.

636
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,200
Hopefully most of the time you're correct.

637
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,280
But sometimes you're not correct as well.

638
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,360
So, it's a matter of really the team

639
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,640
and the people that you work with.

640
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,880
And to find ones

641
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,480
that can have a mutual respect.

642
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,800
But also, remember something

643
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,480
really important.

644
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,160
At the end, it's their startup.

645
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,640
Okay? It's not you.

646
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,360
If you are joining, in this case, it's me.

647
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,440
If I'm joining and I'm supporting them.

648
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,280
Still supporting them

649
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,040
but they are the founders.

650
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,050
They are the entrepreneurs.

651
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:37,080
They are the guys that are in the trenches

652
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,440
and will go and make that happen.

653
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,960
So, we always have to remember that.

654
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,040
I love it. I love it.

655
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,720
And I'm learning so much

656
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,360
through our work together in J-Ventures.

657
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,720
And just, I think that your passion

658
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,680
for helping entrepreneurs

659
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,000
just shines through this.

660
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,840
And I look forward

661
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,200
to working together much more.

662
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,560
And I had a wonderful chat

663
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,600
with your son the other day.

664
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,960
And I was just so impressed

665
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,920
and so taken back

666
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,960
that he was really doing

667
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,680
incredible things.

668
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,880
And now I understand

669
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,080
the mentorship that he gets.

670
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,200
But Guy, before we leave,

671
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,840
I have to ask for three words

672
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,240
that you would use to describe yourself.

673
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:07,880
Got it. Okay.

674
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,480
You give me a few minutes

675
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,120
heads up on this one.

676
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,560
But we were speaking throughout.

677
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,800
I didn't have too much time to think.

678
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,760
So, when I tell you

679
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,120
that you have 90 minutes to prepare,

680
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,920
it's actually a lie.

681
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,600
Because you have to answer me

682
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,200
for these 19 minutes.

683
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,960
So, I would say, one, is passion.

684
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,560
Passion in whatever you do.

685
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,000
And enjoy whatever you do.

686
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,400
Number two, is persistency.

687
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,200
I spoke about it. Just be there.

688
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,120
Be there and play the game.

689
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,920
Play the game and stay in the game.

690
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,000
And number three, it's family.

691
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,400
And family is obviously

692
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,680
your own immediate family.

693
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,040
But family is also the team

694
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,760
that you create you build in your startup.

695
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,520
And the ecosystem you build around it.

696
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,080
And if you treat them as a family,

697
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,570
it is the thing, they become your family.

698
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,600
And that's the perfect startup.

699
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,720
Guy, toda raba.

700
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,160
Thank you very very much.

701
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,080
Thank you for the time.

702
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,560
Thank you for the inspiration.

703
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,680
And then I'll see you around

704
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,680
in our monthly meetings.

705
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,440
Michael, thank you very much.

706
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,760
Take care.

707
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,000
Bye bye.
