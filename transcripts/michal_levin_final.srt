1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,760
This is something

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,840
that technology cannot solve on its own.

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,120
You have to had much more empathy

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,880
and compassion and insight

5
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,160
into the human psychology.

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,280
Really understanding

7
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,920
the emotional barriers

8
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,720
that go into people like,

9
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,560
having difficulty

10
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,520
to change their behavior.

11
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,840
And what are the mechanics

12
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,000
that you can build into that.

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,440
Michal Levin, thank you

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,840
for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders.

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,280
How are you?

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,680
I'm great, how are you?

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,160
Happy holidays.

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,920
Happy holidays to you, too.

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,520
I'm so excited to talk about

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,000
user experience with you.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,120
Like I mentioned,

22
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,400
I didn't get to talk to it

23
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,360
about nearly enough

24
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,000
in the 300 episodes we've had.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,640
And I'm super excited to dig deep

26
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,080
into the importance of user experience

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,120
and in everything we do,

28
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,800
both in tech and startups,

29
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,480
but in daily life as well.

30
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,720
And before we get started,

31
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,280
I have to say

32
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,440
your experience with UX is remarkable.

33
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,920
I think that I saw

34
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,880
about a dozen different organizations

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,960
that you've made an impact

36
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,240
on in the world of UX

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,000
all the way from a startup like Zoox

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,200
to a Google, to Verily, and now Hero.

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,880
So, tell me a little bit about

40
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,600
your journey.

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,000
How do you even get started

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,200
with dealing with user experience?

43
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,680
Yeah. That's a great question.

44
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,200
Those are quite a few years back.

45
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,440
Actually, the story starts back in Israel

46
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,920
where I was born and raised.

47
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,320
And after I finished my army service,

48
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,960
I actually join a company.

49
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,640
And that's kind of like

50
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,440
was my entry to the tech industry.

51
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,760
And I actually, join as a QA.

52
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,240
And I started working there.

53
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,720
And back in the days it was about,

54
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,800
what, probably,

55
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,680
about 15 to 20 years ago,

56
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,105
UX in Israel wasn't an industry.

57
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:04,800
Like there was no education around

58
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,920
and there were not

59
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,440
a lot of companies that was doing that.

60
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,720
It was just like early on

61
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,680
where mostly engineers were just like

62
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,880
building the UI's based on what they

63
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,200
thought was the right thing to do.

64
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,520
And I actually remember those early days

65
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,760
where I was doing QA

66
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,600
and I was testing

67
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,920
the functionality of the product.

68
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,960
But I kind of started also asking,

69
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,440
just like intuitively all this question

70
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,480
as to why, you know,

71
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,880
why do we have all these menu items,

72
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,960
like why does the workflow

73
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,400
work like this.

74
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,880
And I started just like

75
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,680
within the culture of that company.

76
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,080
We started talking about this idea

77
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,720
of usability and UI super early on.

78
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,560
So, that's kind of like

79
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,800
was the early, early seeds.

80
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,760
Then I actually went to a school

81
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,280
and I started Computer Science

82
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,280
and Business Management.

83
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,040
However, halfway through my degree

84
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,840
actually decided that computer science

85
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,360
is not what I want to continue doing.

86
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,760
I didn't see myself just like,

87
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,560
you know, exiting and coding.

88
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,440
I really wanted to see

89
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,920
how I can bring more people

90
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,200
to focus creative doing

91
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,680
into kind of like what I do in my career.

92
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,781
So, I paused.

93
00:03:04,782 --> 00:03:06,560
I started exploring,

94
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,120
kind of like what I want to do next.

95
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,200
And I ended up actually

96
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,600
going on to multiple route of psychology

97
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,680
and communication as one bachelor degree.

98
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,920
And I also continued

99
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,120
my business management

100
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,120
as a parallel path.

101
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,760
And I continued

102
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,960
with these two bachelor degrees.

103
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,960
And I really enjoyed it.

104
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,720
But then kind of like as I was studying,

105
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,320
I was like, okay,

106
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,040
what am I going to do

107
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,000
with all these degrees,

108
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,640
like, what does that translate to.

109
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,080
And while I was in school,

110
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,215
I kind of like went back to this like,

111
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,200
oh, you know, there was this UX thing

112
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,200
that I kind of like started back then

113
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,040
and I think super interesting.

114
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,200
And it made me feel like

115
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,847
this could be something that I'm good at

116
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:46,000
that really brings together

117
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,320
this like the cognitive psychology

118
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,080
with technology.

119
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,040
So honestly, what I ended up doing

120
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,000
is one evening,

121
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,240
I just opened Google

122
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,720
and I just search for all

123
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,240
the UX companies in Israel

124
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,640
and I just applied to all of them.

125
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,160
I wrote a cover letter explaining

126
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,600
why I think bring I value to that company.

127
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,760
And I just like throw it out there.

128
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,080
A couple of companies got back to me.

129
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,560
I got an interview process

130
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,440
and luckily enough, I landed in TZUR,

131
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,320
which was kind of like

132
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,560
one of the top design agencies in Israel.

133
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,360
And that was actually my entry point.

134
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,280
So, you go into an agency,

135
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,800
it's just like all about,

136
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,840
like having a lot of UX people there.

137
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,760
I worked there for almost four years

138
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,200
and I think I built a lot of

139
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,680
just like hands on experience

140
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,840
and understanding,

141
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,080
working with dozens and dozens of clients

142
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,000
across so many different platforms,

143
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,400
you know, mobile and web

144
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,480
and TV and across

145
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,760
like media and finance and gaming.

146
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,560
And that gave me, like,

147
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,440
so much experience with that.

148
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,000
So, yeah.

149
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So, that kind of like how I started.

150
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,440
From there,

151
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,120
I actually joined Modu,

152
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,040
which was founded by Dov Moran,

153
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,480
one of the top entrepreneurs in Israel.

154
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,160
And during my work at Modu,

155
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,920
actually nine months into my work there,

156
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,720
I was approached by Google.

157
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,720
And a funny story was that I had a doubt

158
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,880
like I don't want to pursue that.

159
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,280
Like I was very happy at Modu.

160
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,280
And then a friend of mine said like,

161
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,440
"What are you saying?

162
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,280
Are you crazy?

163
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,000
You know, get started,

164
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,200
go through the hiring process.

165
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,160
You can always say no at the end."

166
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,395
So, I started.

167
00:05:24,396 --> 00:05:25,760
And it ended up

168
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,960
being a really long process.

169
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,440
It was about

170
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,000
seven months of hiring process

171
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,640
because it was

172
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,840
the first UX hire in UX Israel.

173
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,080
So, I had like, 14 interviews

174
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,690
across, like around the world,

175
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:39,360
on [--].

176
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,200
Yeah.

177
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,040
But during that time,

178
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,280
seven months of interviewing,

179
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,360
you start getting excited

180
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,600
about the opportunity.

181
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,720
And it feels kind of like this

182
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,720
psychological connection

183
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,720
and I ended up getting hired.

184
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,320
And this is how

185
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,600
I started my Google journey,

186
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,039
which really kind of like a company

187
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,400
in over the following decade.

188
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,760
I spent six and a half years with Google.

189
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,680
I moved to the US,

190
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,080
through Google.

191
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,680
I worked at Verily,

192
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,680
and now I'm at Hero.

193
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,560
Unbelievable.

194
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,160
I have to give the analogy.

195
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,480
I never wanted to be a pilot.

196
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,440
My father was a pilot.

197
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,680
And when it came down to going

198
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,560
to do the army testing

199
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,920
which we do in Israel,

200
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,040
of course, you know, I said, okay.

201
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,600
You know, they're inviting me to try.

202
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,840
I knew that I didn't want to be a pilot.

203
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,120
And but all my friends said,

204
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,240
"Well, Michael, you have to try.

205
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,280
Like, you know, it's like,

206
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,200
you have to see if you can make it."

207
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,400
And I remember they sent me

208
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,560
to the [--]. It was one

209
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,280
of the worst weeks of my life.

210
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,880
And I'm traumatized by it until today

211
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,120
because it was so difficult.

212
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,320
By the end of it when I was accepted,

213
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,640
it was so hard to say no.

214
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,040
Even though I didn't want to be a pilot,

215
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,280
I felt like I just had to do it

216
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,520
because I got through it.

217
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,600
As if it does mean to myself.

218
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,000
But I have to give that analogy,

219
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,338
And I think you set it on.

220
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:51,720
You said that they hired you

221
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,960
now, you said yes.

222
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,720
That's what I think it's,

223
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,600
it more comes down to,

224
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,480
from what I'm gathering from the story.

225
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,270
Michal, break it down for me.

226
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:00,320
User experience.

227
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,440
You mentioned the psychology,

228
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,000
communication, computer science,

229
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,360
disintegration of

230
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,360
understanding user behavior.

231
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,520
Break it down for me.

232
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,920
What is user experience

233
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,315
and why is it so fascinating to you?

234
00:07:11,316 --> 00:07:15,040
Yeah. That's a good question.

235
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,200
I think, at the end of the day, you know,

236
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,120
it's kind of like it's starting

237
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,622
with understanding

238
00:07:20,623 --> 00:07:22,040
why are we doing these things, you know.

239
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,080
You start with the why.

240
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,920
I think that's going to, like

241
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,800
one title commonly associated

242
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,520
with Simon Sinek,

243
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,440
I think I kind of like very much

244
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,000
relate to that.

245
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,640
It's really like starting to think about

246
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
what you're doing

247
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,600
and what you're building

248
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,640
by truly understanding what people need,

249
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,760
what are their pain points,

250
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:40,932
what are their mental models,

251
00:07:40,933 --> 00:07:41,960
behavior weaknesses,

252
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,160
where the psychology really kind of like

253
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,320
going deep into understanding

254
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,040
what is the problem

255
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,240
that you're trying to solve,

256
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,400
what are the common barriers,

257
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,280
what are the pain points.

258
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,040
And really starting from

259
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,120
their needs and goals,

260
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,320
doing that analysis

261
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,560
really understanding the people

262
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,440
and the audiences that you are trying to

263
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,680
to solve the problem for,

264
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,760
and go from there.

265
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,080
So, it's not about starting

266
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,960
with the technology

267
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,560
and everything we can do because

268
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,600
the technology can do X and can do Y,

269
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,320
which is what we call

270
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,480
a tech driven approach.

271
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,360
It's a user centered approach.

272
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,040
Like, let's understand,

273
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,760
what do people even need

274
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,320
and then see what is the best way

275
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:18,840
to do that.

276
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,720
And again, it doesn't mean

277
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,240
that we necessarily need to do

278
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,200
all the fancy stuff.

279
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,680
We really need to hone in

280
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,800
on what are the key needs.

281
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,120
I think a good example for that

282
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,080
and for that kind of like

283
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,160
how it manifests itself,

284
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,840
i actually think the last couple of years

285
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,920
working in healthcare

286
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,480
is a really great example.

287
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,040
Michal, new background,

288
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,400
new environment, same user experience,

289
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,800
same question.

290
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,400
Talking about health care a little bit

291
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,120
from your experience as well.

292
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,200
Why is your expertise

293
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,120
with health care an interesting example

294
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,080
of the importance of user experience?

295
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,560
Yeah, I think it's a really great example

296
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,360
of the difference between

297
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,280
technology focused approach

298
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,400
and user centered approach.

299
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,240
Because, you know,

300
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:05,240
there's a lot of promising technologies

301
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,360
and things that we can do.

302
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,680
Machine learning and AI,

303
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,400
and we can build all these amazing tools

304
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,880
and do sophisticated things.

305
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,480
But when you actually try to innovate

306
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,760
within healthcare,

307
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,400
what you realize that oftentimes

308
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,000
when you try to build tools

309
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,440
for like health systems physicians,

310
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,680
the secret and what would actually

311
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,080
get you to change

312
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,000
and move the needle

313
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,760
is how well you can integrate

314
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,720
into their existing workflows.

315
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,920
So, if you stop building

316
00:09:32,921 --> 00:09:34,480
all these amazing tools,

317
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,000
but they're actually a separate tool

318
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,240
that they need to log into that,

319
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,040
they need to open it,

320
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,200
they need to learn.

321
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,400
that is a huge barrier for adaption.

322
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,360
And oftentimes innovation would come

323
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,600
by like finding the ways

324
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,680
that you can integrate into their EHR.

325
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,320
And even if the EHR UX is not great,

326
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,640
this is where they're at.

327
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,640
And you need to find the creative ways

328
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,160
of integrating yourself there,

329
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,560
and being in it as part of the workflows

330
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,280
and seeing how through there

331
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,040
you can bring value to them.

332
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,600
So, oftentimes it's not necessarily,

333
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,880
like all the amazing,

334
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,840
beautiful technology

335
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,680
that we can build independently

336
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,440
is really finding their way

337
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,520
to tapping your cells

338
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,880
into their busy schedule

339
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,960
and really understanding

340
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,640
that they have like,

341
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,760
five minutes a day

342
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,840
to take a look at these things.

343
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,160
And if you want to squeeze yourself

344
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,120
within their daily routine,

345
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,320
it's not going to be

346
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,040
with building a whole other tool

347
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,600
outside of their kind of like habits.

348
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,480
I think that's a fascinating example.

349
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,680
Because, you know,

350
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,280
it's the entrepreneurial mindset of any,

351
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,440
especially young entrepreneur is saying,

352
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,280
Okay, we have this idea and

353
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,480
we want to make it all around

354
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,280
beautiful products

355
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,480
that are all login screen

356
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,000
and are all user experience.

357
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,480
And we're so excited to show this

358
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,440
on encompassing product when

359
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,200
if we forget a little bit about

360
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,480
the customer that at the that

361
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,520
needs to use the product

362
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,880
and what their behavior is

363
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,680
and how are we fitting

364
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,480
into their behavior,

365
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,120
then we might have

366
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,760
this crazy misalignments

367
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,520
where nobody

368
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,611
can even use your product

369
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:56,920
because you're not aligning

370
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,640
to what they actually need.

371
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,680
Why isn't the engineer in the room

372
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,960
or the project manager in the room

373
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,720
enough to understand this?

374
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,920
Why is there

375
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,960
a specific role called user experience

376
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,480
Why is there this function

377
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,280
within a company?

378
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,360
Why isn't it enough that engineers

379
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,240
just think critically

380
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,280
about their customers

381
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,080
and just adapt to that?

382
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,480
Yeah. It's a great question,.

383
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,800
And I would start by saying that again,

384
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,560
like the culture that

385
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,680
I've been raised on

386
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,280
and I truly believe in.

387
00:11:28,281 --> 00:11:30,560
It's not like that the UX person

388
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,240
is the only one

389
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,480
that solves all the problems.

390
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,400
I think it's like continuously

391
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,840
collaborative process

392
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,760
where we work together,

393
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,440
engineering and product

394
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,103
and UX bringing

395
00:11:39,104 --> 00:11:40,600
all the considerations together,

396
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,280
thinking through user problems.

397
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,160
I think it's important

398
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,200
across the organization,

399
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,560
whether you're a product manager,

400
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,880
engineer, regulatory person,

401
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,800
to have a shared understanding

402
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,880
of what are we building,

403
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,720
why we're building,

404
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,760
who are our user.

405
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,120
So, I think this is actually something

406
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,680
that culturally we need to be shared.

407
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,480
I think in terms of like

408
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,080
when do we need it

409
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,200
like, why do we need a dedicated role?

410
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,560
I think it's just that

411
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,520
a full time job to do that work well.

412
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,360
And at the end of the day,

413
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,160
it's just like any role.

414
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,565
Like, why do we need PGMs?

415
00:12:10,566 --> 00:12:12,079
Like, can't a PM be a PGM?

416
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,880
In some scenarios, yes.

417
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,800
Like, people can build that skillset.

418
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,920
I think it's just like

419
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,600
at the end of the day,

420
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,560
like, you have a limited bandwidth,

421
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,760
there's work to be done.

422
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,480
And if you want to do it well,

423
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,040
you need dedicated resources

424
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,480
that can have the bandwidth to do it.

425
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:26,681
So, if a PM needs to,

426
00:12:26,683 --> 00:12:28,199
like a PM can also code.

427
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,040
Why not them the engineers?

428
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,621
Well, because if they need to have to code,

429
00:12:32,622 --> 00:12:33,303
they going to need to spend

430
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:34,040
half the day on it

431
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,080
so, they don't have the time

432
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,720
to collect the business requirements

433
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,320
and do like landscape analysis

434
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,720
and talk to customers.

435
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,280
So, I don't think it's necessarily

436
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,600
like people that have

437
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,240
like a specific super power

438
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,040
that others cannot learn or gain.

439
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,520
It's more about how do you build

440
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,720
a healthy organization

441
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,400
where you put your resources

442
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,600
on the key things that have to be,

443
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,480
you know, super thoughtful,

444
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,680
go deep and truly understand,

445
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,000
so, we do build the best product.

446
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I think that's fascinating.

447
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,600
And one of the things that

448
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,725
I'm always asking myself\

449
00:13:04,726 --> 00:13:07,080
in the context of user experience is

450
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,120
the way that I think

451
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,960
about user experience

452
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,520
to some degree is thinking, okay,

453
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,640
we have this intuition about

454
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,000
how we should approach

455
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,800
solving the problem for our users.

456
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,120
And user experience professionals

457
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,960
can help us navigate that intuition

458
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,760
into practicality and research data

459
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,840
driven analysis of what actually

460
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,680
do our users needed,

461
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,200
how do actually can we

462
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,120
use our intuition to navigate there.

463
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,680
And one of the things

464
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,520
that I'm always asking myself is

465
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,240
how do you even know

466
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,480
that there's a problem.

467
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:33,680
Right?

468
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,320
How do you know that

469
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,160
if I have a hundred functions

470
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,240
within a company

471
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,080
and I'm guessing

472
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,640
within Google and Verily,

473
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,240
in those different companies

474
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,760
you've been a part of,

475
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,080
there were many, many aspects

476
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,880
where user experience was important.

477
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,120
How can the CEO,

478
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,680
the engineer or the product manager,

479
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,960
even pinpoint the parts where

480
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,760
a user experience professional

481
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,840
may be of use?

482
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,840
Yeah. Well,

483
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,880
i think kind of like as you said,

484
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,720
it starts with like research

485
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,520
and really understanding

486
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,560
what we're trying to solve.

487
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,920
So, I think every entrepreneur,

488
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,400
every CEO, every product manager,

489
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,680
they usually start their initiative

490
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,960
by observing a problem.

491
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,640
By observing an unsolved need

492
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,033
or a need that is not

493
00:14:18,034 --> 00:14:19,360
being solved well enough.

494
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,440
And then in order for you

495
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,080
to tackle differently,

496
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,440
so, you sometimes

497
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,120
if you went to this personally,

498
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,800
you already have some insights around

499
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,440
what you experience is being

500
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,600
like the key barriers or the key gaps.

501
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,160
If you're trying now to say, okay,

502
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,120
how do we build

503
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,000
a scaled product out of that,

504
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,760
you need to do kind of go deeper to say,

505
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,400
how much is your experience

506
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,120
actually applicable more broadly.

507
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,920
You want to understand

508
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,240
what are the target audience

509
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,000
that apply to that.

510
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,520
And there's a lot of research

511
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,160
that needs to go

512
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,920
into understanding more deeply

513
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,520
what does that intake.

514
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,280
So, again, like,

515
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,760
where are the problem's coming from,

516
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,040
what are people's expectations.

517
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,200
As well as, you know,

518
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,366
in an ongoing way,

519
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:01,120
as you develop the product,

520
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,040
whether it's based on your intuitions

521
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,720
and kind of like your ideas,

522
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,840
you want to validate that.

523
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,000
And again, you need people that

524
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,120
can go and thoughtfully do that.

525
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,600
So, you know,

526
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,720
there's like different approaches.

527
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,960
Often times people just think

528
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,440
that they can go to people and say,

529
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,800
Would you like this feature?

530
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,320
Would you find this feature useful?

531
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,160
Which, again, kind of like

532
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,850
for a lot of people,

533
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:18,920
it feels like intuitive to do.

534
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,920
But that actually doesn't generate

535
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,160
and like any viable results.

536
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:25,360
Because whenever you ask anybody

537
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,600
if they want this or that,

538
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,960
they will usually say yes.

539
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,760
Because why not

540
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,600
if they can get more.

541
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,113
But there's a lot more that goes into it

542
00:15:32,114 --> 00:15:33,582
because what you end up seeing

543
00:15:33,782 --> 00:15:35,600
that people use maybe 10% of the features

544
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,240
that you offer them,

545
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,120
because at the end of the day,

546
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,360
would they actually use the product.

547
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,320
Then there's trade offs

548
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,360
whether in terms of complexity and time

549
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,840
and all those things,

550
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,720
they're not going to use it.

551
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,154
So, you do need to have

552
00:15:45,155 --> 00:15:47,760
particular skills to do the research well.

553
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,698
So, you gain the right insight

554
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,120
that you can rely on.

555
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,520
Also, you really want to have,

556
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,200
kind of like, holistic approach

557
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,600
to look at qualitative data

558
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,400
and quantitative data.

559
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,080
And again,

560
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,040
doing all of that, it takes time,

561
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,360
requires expertise.

562
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,320
Also, how do you design things well.

563
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,240
Like how the whole

564
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,640
there's a whole, like, investment now.

565
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,160
And this is an area that I'm also like,

566
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,640
super excited about is like

567
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,920
this whole idea of behavior change.

568
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,240
And I think that's another angle

569
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,200
that to me represents how important UX is.

570
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,480
Because we see it again in healthcare

571
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,400
but everywhere.

572
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,960
You can build all the most

573
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,480
amazing devices,

574
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,958
whether it's wearables

575
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:28,040
or like all of the crazy stuff

576
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,320
that we see that is amazing.

577
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,840
But between having an amazing device

578
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,840
and getting people to use it every day,

579
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,560
there is a big, big gap.

580
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:36,800
Right?

581
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,760
This is why we see that like obesity

582
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,200
is like more prevalent than ever.

583
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:41,640
And like changing behavior

584
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,419
of the people is so so hard.

585
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,880
I think this is where,

586
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,520
this is something

587
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,440
that technology cannot solve on its own.

588
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,920
Like, you have to have much more empathy

589
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,640
and compassion and insight

590
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,920
into the human psychology,

591
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,720
really understanding

592
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,680
the emotional barriers

593
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,520
that go into people kind of like

594
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,720
having difficulty to change

595
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,280
their behavior

596
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,600
and what are the mechanics

597
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,200
that you can build into that.

598
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,440
So to me, that's another area

599
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,280
where I see healthcare

600
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,280
like UX is critical.

601
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,835
To really change

602
00:17:08,836 --> 00:17:09,840
people behavior and scale,

603
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,000
it's still an unresolved problem.

604
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,120
UX is critical.

605
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,560
And I think this is what I see

606
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,040
a lot of the value that comes

607
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,560
by really going deep on these areas.

608
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,600
It's fascinating beyond belief.

609
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,560
I just read a really interesting article

610
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,520
by one of my former bosses,

611
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,240
Kristen Berman from the Irrational Lab.

612
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,080
One of Dan Ariely's projects.

613
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,720
And he was talking about the vaccine.

614
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,120
Like thinking about the covid-19 vaccine

615
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,400
and the user experience behind

616
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,440
that whole distribution.

617
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,960
And now, we were in this situation

618
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,189
where we need

619
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,568
like 75% of the world

620
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:50,680
to take this shot voluntarily

621
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,240
in order to resolve this pandemic.

622
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,460
And it's fascinating, I think.

623
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:55,120
Thinking of behavioral economics and help.

624
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,640
And you see prime ministers

625
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,680
going on live television

626
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,280
doing it themselves.

627
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:58,800
Like that's a part

628
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,040
of the user experience journey.

629
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,640
Right?

630
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,040
And I'm really wondering, sometimes,

631
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,880
how much thought really is put

632
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,480
into these critical, critical things.

633
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,600
I have a hunch that it's not enough.

634
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,680
And we need more people like you to help

635
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,280
advise these [--].

636
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,320
But that's fascinating.

637
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,560
Michal, we don't have much time.

638
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,480
But give me a few key insight nuggets

639
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,160
for the young entrepreneur

640
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,760
of how to approach

641
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,000
solving user experience issues

642
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,440
or intuitions as they build a company,

643
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,080
whether it's for B2B or B2C,

644
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,200
doesn't really matter.

645
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,800
Yeah. That could be a topic

646
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,840
for an entire conversation.

647
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,720
I think I would go back to kind of like

648
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,822
where I started.

649
00:18:41,823 --> 00:18:43,200
It starts with why.

650
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,680
And I think this is also,

651
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,560
when I interview UX people,

652
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,840
when I look for UX people,

653
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,920
I start with looking

654
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,960
at their critical thinking

655
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,280
and their problem solving skills

656
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,200
before the visual aesthetic

657
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
and the ability to design a screen well.

658
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,080
You really want

659
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,360
to have people that keep asking why.

660
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,400
Really understanding like,

661
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,480
why are we doing that,

662
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,880
why are we doing it this way,

663
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,080
can we simplify it.

664
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,200
Like really keep asking this why.

665
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,520
And it's pretty interesting.

666
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,600
I have two toddlers

667
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,280
and I think those behaviors,

668
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,360
they ask why like 10 times on everything.

669
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:16,960
They go, but why, but why, but why.

670
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,400
And you know, as a parent

671
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,200
it would sometimes be challenging.

672
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,040
But I think that's the right mindset.

673
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,320
And I think over time along the way,

674
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
we start asking those deep whys.

675
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,720
But I think that those whys

676
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,800
and going like three whys in,

677
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,000
you know, the first principle approach.

678
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:32,840
Really understanding

679
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,240
why we need a certain things

680
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,760
and how can we do it better.

681
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,280
I think this is where innovation

682
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,800
starts from.

683
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,720
So, that would be kind of like

684
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,840
my top advice in terms of the mindset.

685
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,280
Because I think

686
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,800
it starts with the mindset.

687
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,160
And the more you ask those why,

688
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
I think this is where you start thinking

689
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,080
about things differently.

690
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,400
The other thing I would say

691
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,840
is what I think like personal experience

692
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,160
is many times provides good intuition

693
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,920
as to where we need to go.

694
00:20:00,921 --> 00:20:02,320
We do need to remind ourselves

695
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,200
that you are not the user in most cases.

696
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,680
So, we need to be humble,

697
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,520
we need to make sure

698
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,560
that we're not making

699
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,160
too strong assumptions based on

700
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,000
our own experience

701
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,560
and take the time to truly try

702
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,400
and understand the audience

703
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,200
that we are targeting

704
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,480
and where they are coming from

705
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,680
and what are their challenges

706
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,080
and making sure that we have the empathy

707
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,960
and we really incorporate that into

708
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,360
how we approach the product

709
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,800
and we validate and we learn.

710
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
Because those things are changing

711
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,840
all the time.

712
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,760
So, yeah.

713
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,160
I think that's just inspiring.

714
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,680
So, thank you, Michal, for that.

715
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,434
Three words that you would use

716
00:20:34,435 --> 00:20:35,720
to describe yourself.

717
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,720
My favorite question.

718
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,240
Okay. So, three words.

719
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,480
I'm probably going to,

720
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,520
I'm going to cheat a little bit

721
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,160
because I'm going to use

722
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,800
the two words for each one.

723
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,640
But there is a hyphen there

724
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,240
so, theoretically speaking, it's one.

725
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,280
I think one thing about myself that

726
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,880
characterizes me, I think,

727
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,760
in everything that I do

728
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,920
and also my career is

729
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,240
just like people-focused.

730
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,840
I think it all starts with the people.

731
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,960
Hiring the right people,

732
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,280
building the right relationships,

733
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,640
being really people focusing,

734
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,880
kind of like what people need,

735
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,280
how you can grow them,

736
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,200
how do we work with them as peers.

737
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,520
That's going to be one.

738
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,680
The second is growth-minded.

739
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,760
I think constantly,

740
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,040
like I seek feedback, I seek growth.

741
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,840
I want to grow as an individual.

742
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,240
I want to grow as a professional.

743
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,600
I am a big believer

744
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,200
in the approach of atomic habits.

745
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,400
Get 1% better every day.

746
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,440
And so I really do seek

747
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,160
those avenues of growth constantly.

748
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,640
And the last thing I would say

749
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,920
is daring-greatly.

750
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,480
Which is a concept

751
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,760
that has kind of become more popular

752
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,739
with Brené Brown books,

753
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,960
which I absolutely admire.

754
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,320
I think she is she's brilliant

755
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,920
and she like the type of messages

756
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,720
that she's trying

757
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,200
to kind of like disseminate

758
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,880
are so important on vulnerability

759
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,680
and imperfection.

760
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,760
But to me, that's kind of like

761
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,000
this idea of like being in the arena,

762
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,080
fighting, putting in the blood and sweat

763
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,240
and failing and overcoming obstacles

764
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,960
until kind of like you ideally succeed,

765
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,480
but really kind of like not just critique

766
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,040
and point from the side

767
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,040
of what's not working.

768
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,120
But really being there and trying

769
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,160
and working hard for worthy outcomes

770
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,160
and do your best.

771
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,000
I just love that.

772
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,560
Michal, thank you so, so much.

773
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,800
This was wonderful.

774
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,600
I appreciate your time so much.

775
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,760
I know how busy you are.

776
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,080
And all I can say

777
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,560
is stay safe and stay healthy.

778
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,880
And thank you for the amazing

779
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,717
work that you're doing.

780
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:32,718
Thank you.
