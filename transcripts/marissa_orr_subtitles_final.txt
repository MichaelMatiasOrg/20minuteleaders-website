1 Marissa Orr, thank you for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. How are you? Thank you for having me. I'm doing well today, thanks. Looking forward to our chat. I'm extremely excited for our chat, because I love the episodes where I get to just hear people's journey and hear about the different twists and turns they took to their non-linear career pathways, yet it somehow ends up with a very optimistic note of passion and curiosity, which I think is going to happen here as well. So Marissa, tell me a little bit about your both experience as a business executive in top companies but also now as a business owner. Yeah. So, I started working at Google back in 2003 and that was before the company had gone public. I was working in New York City. I graduated college or grad school not too early, not too long before then. And I actually got the Google interview through this old Yahoo jobs board called HotJobs which people your age wouldn't know about, but anybody my age remembers it very well. There was about 50 people in the New York office at Google at the time. Now there's maybe 10,000, so it was a very different place. I really got to grow up there in my career 'cause I worked there for 13 years all through my early, mid, late 20s and 30s. And then, after 13 years I left for a role at Facebook and I was there for about a year and a half. And it was not the experience that I had imagined when I joined, and I go into detail about it in "Lean Out" my book, but essentially, it was a pretty bad experience. And everybody in my life was telling me to go back to Google, I had a great career there, or find another company in tech. But that experience really put me in a very deep, dark place where I started asking myself these big life questions like who am I, and what do I want? And I knew there was something in me that was never going to manifest in the corporate world. My potential was limited as a very creative person. Now, while I was at Google, I had started this women's leadership series that was a bit irreverent and counter to the conventional wisdom, and it started to grow in popularity. I started doing lectures at not only at Google but other companies in New York City and other colleges in New York City. And at Facebook, I really came to terms with the fact that I wanted to devote my life to that sort of thing, speaking full time and writing a book, turning my lecture series into a book. So, I started doing that while I was at Facebook. And here I am now [crosstalk] I ... want to paint the picture because the context here is not just that you were a successful executive for over a decade at the top companies in the tech scene in the world, but when you decide to make that transition you're also a mother of three, a single mother of three. This is not just a random decision that as a 24 year old I can say, "Yeah, of course. A lot of people want to leave the corporate world and start their own companies" This is a little bit more complicated than the average 24 year old mind set, right? Absolutely. It's a great point and call out to make because it really defines the essence of my journey, which is here I am, I live in a nice neighborhood in New Jersey, I'm financially independent, and I have three kids to take care of, a rent to pay, and I'm not a financial risk taker. So, the idea that I would leave this world where I made this lucrative salary at these great companies and had a great career and just bet it all on this pipe dream, what had seemed like a pipe dream because I'd never written anything before. I mean I had written, but I had no name, I had no social following, I wasn't a recognized person, I'd never published anything. The idea that I can get a book deal, write a book, and then become a speaker and follow my passions which is really absurd from the outside in. And even, I have to tell you, in my own family, and I'm very close with my parents and they're wonderful and supportive, but my mom is the daughter of Eastern European immigrants who really came here and pulled themselves up from their boots. It's a very business oriented family. Like the idea that I would do this was so absurd. And we didn't talk about the book for about a year in my family. It was like it didn't exist. Wow. Yeah. I knew how crazy it seemed and talking about it with them upset me, because I really needed the support, and I know it upset them. So, we just didn't talk about it. And then I remember like one year at Thanksgiving we're all drinking, and then during dessert my brother in law was like, "So, how's the book going?" And it was like the music stopped and everyone's like [gasp] And so, I say that because I think it's really important to anyone that is going on this journey. I mean, you hear it to the point where it's cliche, but it's cliche because it's true, which is very, very few people understand what you're doing and support it because only you have the full picture of what's going on. Only you know what you're truly capable of. So, that was really difficult for me was to depart from the standard story of how my life was supposed to unfold, the storyline that was approved by my parents that I went along with without thinking about. And then the money piece was probably even bigger than that. So, I made a ... salary and I had a certain amount of savings. And when I decided to do this, I knew I was gonna be fired from Facebook. I had this, and I go into detail about it in the book. I got into this situation where I was, it was just a bad situation. So, knowing I was gonna be fired eventually, that's when everyone was telling me, like jump ship, go back to Google. And that's when I made the decision, "You know what? I'm gonna ride this out as long as I can so I can get the salary while I work on the book proposal." So, one really important piece of this. So, the summer of 2017, I started writing the book proposal in June of 2017. And the very first thing I did was I sat down and I Googled how to write a book. No joke. Really? Yeah. That was my first step. I did all the research, okay I have to write a proposal, I bought a book on how to write a book proposal. And I would wake up, keep in mind I was still working at Facebook. So I'd wake up, I thought, "When am I going to do this?" I have three kids. - Right. I have an hour and a half commute each way. So, I start waking up at 4:30 in the morning, and I worked on the book proposal for about an hour and a half. And then I would get the kids up and I would get to work and they would go to school. And any free time that I had, I was like possessed with this idea. I didn't tell very many people about it which is very different than how I'd handled creative ideas in the past. I get all excited, I tell everyone. And then ... I decided this was gonna be different in order to take myself seriously and to really do this I couldn't tell people about it. I needed to prove to myself that I was taking myself seriously. So, I did end up getting fired, again, I write all about it in the book, in September of 2017. I was about 95% done with the book proposal. And I think that was key, because I probably would have gone back to Google or a different company- If you didn't have the momentum for the book, right? Exactly. Now, just for the context for listeners, when you say book proposal, is this like an initial draft of the book, or is this an abstract for the book? Yeah. So, it's what you have to write in order to get a book deal. And a lot of people, and especially I think this is a point to just pause on for people that are younger that don't have the context. A lot of people self publish today, but that's where being a single mom comes in. I knew that nobody makes money on books these days. So, I knew that the way I was gonna make money was speaking, which is my passion anyway. And in order to get the kind of fees as a speaker that I needed, I needed to have a book published by a traditional publisher. Because if I went the grassroots, scrapie like gain a social media following, gain power that way, and then self publish or whatever, it was gonna take too long. I didn't have the luxury to do that, and I was starting from zero, but I knew that I really believed in my book idea and I knew it was gonna be a great book. So, the book proposal is what you have to write in order to get a book deal with a publisher. You don't have to write one if you're self publishing. And there's good reasons to self publish. And there's reasons to go with a traditional publisher. So, I started with the traditional, and the book proposal took me many months. I mean, I really put my blood, sweat, and tears into it. And once I was done, that's when I started looking for agents. And at this point, so I was fired in September, now it's like beginning of November, and I have no contacts in book publishing. I don't know anyone. So, I just started reaching out to everybody in my network asking if they could help me by introducing me to anyone they know that has anything to do with books. They wrote a book, they know someone who wrote a book, they know someone who works in publishing. They read books. Right. They read books. I was meeting with a million people and trying to figure out how to get an agent, 'cause it's really hard just to get an agent. Forget about getting a deal. So I end up, through someone I know, I end up getting an agent. We send the proposal out to like 20 publishing houses. 18 of them wrote back and said, "We love the idea. It's provocative, we love the voice, but" to summarize this isn't exactly what they said, but this was the sentiment, "It's too risky." Because the way business books work, they give deals to people they know have a following so that when the book comes out, the publisher doesn't have to spend money marketing it. This is how business books work, and this is why, in order to get published as a business book, you need to be an academic or a researcher. You need to be like an Adam Grant or Simon Sinek or Brené Brown, because then it's not risky. But I represented a huge risk because who's gonna buy a business book from somebody without credentials and without the academic or the title? So, 18 out of 20 loved it, but I was too risky, one we never heard back from, and then the one at HarperCollins Leadership, which was a developing entity within the bigger umbrella, loved it. And I, against all odds, got the deal. Then I had to write the book. I didn't even address your question which is what is a proposal. So, the proposal is really you selling the book. And in it, now if you're Justin Timberlake, you don't have to write a proposal. Like they write one for you basically and say, "Can you sign with us?" But if you're not, you need to explain the book, the concept, what it's about, and you have to sell it, which is a very different thing than just writing the book. It's like sending a slide deck to an investor. Yes, but it also has a very detailed outline of each chapter. It has like two or three sample chapters. It has a market analysis, so you have to do all the work for them. Oh, yeah. I had a whole customer segmentation. And I had done a lot of stuff like that at Google, a little at Facebook, where I knew how to sell something, I knew how to sell a value proposition, I knew how to market something. So, I wrote that proposal like my life depended on it, and that's what a proposal is, so. Wow. Okay, so talk to me a little bit about Lean Out, and then I'd love to also hear about the different speaking engagements and some of the messages that you're bringing to the world now through your journey. So, what is Lean Out about? I'm guessing that it has something to do with something that Sheryl wrote, but please tell me. So Sheryl Sandberg, of course, she's the COO of Facebook and she's the author of Lean In. And if you're a woman my age, you've probably read Lean In because this came out in 2013, and it was like a bombshell like women in leader. You know it has really defined modern feminism for the women of my generation. And my book is really a counter argument, because the premise of Lean In really is that women are oppressed by stereotypes and bias and that's why there's so few female executives in the corporate world and all that kind of stuff. And gender bias, all the popular themes of today. My book really is the counter argument which essentially, it's funny I haven't done an interview on the book in a while, so I'm like, "What was my messaging?" So, essentially what Lean Out is about is that it's really has nothing to do with women, it has to do with the system set up in the corporate world which are basically these were, a corporate hierarchy for power and dominance. It's a zero sum game for power and dominance. And it was designed by titans of the Industrial Age. And so, for example, there's research that shows that compared to men, women, so compared to women, men prefer competitive zero sum work environments and they perform better in them, whereas women prefer and perform better in collaborative win-win work environments. And by its nature, as a triangle, the corporate world is a zero sum game. And that's number one. Number two is that, compared to men, women have more life goals and they're of greater variety, whereas men have fewer and they're more focused on money and rank and their career. And so what happens is with promotions, when you get escalating management responsibility, right, that usually, pre-covid, required you to be in the office for face time. And that compromises the balance and flexibility that women really desire to reach a greater variety of life goals. Now, there are no value judgments, one's not better than the other, but we have to take a look at this system at work and why it is biased towards certain traits, because what really is happening is that the people that make it to the top make it because they have a certain cocktail of personality traits that lend themselves to a zero sum game for power and dominance. A lot of women don't aspire to manage large teams, that was an issue with me, and that's the only way to get promoted. And it's seen as a lack of ambition when that couldn't be further from the truth. Like you can make an impact and have ambition without managing large teams. In fact, I felt like being a manager diminished my impact, because I'm super creative, I was doing a lot of story development and training, and I think that puts a limit on the ceiling for people who don't aspire toward escalating amounts of power and authority. So, it's all about that, but it's told through stories about my time at Google and Facebook. So, I say that because it's not sort of some dry academic analysis of work; it's actually quite funny. And ... I wrote it for two reasons. One, I always felt like there was something wrong with me. Like I didn't fit in right, like a square peg in a round hole in the corporate world. And I thought that that was a reflection of something was wrong with me. And over 15 years, I started to understand things from a new perspective that there was nothing wrong with me, and I wrote the book I needed to read when I was starting out my career. It is a very honest assessment of what that world is all about and what it requires to succeed, whereas I didn't know what game I was playing when I started out. I just didn't understand it. And so, my book is really here's the game you're playing and if you love that, go for it. If you don't, nothing's wrong with you. It doesn't mean you don't have ambition. And it's just the nature of the game. You can change the rules, but you can also change how you play it. So, it's all about that. And then I also wrote it, I didn't hear any voices in the public conversation of women at work that I could relate to or that I identify with, so I wrote it for other women to feel heard and understood. And I think that's what it's really accomplished. I get messages from women all over the world thanking me for putting their thoughts and feelings into words that they didn't really know how to express. So, that's the book. There's one other thing I wanted to say. What about the responses from the other gender? I'm guessing that quite a few people from your past have read the book, took interest in it. I'm guessing that it's not just to women that read it. How did, 'cause it does sound like you're painting a picture here that, maybe controversial is not the right word, but it does- - Provocative It is provocative. So, how was the reception of that? So, the reception about it being provocative, everybody leading up to is, "Oh, you're gonna get tons of hate, man. It's really divisive." But I think for anyone who reads it, it's not. It's common sense, because it's a perspective that they hadn't thought about, but when it's shared, it makes so much sense. And I always say, I never really understood why it would be provocative, because if Sheryl Sandberg and I both have a goal of helping women and we both have two different perspectives on how to do that, it shouldn't be controversial. The women's voices shouldn't be limited to one woman who dominates the conversation, and anyone who disagrees has to be anti-woman. It's really counter to an antithetical, to the course of human progress, to be able to say just this one perspective means that you support women. It's not, and I think that it does a lot of damage to women. So, the reception has only been really like women reaching out from, I can't tell you, it's like they write me love letters and I love it, because I clearly gave them a voice, and that's what I wanted to do. The second half of the book I think would be really interesting to men. And the men that have read it really appreciate it, because at the end of the day it's not even about men and women; it's about a certain type of person that does well in that world, and both men and women they do and they don't. Maybe a little more women than men, but there's like a whole universe of men out there that can relate to a lot of the things. I did a Reddit AMA last year. That's when I really reached more men, but I think men assume that they're not gonna relate 'cause it's a female book, but then if they do read it, they end up really relating to it. Sure. No, no, that's amazing. So, 20 minutes go by so, so fast. It's unbelievable. If there is one message that I can take away from this or a lot of my friends, whether they're guys or girls at Stanford, for example, could take away from either the book or your different speaking engagements or your journey as a whole, what would that message be? Well, the message of the book at its very core is to, it's again cliche, but it's to be who you are and own it. And a lot of that is about defining success on your own terms, because there are so many things we can get caught up in, even school where success is defined for you and people just go along with the script. So, getting promoted at work, that's like the definition of success. But if you don't want certain things that the system doles out as rewards, you need to take a step back and really take a hard look at who you are, what you want, and then let go of the noise around you. And I really had to do that on this journey to be an entrepreneur. It's tough. I'll close with this 'cause I know a lot of people, this isn't really the topic that you talk about a lot. I was in the corporate world for 15 years. I made a great salary. I had the prestige of working at Google and Facebook and all these amazing experiences and security and benefits. But there was something in me that felt empty. And now that I'm on this opposite journey, it's very rewarding, but it's also very difficult. So the point I'm making is each has its trade offs, and you have to really recognize that going in. The one way I heard it put that captures it beautifully is when you leave the corporate world to start your own thing, you trade depression for anxiety. And I think that's the best, most concise way to put it. It is not easy. I mean, I miss that world for so many reasons. I would never trade what I'm doing now for anything. At the same time, it's tough, but that's life, and I'd rather live doing this and taking risks and seeing how far I can go. So, that's just me. But I want an end on that note. Marissa, thank you very, very much. This was wonderful. I have to ask the last question, three words that you would use to describe yourself. I would say creative, free spirited, and resilient. Marissa, thank you very much. It sounds like an incredible journey, difficult and joyous and optimistic and rewarding at the end. And definitely thank you for spreading this message. At the end, I think, looking at the world that I'm growing up in, it is sometimes cut throat and there's a lot of competition sometimes. I'm very fortunate to be in a community where I feel that there's a lot of collaboration, even more than there is competition. But at the end, it's about finding your personal passion and reward. And so thank you for sharing that message. And stay safe and stay healthy. Thank you. Thanks for having me. And we forgot to mention that you also started a podcast in March. I know we're out of time, but just give me two sentences on that. I'll quickly say to follow me on Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, Marissa Beth Orr. B-E-T-H is my middle name. And then I just started a podcast in March called, Nice Girls Don't Watch The Bachelor. And that's meant to be irreverent. It's a story I can go into it another time. But it's available on iTunes and Google Play and everywhere podcasts are. So, thank you. Wonderful. Thank you very much. Stay safe and stay healthy. Thank you.
