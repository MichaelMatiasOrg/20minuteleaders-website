1
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,667
Gil Frostig.
Thank you so much for

2
00:04:42,692 --> 00:04:44,734
being on 20-minute Leaders.

3
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,792
My pleasure.

4
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:46,978
So good to have you.

5
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:49,887
And I'm used to seeing you
once a month on the J-Ventures

6
00:04:49,912 --> 00:04:52,808
at the J-Ventures monthly
meeting where you're also an LP.

7
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,469
So now we have to
do this,

8
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,194
And now we have to do this
online like this.

9
00:04:57,195 --> 00:04:59,662
But actually you're more
than an LP at J-Ventures

10
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:01,387
Right
you're actually taking a much more of a

11
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,164
Chief Technology role.
Correct?

12
00:05:04,248 --> 00:05:06,041
Yeah, I'm pretty active there.

13
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:09,682
What does that mean to be a sort
of a chief technology officer

14
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:12,065
of a fund like J-Ventures?

15
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,590
What does that even mean?

16
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,356
That makes me very proud actually.

17
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:21,560
I really like the
whole concept of J-Ventures.

18
00:05:21,585 --> 00:05:24,455
It used to be called
J-Angels prior to that.

19
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,912
I think it's a model
of a VC second to none.

20
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:32,648
There are some things
here which are so unique

21
00:05:32,673 --> 00:05:35,921
and we're going to do great
business on one hand but

22
00:05:35,946 --> 00:05:39,254
lso at the same time,
we're going to build a culture

23
00:05:39,902 --> 00:05:43,722
of the community that is
going to be first of its kind.

24
00:05:44,747 --> 00:05:46,496
A capitalistic Kibbutz.

25
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:49,021
I've been stealing that sentence
from quite a few people.

26
00:05:49,022 --> 00:05:51,022
Gil, we only have 19 minutes left.

27
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:54,916
I'm already upset.
So much to cover.

28
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:58,130
You were at Intel since
graduating from the Technion.

29
00:05:58,155 --> 00:06:02,655
Spent 30 years there.
Climbed the ladder of success

30
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,800
from an entry-level chip designer to a VP.

31
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,600
Moved on onto Qualcomm.

32
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,220
Built products that emerged as number
one in the market of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.

33
00:06:12,266 --> 00:06:14,160
You're going to explain
to me what that means.

34
00:06:14,185 --> 00:06:17,185
And now you're in Silicon Valley.
One of the most well-respected advisors,

35
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:20,307
board members, and investors.

36
00:06:20,332 --> 00:06:25,160
Take me back. Technion. You graduate
and you're entering Intel.

37
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:28,085
What is that like spending
30 years at the company

38
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
and climbing up the
ladder of success?

39
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:35,994
Well first of all,
Intel has been a fantastic company for me.

40
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:43,019
It is a big company, so actually I got
opportunities here and there. Okay.

41
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:45,867
It was always under
you know for 30 years,

42
00:06:45,892 --> 00:06:48,192
it was under under the Intel
umbrella, I call it.

43
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
But they were very
different things.

44
00:06:50,984 --> 00:06:53,984
So I did start as the
chip design guy in Haifa.

45
00:06:55,464 --> 00:07:00,930
And over time, I moved to the
US and I got a great opportunity

46
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:04,295
to be a Co-GM of the
business unit there.

47
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,720
And this really opened a
lot of opportunities for me.

48
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:15,229
And I was I guess very lucky
which is a big part of the story.

49
00:07:15,754 --> 00:07:18,454
What is it like fighting
for those ranks?

50
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Because you know at least you know
young entrepreneurs like myself

51
00:07:21,787 --> 00:07:26,287
all we hear about is, "Yeah, you could join
a company like Intel, IBM, Google, etc.

52
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,500
and then slowly climb the ladder
but that's really hard.

53
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:33,098
Why don't you go, do a start-up, get acquired
maybe and then just join as a director"

54
00:07:33,123 --> 00:07:36,109
I mean talked to me about
your experience going through what you did

55
00:07:36,134 --> 00:07:37,997
I don't think there's one answer

56
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:40,365
which fits everyone. Okay.
Michael: Yeah.

57
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,691
Some people are really
born to be in startups.

58
00:07:43,716 --> 00:07:46,571
Okay, this is their personality.

59
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:49,874
Of course, we know the percentage of
successes of startups.

60
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,700
Somebody wants to try and you
know generate some calculation.

61
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,600
They may but it
doesn't mean anything.

62
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,180
Did you know, did you think you're going
to get to where you got to at Intel?

63
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:08,793
I get opportunities which were
far better than my dreams.

64
00:08:08,818 --> 00:08:10,169
I can tell you that.

65
00:08:10,694 --> 00:08:12,020
That's incredible.

66
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,950
Yeah and I'm really
grateful for that.

67
00:08:15,017 --> 00:08:18,617
And you know I started
as a young engineer,

68
00:08:18,618 --> 00:08:22,118
there were very good
people around me. Okay.

69
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:26,934
And this gave me a huge
push through teamwork.

70
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:34,459
Okay. Which Israel was built on the
shoulders of several you know very good people

71
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:39,190
who just created the culture.
And we were helping each other.

72
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,422
And it was just a fantastic
stuff for my career.

73
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:50,423
And then actually, people in Haifa
helped me get to the opportunity I got.

74
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:56,786
Intel in the US in southern
Oregon in the LAN business. Okay.

75
00:08:56,811 --> 00:09:02,121
And I got to be a Co-GM there which
was phenomenal experience for me.

76
00:09:02,346 --> 00:09:04,758
OGM is?

77
00:09:04,782 --> 00:09:05,324
Sorry?

78
00:09:05,349 --> 00:09:06,950
OGM. What is that?

79
00:09:06,975 --> 00:09:08,326
Co-GM.

80
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,989
Co-GM. Okay. Co-General Manager.

81
00:09:11,014 --> 00:09:13,751
It's the language its called ... in a box.
So, I was mostly

82
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:16,336
the operations and the
engineering person

83
00:09:16,461 --> 00:09:22,763
and I had a person and I had a partner
who was mostly marketing and sales

84
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:27,465
and together, we build strategy, and working on the budgets

85
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,266
and leadership
of the organization.

86
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:32,767
We actually grew in our organization
which was about $250 million

87
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:40,166
over three years in the late 90s to
become a $1 billion dollar organization.
Wow

88
00:09:41,412 --> 00:09:45,906
And so you know each person can
have opportunities, different places

89
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:49,079
can excel in different places--

90
00:09:49,104 --> 00:09:50,341
Not that many you know.

91
00:09:50,366 --> 00:09:53,740
You know they say that if you want to
run a billion-dollar business,

92
00:09:53,765 --> 00:09:56,965
you should go be an entrepreneur
because that's really the only way

93
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,900
but no,
you went you know the Intel route

94
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:04,634
and you still got to manage a
billion-dollar business. Wow.

95
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:09,730
One of the other fortunes was they
never worked on an x86 processor at Intel.

96
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:15,035
I always worked on other
businesses which were new to Intel.

97
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,622
So we built a you
know billion-dollar,

98
00:10:18,647 --> 00:10:22,774
this business out of networking
LANs, a LANs solutions.

99
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:27,214
Then our team,
my partner and I were assigned to build

100
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:30,164
this new protocol nobody heard of
which was Wi-fi.

101
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:32,088
Wi-fi. I've heard of that before.

102
00:10:32,113 --> 00:10:33,813
Yeah
But back then

103
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:38,523
Yeah. People people try to have
wireless solutions for a long time.

104
00:10:38,548 --> 00:10:40,244
But this was the
right time definitely.

105
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:42,569
So just to get a context,

106
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:47,570
we are talking about the inception,
the years where the Internet is born

107
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,100
because you know talking to somebody
like me, I don't know what that means.

108
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,900
But there was a period where
the Internet needed to be born

109
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:01,031
and I get to be speaking now to one of
the pioneers who got it out to the world.

110
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,845
Okay. I'll buy that.

111
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:08,749
I think the Internet's really
start to spread around in mid- 90s.

112
00:11:08,774 --> 00:11:12,724
And in the late 90's,
we were assigned go and implement this

113
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:17,481
you know new wireless protocol.

114
00:11:17,506 --> 00:11:22,373
And the folks who worked in
Israel on chips for plans.

115
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:26,501
They said, "Hey, can you do the same
thing just without the wire?"

116
00:11:26,526 --> 00:11:29,555
And what do Israeli
engineers say?

117
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,126
"Of course we can."

118
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,326
So this was '98 or '99.

119
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:42,351
And by 2003, we came out with a
solution Wi-Fi into the Intel platform

120
00:11:42,573 --> 00:11:45,152
which was called Centrino.

121
00:11:45,177 --> 00:11:49,971
Again, you need to be half a
dinosaur to remember that name.

122
00:11:49,996 --> 00:11:51,785
It became a real success.

123
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:55,274
So this was actually together
not only the engineering efforts

124
00:11:55,299 --> 00:12:00,445
but also all the marketing efforts
and the market creation effort.

125
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:08,470
This was actually the one product and the
one brand which opened up the Wi-Fi market.

126
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:14,100
And later on, it was so gratifying
to see people who

127
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:18,645
they just need Wi-Fi as the same as
they need oxygen to some extent.

128
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,700
Okay. It became so pervasive.

129
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,243
You know actually Gil you mentioned
that I was in Kilimanjaro a year ago,

130
00:12:25,474 --> 00:12:28,185
exactly a year ago
with my dad my brother.

131
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,910
We were up on the mountain and we
didn't have Wi-Fi but we had oxygen.

132
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And at some point, I was thinking
what do I want more right now?

133
00:12:34,272 --> 00:12:38,272
And I didn't have my Wi-Fi for a week
and I didn't know what I valued more.

134
00:12:39,255 --> 00:12:46,015
Right right. So this is very rewarding you
know to see how successful this became.

135
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:51,953
So I was just you know fortunate to be part
of that team which was assigned to start it.

136
00:12:51,978 --> 00:12:54,913
We started something
on the side.

137
00:12:54,938 --> 00:12:58,523
You know for Intel suddenly
they decided to have it as

138
00:12:58,548 --> 00:13:01,368
one of the key components
on the platform.

139
00:13:01,393 --> 00:13:05,613
Wait, that was a side project
it started as a side project?

140
00:13:05,638 --> 00:13:08,969
Yeah. It was something on the
side for this LAN division.

141
00:13:08,994 --> 00:13:11,387
Maybe they can do
something out of it

142
00:13:11,412 --> 00:13:14,985
and then the CEO of Intel realized
that, "You know what?

143
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:19,961
This could be one of the keystones
here for a new type of platform for Intel"

144
00:13:19,986 --> 00:13:24,887
where we brand not only to the processor but
we brand several elements of the platform -

145
00:13:24,912 --> 00:13:29,624
the processor, the networking, the chips,
the memory. You know things of that nature.
Right

146
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,980
And with all the additional
efforts on the marketing side,

147
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,144
it became you know a big hit.

148
00:13:39,663 --> 00:13:43,350
And this actually opened the
entire Wi-Fi market up here.

149
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:47,390
What do you learn from that?
So having gone through this experience,

150
00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:49,642
you know I can look at it
in the textbook and see,

151
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:53,231
"Okay, so this is one of the key innovations
that really transformed people's lives."

152
00:13:53,256 --> 00:13:58,672
You experienced it. so what do you learn about,
what can you teach me about organizations

153
00:13:58,697 --> 00:14:04,423
or about you know innovation,
and entrepreneurship from this example

154
00:14:04,448 --> 00:14:09,495
of this Wi-Fi technology being
born out of these circumstances?

155
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,953
Yeah. So I think there are sometimes cases
were somebody high there starts something

156
00:14:14,978 --> 00:14:19,980
without knowing even if it's
going to be something good or not

157
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:21,662
and you have to try that.

158
00:14:21,687 --> 00:14:24,748
We also tried DSL and
it didn't go anywhere.

159
00:14:24,773 --> 00:14:27,321
We also tried the cable
modem solutions for the PC

160
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:28,886
and it didn't go anywhere.

161
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:32,405
but we tried Wi-Fi, we started
Wi-Fi and at some point in time,

162
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:36,190
there was a key strategic
decision by the CEO.

163
00:14:36,215 --> 00:14:46,072
So this was, in my opinion, an example where CEO can decide
on some strategy which really makes a difference. Okay.

164
00:14:46,097 --> 00:14:50,102
And because of that, from something on the
side, we just joined the eye of the storm.

165
00:14:50,127 --> 00:14:56,657
Okay. And we had weekly meetings with the
CEO to make sure everything is on track.

166
00:14:56,882 --> 00:14:58,073
With the CEO of Intel?

167
00:14:58,074 --> 00:14:59,299
Yeah.

168
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:00,087
Wow.

169
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:04,112
I mean the chipset, and the processor,
and our solution, and everything else.

170
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:06,613
And you know PC platform is
something pretty complex.

171
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:11,227
And you don't want to be
the guy who's going to delay

172
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:13,957
the new rollout
of a new platform.

173
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:17,799
But it was you know and then
there was also another element

174
00:15:17,824 --> 00:15:22,185
not about the design which
was about enabling the market.

175
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:28,235
sS the marketing team came and said, "We're
going to build outside places, coffee shops.

176
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,935
You know 400 of them that
will be utilizing Wi-Fi."

177
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:40,265
So the CEO looked at them and said,
"Why 400? why not 4,000?" Okay.

178
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,863
And this was so meaningful.
and yes, they got the 4,000

179
00:15:44,888 --> 00:15:47,896
and it really went
terrifically from there.

180
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:52,272
And other companies also
grew up in that area.

181
00:15:52,297 --> 00:15:55,682
Some of them thank Intel 'till today
because they became rich too.

182
00:15:55,707 --> 00:15:57,252
Wow.
Gil: yeah, it was

183
00:15:57,277 --> 00:15:58,065
That's incredible.

184
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,523
And what does that mean
building the platform

185
00:16:00,548 --> 00:16:06,376
that at the end gets number one market
share in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi technologies?

186
00:16:06,401 --> 00:16:10,886
Well, this comes to you know your
work as a team and as a P&L

187
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:13,899
So the trick in big
companies like Intel,

188
00:16:13,924 --> 00:16:15,841
they put people
in business units.

189
00:16:16,504 --> 00:16:19,489
People have a lot of affinity
to their own businesses

190
00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:21,850
and they wanted to succeed
in the marketplace.

191
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:25,304
I'll tell you the story actually about
our Gigabit Ethernet controller.

192
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:30,154
Okay. LAN controller which
we built around the same time

193
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:37,560
and we competed head to head with Broadcom.
It was huge battle. Okay.

194
00:16:38,609 --> 00:16:44,558
And it was just about the
question of who can do faster,

195
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:47,627
who can do develop it
faster and high quality.

196
00:16:47,652 --> 00:16:55,349
At the end of it, I remember till today
Dell was the king of the hill in PC's at that time

197
00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:00,150
and we wanted really bad to
win Dell and so did Broadcom.

198
00:17:00,243 --> 00:17:07,125
And the design win changed places at Dell
between Intel and Broadcom five times.

199
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,812
Last and fifth time was Intel.

200
00:17:09,837 --> 00:17:15,586
Okay. This was one of the
best days of my career. Okay.

201
00:17:15,611 --> 00:17:20,423
Especially when you take into account
the guy who ran Broadcom at the time,

202
00:17:20,448 --> 00:17:23,351
Henry Nicholas and his
eccentric behavior.

203
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:27,593
You can write about it,
you can read about it in the media,

204
00:17:27,618 --> 00:17:30,714
in the gossip columns,
wherever you want to see it.

205
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:32,819
But it was a huge, huge win.

206
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:38,368
Wow. That's just incredible.
and Gil, you transition from this then to,

207
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,500
you transition from that to
Silicon Valley helping companies,

208
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,550
helping both early and late
stage companies succeed

209
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,100
both at GigCapital where
you're a strategic advisor

210
00:17:48,147 --> 00:17:50,647
but also as part of J-Ventures.

211
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:56,150
So why is that? Because you go from
these huge, huge corporations. 30 years.

212
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,850
VP at intel.
VP at Qualcomm and all of a sudden,

213
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,488
you're working with startups.

214
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:04,375
Yeah, so I've been in the
Valley here for 20 years.

215
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,787
I still work here for Intel
quite a bit and for Qualcomm.

216
00:18:09,812 --> 00:18:15,076
But since the day I got here,
I actually started to get involved with startups.

217
00:18:15,101 --> 00:18:18,145
I still found the time.
get engaged with startups.

218
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:21,333
Usually, they came through
my personal network, friends.

219
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:25,146
okay, people from me Israel
or something like that.

220
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,660
and because I missed that.

221
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:31,327
I really wanted to learn more about that
and help where I keep where I could.

222
00:18:31,352 --> 00:18:35,251
And I found some great startups
and great people to work with.

223
00:18:35,276 --> 00:18:39,526
And over time,
I also learned to trade by doing so.

224
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:43,923
At some point in time, I decided,
this is about two three years ago,

225
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:51,124
I decided, "Okay, corporate America
was great for me. I'm thankful

226
00:18:51,149 --> 00:18:55,146
And I want to do everything around
startups going forward." Okay.

227
00:18:55,171 --> 00:19:01,417
And I just you know I left.
I went to pitch events, pitch nights

228
00:19:01,442 --> 00:19:05,416
between San Jose and San Francisco
every day in different place

229
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:10,452
just to meet more people.
see more startups, see what I learn,

230
00:19:10,477 --> 00:19:12,984
see which one I can
actually help.

231
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:15,949
You know I started to be an advisor.

232
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Many of them
an investor in several of them

233
00:19:18,178 --> 00:19:24,775
And then I had you know,
then I found Oded Hermoni

234
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,134
and J-Angels as it were
called at the time.

235
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:31,737
And this is you know a
bunch of great people.

236
00:19:31,762 --> 00:19:36,398
Some of them are VC's in the day job.
Some of them are

237
00:19:36,423 --> 00:19:42,646
CEO's who were successful in
driving their companies' exits.

238
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:47,140
Corporate people.
So it's a great mix.

239
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:54,365
And right now, I feel more comfortable
investing through or with J-Ventures

240
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:59,706
because I think we're really doing a
good job here on due diligence side

241
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:02,353
as well as on the connection side.

242
00:20:02,378 --> 00:20:07,239
You know we're having 60 members right now.
And people are very connected.

243
00:20:07,264 --> 00:20:11,261
And we can not only be investing
and making money out of it

244
00:20:11,286 --> 00:20:13,695
but to actually help the
startups that we invest in

245
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,493
through the connections.
we have people in the Valley

246
00:20:16,518 --> 00:20:19,595
and we have people
around the world as well.

247
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,064
So this became a very,
very quality expense for me.

248
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:26,643
I am mostly,
most of the my time is about startups.

249
00:20:26,668 --> 00:20:31,634
I met two new startups
today, earlier. Okay.

250
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:35,627
And it's it's wonderful.
Michael: I love it.

251
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:41,075
Nominal ideas. Okay. you see great
people and you can help them.

252
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:43,373
What could be better? Tell me.

253
00:20:43,398 --> 00:20:46,337
A 100 percent no.
But Gil, are you still

254
00:20:46,362 --> 00:20:49,848
in the you know hardcore
networking scene

255
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:53,349
or are you now branching
out to other things as well?

256
00:20:53,594 --> 00:20:55,342
I did branch out a lot.

257
00:20:55,767 --> 00:21:00,097
Networking is one field.
If I can help there, it's great.

258
00:21:00,122 --> 00:21:03,600
But over the last 20 years,
I really learned a lot of things

259
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:07,193
which are you know relevant
to many many types of startups.

260
00:21:07,218 --> 00:21:14,417
Could be Fintech. Could be biotech.
Medtech. Okay. Really lots of areas.

261
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:18,063
Now if I don't have anything smart to
tell them, I don't tell them anything

262
00:21:18,088 --> 00:21:21,924
but there's some experience
which you know plays by now

263
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:23,830
and I can help
really a lot of guys.

264
00:21:23,855 --> 00:21:26,938
So you know give me some of those
earned secrets over the years

265
00:21:26,963 --> 00:21:31,790
both as you know corporate America
but also as a start-up advisor

266
00:21:31,815 --> 00:21:33,022
and a strategic investor.

267
00:21:33,047 --> 00:21:37,084
What are some the most important
things to keep in mind especially now

268
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:39,294
considering the times
that we're at now?

269
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:41,476
And let's say for
early-stage startups,

270
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:45,264
what is it the common thing that you
see come up both that at J-Ventures

271
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:49,289
but in other startups that you
see that some phenomenas?

272
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,912
Yeah. So there has to be
some good differentiation.

273
00:21:54,923 --> 00:21:59,991
Now differentiation could be in the technology
or could be in the marketing of it or wherever.

274
00:22:00,017 --> 00:22:05,645
But if you don't come with
something which is really new

275
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:10,685
and gain you lot of momentum
relative to the competition,

276
00:22:10,686 --> 00:22:12,728
it's going to be very tough.

277
00:22:13,776 --> 00:22:16,137
It's going to be
very, very tough.

278
00:22:16,162 --> 00:22:20,098
People who are open to feedback. Okay.
Sometimes they need to pivot.

279
00:22:20,123 --> 00:22:24,176
They come with the pivot
the startups. And you know what?

280
00:22:24,201 --> 00:22:27,754
It's a great idea. I mean not having
your people every three weeks.

281
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:32,968
But you know you listen to the market. You
listen to customers. Listen to other people.

282
00:22:32,993 --> 00:22:37,649
You still have you know the initial
strength that's you and your team

283
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,400
that you can say,
"Hey, you know what?

284
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:45,102
It could be more applicable here
and I have also some connections

285
00:22:45,103 --> 00:22:49,706
or this investor given more
connections in that area"

286
00:22:49,797 --> 00:22:53,191
Okay. So if they keep
flexibility, it helps a lot.

287
00:22:54,116 --> 00:22:56,716
Right. And I mean you know a lot
of the startups that we're seeing at J-ventures,

288
00:22:56,849 --> 00:23:00,649
a lot of them are early stage
and you can always assume that

289
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,700
throughout the lifetime of this company,
which hopefully will end in success,

290
00:23:04,744 --> 00:23:06,923
there's going to be
quite a few pivots.

291
00:23:06,948 --> 00:23:12,911
So a big part of also the due diligence is understanding
who are the founders behind this great execution up to now

292
00:23:12,936 --> 00:23:16,343
and are they flexible
to pivot when necessary?

293
00:23:16,368 --> 00:23:19,271
Let's say like in
times of COVID-19.

294
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:23,485
Yes and the founders have to be very
also open to learning new things

295
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:29,052
because if they are first time CEO or first
time CTO, they have to understand that it is a script

296
00:23:29,077 --> 00:23:30,983
and how it evolves over time.

297
00:23:32,508 --> 00:23:35,994
You know things like
a lot of presentations.

298
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:39,281
So I see a lot of companies
on their presentation

299
00:23:39,306 --> 00:23:41,006
or you know before
angels or VC's.

300
00:23:41,007 --> 00:23:43,507
They tend to talk a lot
about the technology.

301
00:23:43,508 --> 00:23:49,134
They tend give a big, big background of how the
world is changing, what are the new trends

302
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:54,364
while these things could be known
already or too deep technically.

303
00:23:54,389 --> 00:23:57,282
And you have to be a businessman.
Okay.

304
00:23:57,306 --> 00:24:04,245
You have to understand that the financials
that you do here, you plan here,

305
00:24:04,271 --> 00:24:10,250
should be very,
very clear and substantiate it. Okay.

306
00:24:10,274 --> 00:24:14,405
And the entire story
of how you raise funds

307
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:19,791
and all the ins and outs that people
really care when they're investors.

308
00:24:19,816 --> 00:24:22,678
Okay, your personal
story could be nice,

309
00:24:22,703 --> 00:24:25,609
but don't spend time on it.
Don't spend time on it.

310
00:24:25,634 --> 00:24:28,134
These are businesspeople
who sit in front of you.

311
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:35,122
They want to see how you,
they're going to make 10X on your startup.

312
00:24:35,622 --> 00:24:42,438
It's not cynical. It's a very good, it's
a very good test. Okay. For you as well.

313
00:24:42,963 --> 00:24:46,828
And you have to understand
the rules and get into this

314
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:48,804
you know very, very quickly.

315
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:53,465
Otherwise, you're going to be in love in some
of your slides which are not that relevantm

316
00:24:53,665 --> 00:24:55,665
and you're going to
waste people's time.

317
00:24:55,963 --> 00:25:00,578
And then, you will not going to have enough
time to explain the important things.

318
00:25:00,579 --> 00:25:06,157
So after two years of J- Ventures, after
seeing 200 startups in the last three years,

319
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:13,274
I actually wrote my own lists of slides
and what the investor care about.

320
00:25:13,905 --> 00:25:20,508
And I sit with CEOs and help them
understand what they need to present,

321
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:22,509
how do you need to present it.

322
00:25:22,686 --> 00:25:26,222
Don't need to rush.
Speaking too quickly. Okay.

323
00:25:27,046 --> 00:25:31,399
There's a lot to learn. and you get
one shot. You get one shot. That's it.

324
00:25:31,424 --> 00:25:32,858
It has to be perfect.

325
00:25:32,883 --> 00:25:37,194
Sometimes people tend to wing it and think
that "It's okay, my invention is so smart.

326
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:38,429
everybody will get it."

327
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,684
The answer is no,
they will not get it

328
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:43,861
unless you really,
really simplify it and explain it slowly.

329
00:25:43,886 --> 00:25:46,031
I love it. Gil, I love it.
I love it. I love it.

330
00:25:46,056 --> 00:25:49,148
But we have to we have to finish, I can't believe
it's 20 minutes already.

331
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:52,618
I have the most important
question for you.

332
00:25:52,643 --> 00:25:54,831
Three words that you would
best describe yourself as

333
00:25:54,856 --> 00:25:59,356
or as anybody at J-Ventures would
describe Gil Frostig as.

334
00:26:02,476 --> 00:26:02,976
Okay.

335
00:26:02,977 --> 00:26:09,377
So I would say first of
all, grateful. Okay.

336
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,000
Okay. Finally.

337
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,068
First of all grateful.

338
00:26:11,934 --> 00:26:13,976
I think I've had a
hundred episodes.

339
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:17,376
I don't remember grateful
as being a word yet.

340
00:26:17,402 --> 00:26:21,386
Okay.
The other one is I love people.

341
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,327
And I enjoy working with them.
Okay.

342
00:26:24,252 --> 00:26:27,073
It's just you know
just a dream for me.

343
00:26:27,098 --> 00:26:33,617
And the other thing is try to be as thorough
as possible in this environment. Okay.

344
00:26:33,642 --> 00:26:35,922
Definitely. Definitely
Gil, such a pleasure.

345
00:26:35,947 --> 00:26:40,036
And thank you for all everything that
you're teaching me at J-Ventures and here.

346
00:26:40,061 --> 00:26:43,832
And then I look forward to maintaining this
relationship and learning more from you.

347
00:26:43,857 --> 00:26:45,986
Thank you very much.
Gil: All right.

348
00:26:46,011 --> 00:26:47,750
Thank you. Thank you for the stage here.
