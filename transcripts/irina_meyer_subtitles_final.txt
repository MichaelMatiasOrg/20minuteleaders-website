Irina Meyer, thank you so much for joining me on 20 Minute Leaders. Thank you. Thank you very much for having me. I love your show. Thank you. You have such a non-linear path that I can't wait to dive deep and understand how your values are progressing you through your different life decisions. But, you know, as a brief intro, which will do no service to the incredible things you've done. First of all, you're an Emmy Award winner. Let's put that out there. I can't wait to hear what that's about. But you actually started, or you didn't start you progressed through, financial institutions like Bank of America. You're a huge investor in I think, international investor because you speak six languages. I have to understand what that's about. Irina, talk to me. Who are you? How do you do all this stuff? I don't know. I just do things which the most normal, the most natural for me. Which means I always do the thing that I feel is the right thing. I walk away from the people who are wrong people, and I think that's very important. And I follow the passion that I have. And I always, at any point in time, make sure that I give back. So any time I fail and or I'm a bad situation, I push forward. Any time I win, I have to pause and make sure that I share my success with other people who also need a break. So that's kind of how I roll. And also, I learn all the time. I never stop learning. I love it. I just love it. Okay. So, talk to me, how do you start from a place like Bank of America and then move on to a place like ABC? Motion pictures? Win an Emmy? What's it about? So, I was working and indeed in the technology group, I was at the Bank of America and it's actually in the beginning was countrywide. And I was working doing the technical risk assessments for their central group which means for their headquarters. All their projects of the value above $20 million of business impact will go for me. Then when 2008 happened, and I just was seeing what was unfolding with the countrywide that no matter how good the two hundred people around me were, that the company was deeply corrupt and created such an incredibly devastating trickle effect of contributing to it in the country. And even though I just was promoted four months prior to AVP, I walked away because I never wanted, and I didn't have another job lined up, because they just I knew that was not right. And that was me walking away from the wrong people, and I didn't want to create any kind of explanation for myself why I should stay. So Irina on that note. So, you mentioned right at the offset that you're guided by your values and that guides your non traditional non-linear path. What are these core values that you are addressing here? Absolutely. So, you need to make sure that your work being contributed to something good. Greater good. You do not give away your work for something which is meaningless or have some kind of short term pragmatic effect. It's just not for me. Whenever I work, it's really need to be to make better the social environment. It needs to be towards the creativity. It needs to be for the better of the of the people. If it does not go there, it just, it stops for me. And I know that I have quite significant success, and I have my personal capital fund that I run and it's international, but I never followed what will be my short term or even mid-term financial gain because money is gonna follow you when you're doing the right thing and you'll work with the right people. And it doesn't have to be immediate. But it always will. That's my experience. Inspiring. Okay. So, moving on to digital media and television. What is this industry that I, I don't know anything about it. So, you go. What does it mean even digital media and making those innovations over there? Of course. So, digital media progresses. So what is it today in 2020 is very different when what it was in 2010 So, when I was there, digital media it is the way to for the people to connect with whatever they love. So it doesn't have to be for the network television. I was working for ABC, but only digital media. That's me. That whenever there were Oscars, and I was running Oscar's production for there three years, is to bring the experience to the people. Not make it, not live it as an elite. You know, you just there in on some kind of magazine cover Angelina Jolie and you have no relation. You create those bridges. You connect it via your laptop, your computer, and many of the IOS devices, Androids. So you bring that to people. How to make that relevant to you? And every time and every day of working in digital media, that's what we were doing. ... about Oscars. Make sure you are there. That means that the cameras that I would supervise to put in, they ... every person from millions connecting to the livestream. They had an impression that they can move it at any point. And they can be there and watch what people do during their stars, during the commercial breaks. And bring it home. And that is really fascinating because that's what we want. We do not want to just be on the outskirts. We want to be part of this show. And that's what the digital will do. So, what are some of the challenges that you faced as you were trying to innovate this concept? So, what does that even mean for me to sit at home and be present at the Oscars? For example, you are invited. That's the thing. You receive the golden envelope. You're invited. You can choose to go and see where the stars take champagne. You can decide what dress a trophy girl, I am not being obnoxious it's ... usual name called trophy girl. The girl who brings the who brings the Oscar. That's the position. What will she be wearing? And that will be competition among 10 different upcoming totally unknown designers. - Unbelievable And people can be present at the catwalk which will be done before. And the winner will be announced during this time. That means that on the red carpet, there will be ... digital media hosts. By the way, we had our booth right next to Oprah's. And then where we will be talking for our fans, for our viewers from home. Not necessarily just bringing more people to the ABC channel so that the ABC channel will sell more ads. It's for the people who can just log on their phone and or on their tablet and just be there. And their questions will be answered. Amazing. But that's radically different from being an investor. You're investing in early stage startups yet here you are being a creative. You're running creativity to how to integrate the at home experience with something as amazing as the Oscars. And by the way, you got the Emmy in 2011, and what was that for? For innovation and digital media? Yes, it was outstanding achievement in interactive media. And that was, the product was Oscars digital experience. So, that's the whole package that we did and that we were unfolding for the five months prior to the show. We recorded, we created for television shows, for web presence. We did meetings with the stars. With the nominated stars. There were designer contests. There was sweepstakes. There were many things prior to the event. So, the whole package of it was Oscars digital experience. And we rolled it out on IOS only it was barely eight months after iPod was out. And it took I believe three years until something similar were rolled out by somebody else which was MTV later on. So, yeah, it was actually a big deal from technological perspective. I worked with over 20 different contractors in addition to over 15 of different internal groups for ABC and the infrastructure groups at Disney which is a parent company of ABC. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Okay. Let's move on to your two investments. You're running an early stage fund. You're investing internationally, which is unique in its own way because most venture capital funds, especially early stage, they're focused on a certain geographical region. Yet you're branching out. And is that because you speak six languages? Is that a part of it? No, I'm not sure because I learn languages for years before they eventually become useful. Because it is. So, it helps when it comes. But I am once again, I avoid this pragmatic effect. Why don't I learn German so I can invest in Switzerland? It happens in a similar way. Or why do I learn Mandarin Chinese for the last 10 years and it's only a year ago when I became a board member for a company which is doing development in China. So it comes eventually together but it's not because of that. And I agree with you this is not conventional. I'm the only person in my company. The fund is my personal. I don't have any LPs. And for an individual, a one woman operation to say, you know US is not enough. I made only last year six investments in Israel. And I invested in a Swiss company and I'm planning to do more. I'm a member of two groups in Zurich and in Zug. And yeah, it is, but there is a method to the madness. I am not just being trying to overextend myself. I plan specifically. Let's say when I go to Israel. I have a plan. What is it? What type of company interests me? What type of innovation? What groups I need to work? I know what proportion of my portfolio I want to be dedicated to this specific area which is med device life science in Israel which I find absolutely extraordinary. And that I wanted to be within about 25 to 30 to 33% of my portfolio. And I just work diligently for a very long time before I trigger my investments, but whenever they are ready, I'm very decisive and I'm just going and I'm executing it. Same thing that I would do in Switzerland. And recently I invested even in a company out of Sofia, Bulgaria. My very first east European company. How did you even find these companies because the deal flow is its own struggle. There's so many early stage VCs around the world now. I don't know how many there are in Eastern Europe, but around the world and Israel and the US of course, there is a lot. So how do you go and find those deals so that when you want to be decisive and execute, you actually have access to the best deals? So that is an absolutely wonderful question. And that is the biggest issue I think that exists with private investors is the access to the deal flow and be able to see through it correctly. And I've been very fortunate in the fact that I've been able to create an extraordinary network. And because I'm never afraid to walk away from something that doesn't work or being very outspoken when something is subpar, that I have really wonderful collaborators. And I spend huge amount of my time, perhaps over 80% of my time, doing pro bono work for other investors. When I do that, and I do not ask for any, and that goes back to my core values. And I do not ask for shares or payment of any kind. I will get back the most interesting deals these people will be working on. And they will be sharing it with me that they might be even reluctant to do with somebody else. And it's not only with private individuals. VCs, like partners in VC Firms, will reach out to me and say, "Hey Irina, I came across that. Our fund is investing and would you like to have some space in the round?" And that I think is - It's all about relationships. - greater for me versus many other private investors in the space. I'm very lucky in this way. So it's all about the relationships and it sounds like, again, the pro bono work that you're doing, and all these different experiences, and the values that you're exuding they're not about getting something in the short term. You think, you're saying I'm operating my life in the long term, and if I'm kind and if I'm helpful to others now, I'm not expecting anything in return. But you know, accumulatively over years, these relationships go both ways. And it's not just that they're helping me, they want me to be in a partnership with them because they know that my values are true and honest. Yeah. And oftentimes it doesn't come through, and I'm completely okay with that. Sometimes people just consume the piece of work I've done and then that's it. And you know what? I never have hard feelings about it because I know that I'm doing the right thing. And that is it. And the access to the most interesting, innovative company, to the COOs who need mentorship. Who need help. Who need introduction. And it's everything that I do is collaborative. Every single thing. I never just find a gem and says, "Okay. That is just for me. I hope nobody hears about it. I don't want to do any work for them because it would be free." No, I will tell about it and I will help. Sometimes I do work for the C for the company, employees, CEO, for years without even being an official adviser because that is how I can help my companies to gain value and to come to the next level of financing. Reaching the new audience that I am not a passive investor. And I think it's also, it helps me to get much better results than probably on average in the space. Amazing. Irina, what is it about languages that you love so much? How do you get to learn six languages? And what are those six, by the way? Well, my mother language, my mother tongue is Russian. And then obviously it's English. French. I was in Paris for a year, and I learned French literature and French language in Paris. And then I speak German. And that is my most recent language. I started learning Chinese back in 2006 or so. I am quite fluent in Mandarin. I speak Spanish fluently, which definitely helps. And I don't know, maybe I missed something but - Well next one needs to be Hebrew of course. Of course. But I love it because it breaks the barriers between me and other people and other cultures, and it makes my life richer because I can read, I can watch TV in whatever language, I can travel and I can talk to people and I am very people oriented. And I feel like my world is brighter and bigger and happier and than it would be otherwise. I love it. Irina, what is the one thing you're most passionate about? What gets you so excited every single morning when you wake up about the work that you do? About the work that I do? Yes, it is I feel like an individual have an opportunity to make a huge effect on the society at large, and I'm not talking about one country's society. It is we, I feel like I can I am making a difference. Whether it is from my volunteering work for the Amy Foundation. Or whether it is by mentoring somebody who brings a new way of popularizing something that was used to be available only to elite. Who bring in the medication, the new molecules that is gonna save lives and prevent suffering. From women suffering from breast cancers, from early diagnosis of the oral cancers. And it also make difference for the life of individual entrepreneurs who strive with their dreams or in their creative side, well everything is creative, but in the television arts for the young people out of Alabama Mississippi who want to be producers in Hollywood. You want to give them that chance. And when you can, by finding for them an internship in with one of the studios, you feel like that day was a good day. And it's just for them. It's all been nothing for me. But it feels more than anything else that I can receive in the form of payments, talk or something else. Irina, inspiring, inspiring. Right before we leave, I can't believe 20 minutes are already up. I need three words that best describe you. And I want to thank you for really the generous time, that you've given me here. So, that is a good question. So, number one will be decisive. So, I am capable of making decisions. So, that would be definitely. Passionate. Passionate will be the second one cause if I'm not passionate, I just don't do it. And the third would be I don't know why, but that's what people seem to differentiate me from others. I know no fear. So I'm absolutely fearless. There is no such a thing that somebody can scare me. It just doesn't work. Decisive. Passionate. Fearless. Irina, toda raba. Thank you very, very much. We didn't even talk about J-Ventures and how I love collaborating there but we'll leave that for another time. Thank you for everything. Really inspiring. Just thank you. Thank you. Thank you very, very much. And I hope to collaborate sometime soon with perhaps my own venture. Would love to. Please think of me when you're building something new. Thank you. Take care. Bye bye.
