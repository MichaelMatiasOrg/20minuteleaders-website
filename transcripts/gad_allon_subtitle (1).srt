1
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,560
Gad Allon, thank you for being on my show.

2
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,000
How are you?

3
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,920
Great. Great to be here.

4
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,880
So, we had a brief discussion just now.

5
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,240
It was phenomenal.

6
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,320
A little bit of static noise.

7
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,920
So, with the nature of the spontaneity

8
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,040
and covid, we're doing this.

9
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,560
Gad, a professor of operations,

10
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,480
information and decisions at UPENN,

11
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,000
director of the M&T program,

12
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,320
take me to the M&T program

13
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,280
and explain to me.

14
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,400
First of all, who is Gad Allon?

15
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,080
Walk me a little bit through your journey.

16
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,840
And then I'd love to understand

17
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,600
why you chose academia.

18
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,200
And you have a very special part

19
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,480
in academia where you have

20
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,000
both legs out in the real world

21
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,240
and both legs in academia.

22
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,560
Your whole work is in the integration

23
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,960
of all of these moving parts.

24
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,000
So, I'd love to talk about that as well.

25
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,120
But let's start with who is Gad

26
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,040
and transition towards the M&T program.

27
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,280
Yeah, absolutely.

28
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,040
And so, first of all, about myself,

29
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,000
originally from Israel.

30
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,840
So, you probably can hear from the accent

31
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,600
and from my name.

32
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,360
I was born there.

33
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,160
I was a self-taught software developer

34
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,640
from a fairly young age.

35
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,880
Worked when I was 16

36
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,080
with a fairly big project

37
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,840
within giant electronics at the time.

38
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,680
Worked with the several Israeli startups

39
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,520
from really in the area

40
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,920
of large scale databases.

41
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,280
And decided I don't want to be

42
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,080
in front of the computer

43
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,440
for the rest of my life.

44
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,000
Little did I know that all of us

45
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,760
are in front of the computer

46
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,000
for the rest of our life.

47
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,440
And I was in the military for a few years.

48
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:16,360
I was in elite unit as a soldier and officer

49
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,120
then decide that I don't want to do that.

50
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,880
I moved to the US.

51
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,360
Did my PhD at Columbia

52
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,160
in Decision, Risks and Operations.

53
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,440
We're doing game theory

54
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,800
and queuing theory.

55
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,120
And really, throughout my life

56
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,520
it was a combination of basically

57
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,600
everything I said until now.

58
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,160
So, worked with big firm:

59
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,760
Pepsi, John Deere, airlines.

60
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,800
But continuously also made sure

61
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,760
to stay in touch

62
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,360
with the more entrepreneurial world

63
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,000
and to work with the Israeli firms

64
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,040
or an American firms in very early stages.

65
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,440
Started my own firm while I was at Kellogg,

66
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,640
an education technology firm

67
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,400
that was acquired later on.

68
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,760
Continue to this day to invest in firms

69
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,960
and be on advisory boards of different firms

70
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,000
and always think about the next step.

71
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,400
But few years ago, I moved to PENN

72
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,280
to be the director of the M&T program

73
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,040
but I'll tell you more about it in a minute.

74
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,400
But in fact, what academia really allows you

75
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,040
that if you enjoy the ability

76
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,920
to go deep into an area

77
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,440
and then research that,

78
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,840
but at the same time

79
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,020
the ability to take that

80
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,160
and then apply it to firms,

81
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,880
and if you have the ability to move

82
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,600
between these two worlds in a fluid way,

83
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,440
and I think I managed to create

84
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,080
the flexibility to do that,

85
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,640
it's very hard to compete

86
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,840
with that type of a job.

87
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,840
It's like being in a kid in a candy store

88
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,280
because you can continuously pick up

89
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,840
what would be your next project.

90
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,840
At the same time,

91
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,000
you need to have the patience

92
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,760
to see some of these outcomes.

93
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,480
Right. So, I mean,

94
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,120
you were an entrepreneur until now.

95
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,520
And with an acquisition behind you

96
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,560
you worked with all these different firms.

97
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,000
It seems like the work that you're doing

98
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,720
is still very entrepreneurial also

99
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,000
within academia.

100
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,880
Because you're looking at our world,

101
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,440
and we'll talk about

102
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,600
the gig economy later,

103
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,640
but a lot of the insights

104
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,360
that you're bringing up

105
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,800
they're really trying to understand

106
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,280
how do consumers behave

107
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,920
and what type of solutions work

108
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,920
and what types of solutions don't work.

109
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,480
A lot of the same thought process

110
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,400
that entrepreneurs do,

111
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,160
and obviously, you also have the privilege

112
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,200
of impacting thousands of lives

113
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,360
through the different classes

114
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,880
that you teach, but specifically,

115
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,360
through the wonderful M&T program,

116
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,160
which I got to know

117
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,560
through my good friend Jake Goldman,

118
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,400
who is an alumni of that.

119
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,400
So, tell me a little bit about

120
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,080
what this is

121
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,920
and why you're helping run it?

122
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:21,360
Yeah. So, the M&T program is the oldest

123
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,600
coordinated degree program at Penn.

124
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
So, it's a coordinated dual degree that

125
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,280
the kids are getting a degree from Penn

126
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,200
and a degree,

127
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,920
so a degree from Penn Engineering

128
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,760
and from Wharton,

129
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,520
and whatever they want in engineering

130
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,720
and whatever they want at Wharton.

131
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,800
Right.

132
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,320
But ultimately if I want to explain

133
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,920
what M&T is about, I have to,

134
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,000
I mean, academia

135
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,200
so let me recommend a book.

136
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,120
The book is my favorite book

137
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,160
from last year,

138
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,760
called Range by David Epstein.

139
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,960
And he in fact started by comparing

140
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,920
Tiger Woods and Roger Federer.

141
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,040
And so, how is that related.

142
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,000
Well, Tiger Woods, most of us

143
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,440
are familiar with the fact that he

144
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,360
when he was really really young,

145
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,160
two years old already,

146
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,640
his father put him on the golf course

147
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,080
and said, "Play."

148
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,200
And that was the only focus.

149
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,160
When he was at Stanford

150
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,200
that's the only focus.

151
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,960
Only focus was golf.

152
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,280
Yeah.

153
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,080
Now, many parents, in fact,

154
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,400
built their entire educational endeavor

155
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,840
around that method.

156
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,720
He's actually talking about Roger Federer.

157
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,400
And Roger Federer is very different.

158
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,080
Roger Federer, while everybody knows,

159
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,840
of course, he's a good tennis player.

160
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,960
Well, he started tennis pretty late.

161
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,480
He was a skier, he was a soccer player,

162
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,720
he was a musician, a squash,

163
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,680
he was doing many many

164
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,360
many different things.

165
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,280
And in fact, his mother was a tennis coach

166
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,280
and she did not want to teach him golf,

167
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,880
coach him tennis.

168
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,080
Now, the story is that

169
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,640
if the world looked like a golf course

170
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,920
which means that like the Masters,

171
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,400
nothing changes to fears

172
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,560
then doing one thing since you're born

173
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,080
is the right way but different.

174
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,400
The world look more like a tennis game

175
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,960
where things are changing continuously

176
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,160
because there is an opponent

177
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,000
that is moving

178
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,880
and is improving their skills,

179
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,560
what equals a wicked wall then actually

180
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,960
being fluent in multiple skills.

181
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,760
Being able to do multiple things

182
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,960
at the same time is really

183
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,720
what you want to do.

184
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,400
And so, he's talking about

185
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,360
Copernicus and Van Gogh and many others

186
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,360
that actually are fashioned much more

187
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,120
on what Federer did, and in fact,

188
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,400
what M&T does.

189
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,720
Because M&T is really saying

190
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,080
you need to be someone

191
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,080
that can build products so you want people

192
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,280
that are very good engineers,

193
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,480
people that understand design,

194
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,040
but you also need people

195
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,040
that can motivate you and build teams,

196
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,080
can build culture.

197
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,200
And think at the level of an economy

198
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,000
and understand stakeholders.

199
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,120
And you need this kind of

200
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,520
right brain, left brain, IQ, EQ,

201
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,520
whatever you want to call that

202
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,680
to really make impact at scale.

203
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,680
And that's what like,

204
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,360
for M&T, I can talk about more about

205
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,640
because it's really beyond

206
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,400
just the program.

207
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,280
It's an amazing Alumni group.

208
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,240
And so, for example,

209
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,880
for many of our students,

210
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,000
the first job they got was from an alumni.

211
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,080
The first thing [--] was an alumni.

212
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,040
And when they come to campus

213
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,520
you have a really small cohort of students

214
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,840
that are continues to greet you,

215
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,440
but also you have an amazing Alumni group.

216
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,640
Look at the founder of StubHub

217
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,360
and Snapdeal in India,

218
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,760
and the guy that runs TMT for Goldman,

219
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,840
and the guy who run TMT for KKR,

220
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,400
and the guy who started AQR,

221
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,120
all of them are alums and all of them

222
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,800
have amazing access to our students

223
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,840
just willing to come to campus,

224
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,040
give of the office hours,

225
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,440
give students advice,

226
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,160
just an amazing access

227
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,560
that I think, does not exist really

228
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,120
in any other equivalent program.

229
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,480
And you mentioned before

230
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,280
that this is also

231
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,760
one of the most difficult programs

232
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,680
out of Penn

233
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,080
and they work extremely hard.

234
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,150
I can justify from watching Jake work

235
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,400
how hard they work.

236
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,400
But one thing that I was also very taken

237
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,720
was that when he was so kind

238
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,280
to walk me through the campus

239
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,600
and to get to the building

240
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,000
where the M&T cohort

241
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,720
works out of pre-covid times

242
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,160
and hopefully post-covid times.

243
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,360
And it's really it felt like an open space

244
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,560
of a melting pot of ideas with people

245
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,320
that are all passionate

246
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,880
about making change

247
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,320
and about innovating, right?

248
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,400
So, some of them, I'm guessing,

249
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,320
are a little bit more drawn

250
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,720
towards certain areas in engineering,

251
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,400
some of them a little more

252
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,440
towards finances or business.

253
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,080
But what they're sharing

254
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,200
and what you look for also

255
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,240
in the participants is this

256
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,800
yearning passion for making change

257
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,760
and for being leaders.

258
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,200
And it seems to me

259
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,600
that what you're referring to here,

260
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,680
the specialist versus the generalist,

261
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,080
to make impact at scale

262
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,520
and to really change understand

263
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,080
consumer behavior and move the needle,

264
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
you need to be more of a generalist, right?

265
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,680
Right, exactly. And so, to some extent,

266
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,840
what you see sometimes

267
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,040
people feel frustrated

268
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,120
by being a generalist.

269
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,440
And in fact, you do need to be

270
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,160
a specialist in something

271
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,680
to be able to make impact,

272
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,960
to have a path for yourself.

273
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,840
But to make impact at scale,

274
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,480
you need to be able to jump

275
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,480
between multiple worlds.

276
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,720
And it creates some frustration initially.

277
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,840
But in the long term,

278
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,520
it's a little bit like being a bilingual.

279
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,560
What I mean being bilingual means that

280
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,640
at least initially,

281
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,680
you're really not that good

282
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,000
in any one language.

283
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,160
And in the beginning

284
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,160
it's very frustrating.

285
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,880
But we all know that bilinguals

286
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,040
are much better

287
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,520
in almost everything they do

288
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,500
than people who have studied

289
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,400
much languages sequentially.

290
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,320
This is what we are talking about here.

291
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,440
Interesting. And obviously at the end

292
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,000
it's not to take that

293
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,560
they're stretching themselves thin

294
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,960
on either subject, I mean,

295
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,760
they're excelling

296
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,280
at both engineering school

297
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,240
and the business school.

298
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,080
It's not that they're giving

299
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,320
50 here, 50 here.

300
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,400
My my guess is that

301
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,320
usually they have pretty good grades

302
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,520
and usually they come up close

303
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,320
to the top of the class.

304
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,440
So, it seems a little bit natural.

305
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,480
But I'd also have to talk about

306
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,200
the workforce.

307
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,680
And you do interesting, fascinating,

308
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,560
remarkable research with the gig economy,

309
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,200
which is an economy

310
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,320
that I got introduced to

311
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,000
back in high school when I was running

312
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,200
a startup called AnyMeal.

313
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,280
And we had to understand

314
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,120
how can we get a lot of things done

315
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,000
and we didn't have the immediate resources

316
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,160
in my neighborhood for people to help.

317
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,720
And without knowing it,

318
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,160
I had friends all over the world

319
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,560
who on-boarded the organization

320
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,320
of the company,

321
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,760
and they were performing tasks

322
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,600
which I just didn't have

323
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,000
the expertise next to me.

324
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,080
So, talk to me a little bit about

325
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,280
what is the gig economy

326
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,920
and how is it changing a little bit

327
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,160
the mindset of what does it mean

328
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,560
to actually work?

329
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,600
Yeah, it's a great question.

330
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,880
So, first of all, we have to understand

331
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,480
the gig economy on the heels

332
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,520
of what it's being built.

333
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,800
And so, the reason,

334
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,160
I almost have to go back

335
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,520
to the introduction of firms.

336
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,360
Firms exist because of the fact that

337
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,440
what we call transaction cost economics.

338
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,040
It's very hard to manage

339
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,120
many subcontractors.

340
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,350
And that's why I want to be there

341
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,520
to [--] within the firm.

342
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,480
What has changed?

343
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,200
Multiple things.

344
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,360
First of all, mobility.

345
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,920
All of us have a device in our hands.

346
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,520
So, I can always find someone.

347
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,960
Second thing is data.

348
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,120
I always have the data and the ability

349
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,560
to understand who is in need

350
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,960
and who has the skill

351
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,160
and I can try to match them.

352
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,800
So what it means that

353
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,920
in the last few years,

354
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,520
and the names that you hear a lot

355
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,600
are of course, Uber and Lyft

356
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,400
and Jordache.

357
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,040
But these are the [--] entry.

358
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,920
The firms that I'm interested in

359
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,680
are firms like UpWork

360
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,480
and 99designs and HourlyNerds.

361
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,160
And then you get to firms that are

362
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,560
really taking whatever McKinsey

363
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,120
and BCG and Bain did and say,

364
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,960
in fact, their slogan was,

365
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,240
for HourlyNerd was,

366
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,240
"Why should you pay for the partners

367
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,640
second vacation [--]?"

368
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,280
We can renew the consulting.

369
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:20,960
There's a guy that does the work.

370
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,000
He'll bring you

371
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,160
and we'll charge you actually

372
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,080
only a fraction of that.

373
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,280
And so, that's the main thing,

374
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,040
rather than having all of these skills.

375
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,160
So, if I'm a firm

376
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,440
I can get into all of this.

377
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,160
If I'm the person

378
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,080
I need to design a website

379
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,400
I can find that person.

380
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,680
If I'm a person at these design,

381
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,280
and it's not from the demand side,

382
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,360
the supply side,

383
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,120
you have people that their skills

384
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,840
were very unique, too unique to niche.

385
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,040
There is no too niche now.

386
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,080
Why? Because there is someone

387
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,560
that has the need for your skills,

388
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,840
they will find it.

389
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,760
You will find in Facebook.

390
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,880
You will find somewhere.

391
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,320
And so the combination

392
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,720
of demand and supply

393
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,560
created essentially a world of abundance.

394
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,920
There is really no shortage

395
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,200
of people anymore in any specific skills.

396
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,240
What we need to do, however,

397
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,160
we need to build a platforms to help.

398
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,520
The matching process.

399
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,040
Exactly. That's what we see now.

400
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,120
What we call gig economy,

401
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,840
we talk about usually about this firm

402
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,040
that they're doing the matching

403
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,880
between the two.

404
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,120
And just to give you an idea,

405
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,280
we talk about around 2% of the US now

406
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,520
that making their

407
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,040
the majority of the income from the gig.

408
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,120
The majority?

409
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,640
The majority of the income.

410
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,800
We talk about the fact that

411
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,320
around 60 million people

412
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,440
had at least one encounter

413
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,800
where they got their income

414
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,440
from the gig economy.

415
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,480
We are talking about the fact that

416
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,760
it's going to increase

417
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,960
in the next five years, the GDP,

418
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,800
by around 3.5 trillion dollars.

419
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,120
So, we're seeing here that

420
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,440
you have over 30% of the workforce

421
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,400
just in the US who has experienced

422
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,200
receiving compensation for a gig job.

423
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,400
And here, we say gig interchangeably

424
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,040
but this could be that you're

425
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,480
in the ridesharing service

426
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,120
and you're not tied to one firm.

427
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,000
You can go on to multiple firms, right?

428
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,520
And we see that, of course.

429
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,280
Or it can be that you're on a firm

430
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,640
like UpWork or 99designs.

431
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,600
And I have to say, the one thing

432
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,040
that truly excites me is that obviously,

433
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,960
on our side, as perhaps the clients,

434
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,600
we are able to get things done quicker,

435
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,240
more efficiently.

436
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,160
But on the other end,

437
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,360
this two sided marketplace

438
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,280
it excites me that all of a sudden

439
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,520
people all over the world,

440
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,360
not just in the US,

441
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,560
but people have

442
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,760
these new opportunities

443
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,000
that they never had before.

444
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,800
Access to Internet,

445
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,480
whether it's a mobile or computer,

446
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,320
now allows anybody in the Philippines

447
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,640
to become a book editor

448
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,320
or to become an illustrator

449
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,600
for a book written by

450
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,840
a 24 year old in Palo Alto.

451
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,600
So, it's really incredible opportunity.

452
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,000
And it's mind boggling

453
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,520
how fast it's growing.

454
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,200
Right, exactly.

455
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,680
And so, that's exactly what you see.

456
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,040
We see more and more

457
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,600
labor arbitrage on one side,

458
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,040
that's one way to think about it.

459
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,560
Another way is that

460
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,240
people have much more freedom

461
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,480
to actually maintain careers

462
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,560
in an area that in the past

463
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,440
is very hard to maintain, in location that

464
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,200
in the past is very hard to maintain.

465
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,360
That's exactly what we see now.

466
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,560
But you do a very interesting research

467
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,160
on exactly that question

468
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,760
that those decisions

469
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,920
that a lot of these people

470
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,760
are having to make.

471
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,000
One of the things that

472
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,920
I love to talk about is

473
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,880
what motivates people, right?

474
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,360
So, both in terms of what does it mean

475
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,920
to be a gig worker, but then,

476
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,160
what are the different factors

477
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,840
that either contribute or lack thereof

478
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,840
towards their motivation to work?

479
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,800
Yes, that's a great question.

480
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,680
So, first of all, from the outside,

481
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,200
what motivates them is really,

482
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,720
the majority of them, actually in fact,

483
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,080
don't start with that as the job.

484
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,480
They start just a supplement

485
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,880
and then they see it actually offer them

486
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,480
a lot of flexibility, which is really

487
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,280
the main reason most of them are there.

488
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,960
The majority is the fact that

489
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,160
they have flexibility

490
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,280
they never had before.

491
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,840
But now we want to go into the micro.

492
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,280
And ultimately, the interesting thing

493
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,480
about this economy is that

494
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,640
if you think about the current economy,

495
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,200
most of us make decisions

496
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,720
on where to work once a year.

497
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,920
Once in seven year if you're in academia.

498
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,320
Once in every, maybe once you get tenure,

499
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,360
that's your last decision.

500
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,720
People here make decisions,

501
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,640
where, how long and what has to take

502
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,080
minute by minute.

503
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,680
The question we started with was,

504
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,120
Should we start and develop

505
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,160
a whole new labor economy?

506
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,480
Because you hear a lot of debate

507
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,440
on the policy side,

508
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,760
and what preference you optimize.

509
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,400
And so we had to, first of all,

510
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,440
see what are the main assumptions

511
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:24,960
we need to make,

512
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,880
what are the main ideas we need to see

513
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,960
when we look at how these people

514
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,600
make decisions.

515
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,480
And so, we got data

516
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,560
from a ridesharing firm

517
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,760
on each transaction they had

518
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,880
for a whole year.

519
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,400
Every offer that was made,

520
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,640
every job that was taken,

521
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,960
everything, everything, everything

522
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,400
for a whole year.

523
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,240
And we look really at three factors.

524
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,480
We look at what's the impact of income,

525
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,720
the offer, basically the wage.

526
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,600
It's not really a wage,

527
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,320
but the equivalent of wage.

528
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:49,760
Right.

529
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,400
If people are rational,

530
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,080
that's the only thing that should matter.

531
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,680
And the first thing we saw is that

532
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,280
actually that matters and matters a lot.

533
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,180
Which really means that

534
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,600
most of these drivers, in this case,

535
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,320
drivers are highly rational.

536
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,880
I'm saying that because you hear a lot

537
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,560
of journalistic approach, let's say that

538
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,760
you need to protect these people

539
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,800
and they're not rational,

540
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,920
they're captured.

541
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,080
And in fact, most of them

542
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,800
are very rational.

543
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,720
Wages go up, they go more.

544
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,640
Wages go down,

545
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,760
they actually drive less.

546
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,840
There was a bit of a noise there.

547
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,120
Can you just go back and re-state

548
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,240
what did you find,

549
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,320
are the drivers rational or not and why?

550
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,640
Why do you think that they are?

551
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,600
Yes. Let me actually, first of all,

552
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,000
outlined the three main factors

553
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,560
we looked at.

554
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,400
We looked at, first of all,

555
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,040
the impact of earnings.

556
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,720
So, whether the higher the wage offer,

557
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,080
because these drivers get an offer,

558
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,320
base on that firm.

559
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,760
And the question was,

560
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,800
everything else being equal,

561
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,680
if the offer has become higher

562
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,360
are they more likely to accept the job

563
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,840
and work longer?

564
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,840
And the answer was yes.

565
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,960
Not surprising.

566
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,880
Not surprising.

567
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,440
Surprising for some people, I should say.

568
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,200
Because there are a lot of research

569
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,800
from the 90s on a taxi driver,

570
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,880
where they chose the opposite.

571
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,440
That the more you pay them,

572
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,000
actually, the less they work.

573
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,520
So we shall know.

574
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,720
But the second thing that was interesting,

575
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,960
actually, we look at

576
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,640
how much people earned until now

577
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,800
and we saw that the people,

578
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,240
the more they earned until now,

579
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,560
the less likely they continue to work,

580
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,160
and the fewer hours they work

581
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,120
if they continue to work.

582
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,000
So, again, the more they earn

583
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,320
until now, the less likely

584
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,350
they're going to continue to do.

585
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,840
Do you explain that because

586
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,960
they have a bucket of expectation

587
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,400
in their mind

588
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,400
and they're reaching the top

589
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,960
of that expectation?

590
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,120
Yeah. I mean, that's the main explanation.

591
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,360
The main explanation what we see

592
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,760
is income targeting.

593
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,120
No one has the dream of driving for Uber.

594
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,840
You want to drive for Uber

595
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,360
only to the extent it allows you

596
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,880
to get a certain level and now,

597
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,920
you can go and play with your kids.

598
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,760
But here comes probably

599
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,840
the more interesting result.

600
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,200
The last result was to look at

601
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,960
what's the impact of the hours

602
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,000
they work until now

603
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,320
on the likelihood to continue to work.

604
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,960
And here, we saw a very interesting result

605
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,960
because the more hours they worked

606
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,720
for that specific firm,

607
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,400
the more likely they are to continue

608
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,360
and work for that firm

609
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,360
and the longer hours they continue.

610
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,400
And I should say this is within a driver

611
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,520
so it's not the cross driver,

612
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,760
within the same driver

613
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,960
take multiple days,

614
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,800
a day in which you work longer

615
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,640
up to that point

616
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,960
is more likely to continue

617
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,600
and go to work longer.

618
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,360
And that is surprising.

619
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,080
That's very surprising.

620
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,000
That's the first indication

621
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,560
in the literature of that behavior.

622
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,720
And we call it inertia.

623
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,880
And our explanation for that, by the way,

624
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,480
is that while these drivers are looking

625
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,080
for flexibility,

626
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,560
they also like within that flexibility

627
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,120
they like the ability to maintain

628
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,640
a certain schedule

629
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,440
or a certain level of consistency.

630
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,560
Now, why is it interesting?

631
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,840
I just think primarily because

632
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,840
of the significant implications for policy,

633
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,160
for example, because these drivers are,

634
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,880
we know that with people,

635
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,280
unlike with our many activities

636
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,000
we do in life

637
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,040
where we're the only one

638
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,120
impacting ourselves.

639
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,880
Here, when you put someone on the road

640
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,280
and they want the longer

641
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,760
they'd driven until now

642
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,520
they're going to drive even longer,

643
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,720
now these are posing risk to other people.

644
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,680
And in here what I see is actually

645
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,960
interesting regulation in New York,

646
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,000
but really try to monitor the same drivers

647
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,200
across multiple firms

648
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,600
and trying to understand

649
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,600
how do we protect society from people

650
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,360
where they can actually harm

651
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,400
not only themselves,

652
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,080
which is bad to begin with,

653
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,600
but actually harm society of all.

654
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,880
And of course,

655
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,240
there is a conflict of interest

656
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,560
because a lot of these firms,

657
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,720
they have an incentive to keep

658
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,800
as many drivers on the road

659
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,040
at any given moment.

660
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,240
Because that gives me a better experience

661
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,080
because I have a match

662
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,120
within a minute, right?

663
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,200
I'm curious, do you think

664
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,600
that is a similar behavior

665
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,640
exhibited by gig workers

666
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,160
in other industries?

667
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,960
Or is that primarily a thing

668
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,520
for mobility?

669
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,240
That's a great question.

670
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,320
That's what we're trying to understand now.

671
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,440
But I'll say one thing, however,

672
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,080
from what you said.

673
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,520
I don't think the firm always

674
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,680
would like to keep drivers driving.

675
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,680
I think the firms,

676
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,300
in fact, when I speak with firm,

677
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,320
with people in these firms,

678
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,120
and that's not across the board,

679
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,800
they would like people to be on the road

680
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,760
when there is work and they prefer

681
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,280
that they be home when there is no work.

682
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,160
They believe that they actually pay,

683
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:07,640
Exactly.

684
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,760
They actually believe they pay in goodwill

685
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,400
if these drivers are going around

686
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,280
looking for jobs and there is no job.

687
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,520
So, predicting behavior is actually

688
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,200
really really  a key for them.

689
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,200
This is fascinating.

690
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,480
What other things,

691
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,240
because the gig workers is something

692
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,440
that's been your recent endeavor, right?

693
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,960
But you've done more research

694
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,520
across the years.

695
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,080
So, what are some other

696
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,360
really interesting questions

697
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,600
that you've been asking yourself

698
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,160
throughout this research that are relevant

699
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,000
to the world of entrepreneurship?

700
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,600
Yeah. So, one area

701
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,600
that I've been dealing with

702
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,800
quite a bit in the last few years

703
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,520
is how people process information.

704
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,800
And let me explain what I mean by that.

705
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,320
We are in an era where

706
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,720
more than any time in history,

707
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,480
we have more information in our hands

708
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,080
and in fact, we see people

709
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:54,480
potentially know less about the world

710
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,280
than we know in the past.

711
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,280
And so, that's not where we started.

712
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,400
We started, I would say, in a world

713
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,960
where people have more information,

714
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,320
but this information is coming

715
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,440
in a very high speed

716
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,320
and a very very small chance.

717
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,000
When I talk about that

718
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:04,920
I'm really talking about this.

719
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,400
The fact that information has

720
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,440
the size of the screen,

721
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,760
and within the screen,

722
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,840
we have very little time

723
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,680
to decide what we read

724
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,560
and we move on and now

725
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,480
there is a new flow of information.

726
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,560
So, we look at that situation

727
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,840
and we say in a world like that,

728
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,760
where also the information sources

729
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,760
are more and more unknown.

730
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,360
I mean, I think about the world that

731
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,360
I was born to.

732
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,640
The world I was born to

733
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,960
we had two newspapers,

734
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,200
in the US it was The New York Times

735
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,000
and The Washington Post.

736
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,920
[--].

737
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,560
In Israel we're different.

738
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,320
You had one or two TV channels,

739
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,800
maybe three, now, we don't talk about

740
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,640
The New York Times anymore.

741
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,520
We talk about this [--].

742
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,800
Or is it someone in the army,

743
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,280
each and every source now

744
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,040
is a different source.

745
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,160
If you look at covid,

746
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:47,800
many of the people

747
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,240
that actually brought covid

748
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,760
into attention were not even

749
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,680
from the main journals.

750
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,760
Many of them were actually site players.

751
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,520
So, the question we are looking at

752
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,640
is a situation where you look at the data

753
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,480
and one of the things we show, in fact,

754
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,560
is that because of the fact that

755
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,240
we have proliferation of sources

756
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,400
that are in themselves

757
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,720
are not very credible,

758
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,720
when I said not credible,

759
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,600
some of them are credible.

760
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,360
I'm not talking about fake news, by the way,

761
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,240
I'm talking about really the fact

762
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,760
that we are trying to assess

763
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,040
the level of information

764
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:17,880
in the same time

765
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,200
that we're trying to figure out

766
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,560
what is really the truth.

767
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,560
If we do that, what we get

768
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,800
we get to see that it's actually

769
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,240
highly polarized world.

770
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,240
And then why we get

771
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,480
to highly polarized world?

772
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,280
Because when I evaluate information

773
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,920
I want to evaluate from wherever I am.

774
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,760
I would evaluate

775
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,480
given the information I have

776
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,160
and if the information

777
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,360
is already polarized,

778
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,240
it would become even more

779
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,360
and more polarized.

780
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,320
The reason it's interesting for me is that

781
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,720
we live in a world of platforms

782
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,920
and what we can think about

783
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,320
is how do we regulate many of them.

784
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,920
But what we are trying to show, in fact,

785
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,440
is that regulation,

786
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,080
unless you really understand

787
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,440
why we see what we see,

788
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,480
we might actually regulate

789
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,840
the wrong side of innovation.

790
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,080
And that's why I'm worried about them.

791
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,240
I'm worried about that we tend

792
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,920
not to think about the [--].

793
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,800
We tend to not think about

794
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,480
the implications of regulation,

795
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,240
without truly understanding

796
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,360
how people make decisions.

797
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,360
What is the drivers,

798
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,600
what it is about and use sources,

799
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,120
whether whatever it is about.

800
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,840
And so, that's an overarching theme

801
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,200
of what I'm trying to do.

802
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,640
And as you can see, many of that

803
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,960
is really talking about things

804
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,160
that have changed the last few years

805
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,400
with a lot of this impacted

806
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,440
by current changes in technology

807
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,840
and in the way we consume information.

808
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,160
In just a minute,

809
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,160
why Professor, why teach?

810
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,520
Why stand in front of classrooms?

811
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,360
Sometimes dozens,

812
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,680
sometimes hundreds of students.

813
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,200
And talk about these things

814
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,720
that you're researching?

815
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,000
Yeah.

816
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:41,880
So, that's a great question.

817
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,080
And in fact, I had the faculty

818
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,800
at the Technion,  Avi Mandelbaum, that said

819
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,720
whenever you do anything,

820
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,320
you have to think about

821
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,040
what is your scope of impact.

822
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,360
When you do consulting,

823
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,960
it's five minutes from now.

824
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,760
When you teach executive MBA students,

825
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,720
it's a year from now.

826
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,200
When you teach undergrad,

827
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,120
MBA is five years from now.

828
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:02,760
When you teach undergrad,

829
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,400
it's 25 years from now.

830
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,600
Many of them are it's too early

831
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,640
for them to impact at now.

832
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,920
But by yourself,

833
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,440
if you teach them things that have,

834
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,520
not only about what you teach,

835
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,560
it's also teaching them how to think of--

836
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,120
Impact, MBA five years from now.

837
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,240
But undergraduate, 25 years from now.

838
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,360
Yeah. And then research,

839
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,040
75 years from now, right?

840
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,640
You want to teach people how to think

841
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,800
not only [--].

842
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,040
You want to teach them the way

843
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,760
and in fact, that impact

844
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,600
is very very hard to have any other way.

845
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,600
And so, I enjoyed being in the classroom.

846
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,680
I love being in the classroom.

847
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,040
A many of my students,

848
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,160
I'm still in touch with them.

849
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,320
In fact, almost every week

850
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,440
I speak with two three students,

851
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,640
former students who work very hard

852
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,920
to replicate this experience.

853
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,840
Unbelievable. Gad, before we leave,

854
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,880
I want to thank you again for being

855
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,200
so generous with your time.

856
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,120
And this is just wonderful and insightful.

857
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,920
And I love watching the different lectures

858
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:37,840
that you have in YouTube.

859
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,840
And I urge anybody

860
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,360
who is remotely interested

861
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,320
in any of these questions

862
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,080
that you're asking yourself,

863
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:42,800
which I'm sure,

864
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,120
every young entrepreneur is

865
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,880
because the labor force

866
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:49,360
and decision making and operations

867
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,880
and processing information is,

868
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,520
that's what 2020 is about.

869
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,080
And, of course, moving forward.

870
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:55,720
But before we leave,

871
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,920
I have to ask you for three words

872
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,560
that you would use to describe yourself.

873
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:58,840
Yeah.

874
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,000
So, I'll say, first of all, integrity.

875
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,760
I believe in integrative thinking.

876
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,080
I try to integrate many things rigourous.

877
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,400
I try to go as deep as I can

878
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,440
to every topic I take and very direct.

879
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,280
My students know

880
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,100
that I'm very direct in everything I say,

881
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,760
both positive and negative.

882
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,280
Michael, great to be here.

883
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,160
I love it.

884
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,420
Gad, thank you very very much.

885
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:18,370
Toda raba.

886
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,720
This is just wonderful.

887
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:20,200
Take care.

888
00:51:20,360 --> 00:53:06,880
Take care.
