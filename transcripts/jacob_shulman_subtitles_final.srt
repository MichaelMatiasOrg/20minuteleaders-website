00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,920
Jacob Shulman, thank you

2
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,080
for being on 20 Minute Leaders.

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,200
Hi Michael, very nice being here.

4
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,240
I am so excited to learn about

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,200
what it means to be the CFO

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,880
of multiple companies,

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,360
very very well-known companies,

8
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,800
Mellanox, JFrog most recently,

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,640
an incredible company

10
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,750
here in Silicon Valley.

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,440
And I'm especially curious to hear

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,200
and to learn as a young entrepreneur,

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,790
what are the responsibilities

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,960
and the different mindsets

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,720
that one needs to come with when working

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,520
as the chief financial officer,

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,480
because I don't know finances.

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,800
I don't know what that even entails.

19
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,880
You raised over $750 million in capital.

20
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,160
You've managed or and you've seen

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,440
over $1.5 billion in acquisitions.

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,120
I mean these are just

23
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,200
astonishing numbers.

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,880
Jacob, let's just start.

25
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,520
Who are you?

26
00:01:09,521 --> 00:01:14,240
I don't know. Looks like I'm a simple guy

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,760
that trying to achieve my dream career

28
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,280
and enjoy all the way through it.

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,880
So what is that dream career

30
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,840
that you're talking about?

31
00:01:25,841 --> 00:01:29,240
I always wanted to be involved in business

32
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:32,960
and work along

33
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:34,960
very bright entrepreneurs,

34
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:38,800
helping them to achieve their goals.

35
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,800
My background is in finance

36
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,480
and I enjoy that side of the business.

37
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,880
As you know, entrepreneurs many time they,

38
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,640
technology is, they're very bright guys,

39
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,720
but they less, let's say,

40
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:55,000
knowledgeable in finance

41
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,040
and scalability.

42
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,680
How to run the businesses

43
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,240
and back offices of corporations.

44
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,680
Right. I mean

45
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:02,160
when I think about entrepreneurs,

46
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,640
I think of these crazy people

47
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,120
who run up and down the hallway

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,880
screaming about the strategy

49
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,400
and what we should be doing

50
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,960
but they're not necessarily connected

51
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,520
to the financial spreadsheets

52
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:13,800
that it takes to then run

53
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,760
a successful business

54
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,080
that can raise capital through the rounds.

55
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,560
It's not just financial spreadsheets.

56
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,240
It's entire back office, right?

57
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,240
How to build a scalable processes.

58
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:27,120
How to consider different decisions.

59
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,760
Would it make sense to raise capital now?

60
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,960
Or maybe wait until the product is ready

61
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,640
and raise later

62
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,960
at a higher valuation?

63
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,680
All of this decision that

64
00:02:36,681 --> 00:02:39,320
I'm helping them to take.

65
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,000
So, yeah, because I think that

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,080
one of the interesting phenomena

67
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,080
that I'm observing is that

68
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,400
the millions of dollars that people

69
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,440
are talking about in venture funding,

70
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,640
it's almost become

71
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,160
like just meaningless numbers.

72
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,720
Like yeah, I raised six million.

73
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,280
Oh, maybe I could raise 10 million.

74
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:56,240
And you're talking about

75
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,760
the different finances of a company,

76
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,720
and it almost seems to lose the meaning

77
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,800
of what is that money actually

78
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,480
being used for.

79
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,200
So it sounds like,

80
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:05,080
is your position really understanding

81
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,200
the core of the company

82
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,640
and understanding how much money

83
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,240
we actually need

84
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,640
and how are we actually going to use it?

85
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,400
Yes, absolutely.

86
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,080
So first of all, what's our needs, right?

87
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,400
Right.

88
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,120
What runway we want to get.

89
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,360
But also what our core business

90
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,840
and what value we could get

91
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,760
for that business, right?

92
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,760
Yes, many times it's valuation

93
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,440
it's very subjective.

94
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,400
But at the end,

95
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,400
there are some substantial business

96
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,960
behind that, right.

97
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,800
So how do you combine these

98
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,320
to your needs, your valuation,

99
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,600
and what's true business behind that?

100
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,120
This is something that I help.

101
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,560
So, give me the day to day of a CFO.

102
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,320
I'm observing.

103
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,200
I talk to a lot of founders

104
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,760
and entrepreneurs

105
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,680
and I see how they operate,

106
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,800
but I've never really shadowed a CFO

107
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:54,280
of a huge company

108
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,640
like Mellanox or JFrogs.

109
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,800
Share with me.

110
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,400
You come to the office in the morning,

111
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,520
what do you care about?

112
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,880
What keeps you up at night?

113
00:04:01,881 --> 00:04:04,040
First of all, when I wake up,

114
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,280
first thing is to check

115
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:09,640
how the futures of the market look...

116
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,800
To see what's gonna happen today

117
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,160
in the market.

118
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,960
And especially if you see

119
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:16,160
... a public company.

120
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,040
Many times a company's shares move

121
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,560
irrespective of the company business.

122
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:25,240
Different drivers behind the share price.

123
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:26,200
But at the end,

124
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:28,840
every employee of public company,

125
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,600
when they come to work,

126
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,320
they open the ... finance and they see,

127
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,560
"Okay, uh-oh, what's going on

128
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,240
with the company?

129
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,120
The company's share is

130
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,840
down five percent, up five percent" Right.

131
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,360
Is that a big thing?

132
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,040
When you're an executive

133
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,760
in a public company that you go

134
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,720
and you are constantly checking

135
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:45,520
Yahoo Finance to see

136
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,600
what the stock price is?

137
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:48,040
Not constantly checking,

138
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,040
but you do want to have an idea

139
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,480
what's going on today in the market

140
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,240
because many times investors might call

141
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,120
if it's a significant movement

142
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,360
in the stock, right

143
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,120
So if the stock,

144
00:05:00,121 --> 00:05:01,520
what's a significant movement

145
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,680
for example?

146
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,400
I'd say more than five percent.

147
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,760
People would want to understand why.

148
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,320
What's the reasons for that, right?

149
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,320
And especially,

150
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,120
if you have a very good relationship

151
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,440
with investors,

152
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,600
they might call you and ask,

153
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,560
"Hey, what's going on with the company?"

154
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,000
Right?

155
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,720
What is it that's triggering?

156
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,760
What are the trigger in this movement

157
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,720
in the stock?

158
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,480
So, you could come to the office

159
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,040
and you see like there's a five percent

160
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,000
increase or decrease

161
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:28,720
and you just get a phone call and say,

162
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:31,560
"Hey, I saw we just lost

163
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,360
a few billion dollars here.

164
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,200
Can you explain, like,

165
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,080
is there anything wrong?"

166
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,800
Yeah. So, many times you know

167
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,760
different investors,

168
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,040
they look at the time horizon.

169
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,640
Time horizon is different.

170
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,840
Some guys, they don't really

171
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:47,120
they don't care about daily movements

172
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,160
because they invest for the long term.

173
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:50,880
And some guys

174
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,960
they have much shorter view.

175
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,800
So, this is obviously the way

176
00:05:57,801 --> 00:05:59,880
how you choose investors in your business.

177
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:01,440
Who you contacted.

178
00:06:01,441 --> 00:06:02,920
What investors you target.

179
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,400
That's very important.

180
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:04,840
So, Jacob,

181
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,840
what is your biggest contribution

182
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,880
to the company?

183
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,720
So, as the CFO,

184
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:12,240
what is the top three things

185
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,160
that you provide that without you

186
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,680
the company would not be able to continue

187
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,360
as it's doing today?

188
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:21,360
So, first of all, I think my primary role

189
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,640
is to help the CEO of the company

190
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,000
to understand

191
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,000
where we stand with our financials,

192
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,240
what's the true performance

193
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,160
of our business,

194
00:06:30,161 --> 00:06:32,040
and what investments,

195
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,880
additional investments,

196
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,080
we can allow ourselves

197
00:06:34,081 --> 00:06:36,960
to make to grow the business,

198
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,640
and what are those areas

199
00:06:38,641 --> 00:06:39,640
where we could invest

200
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:42,200
to help, to get the best ROI.

201
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,080
That's I think, that's the primary role

202
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,120
because, as you know,

203
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,160
CEOs they're very busy people.

204
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,680
They drive the product,

205
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,640
they drive marketing,

206
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,520
they try to close deals.

207
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,520
And many times

208
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,640
they don't have time and capacity

209
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,000
to have that view.

210
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,800
So that's what my primary role.

211
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,200
Second, I obviously help a lot with

212
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,400
running the back office of the company.

213
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:09,640
The company, when you run

214
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,440
the company, a lot of law

215
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,280
that you have to comply with.

216
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:17,760
There is different regulations, etc.

217
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,400
This is something

218
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,720
that I help with as well,

219
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,160
because I want the business side,

220
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,920
the CEO to focus on the business.

221
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,200
Right.

222
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,840
Those are my main areas.

223
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:34,640
And obviously being the,

224
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,000
contacting major stakeholders

225
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,200
such as investors and all of that stuff.

226
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,840
So, that's the governance side

227
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,480
of the company

228
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,280
and this is something also

229
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,880
that I'm helping with.

230
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
How connected are you

231
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,760
to the mission of the company?

232
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,640
So, how connected are you

233
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,960
to the mission of Mellanox?

234
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,200
To the mission of JFrog?

235
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:54,080
Rather than the financial projections

236
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,240
of where the company could get to?

237
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,520
And I'm talking, when I say mission,

238
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,240
I'm talking about, you know,

239
00:07:58,241 --> 00:08:00,080
Google's mission is to connect

240
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,640
to the world's information.

241
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,360
Like those types of missions.

242
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,400
Are you there with the executive teams?

243
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,300
Of course. Of course.

244
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,840
This is, as executive in the company,

245
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,600
you have to believe

246
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,440
in the mission of the company.

247
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,080
You have to, otherwise

248
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,400
there's no place for you

249
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,120
in the company.

250
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,280
If you don't believe in the mission,

251
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,520
you're a leader in the company.

252
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,400
Right.

253
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,960
It's not just you accountant, and seeds,

254
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,640
and calculates income and expenses.

255
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,080
No, not at all.

256
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,280
You're a leader in the company,

257
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,080
you drive the company forward

258
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,320
and if you don't believe in the mission,

259
00:08:29,321 --> 00:08:31,280
or far away from

260
00:08:31,281 --> 00:08:32,400
understanding the mission,

261
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,960
then there's no way for you

262
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:35,160
you have to be in the company.

263
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:36,280
Totally. Totally.

264
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,320
Okay. So, talk to me a little bit about

265
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,640
why you enjoy being the CFO

266
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,080
I am a numbers guy

267
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,040
but I'm not a huge economics guy.

268
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,360
I am much more, I think, in the realm of

269
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,840
the engineering side of things.

270
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,320
Why CFO? Why leading

271
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,200
the financials of the companies?

272
00:08:56,201 --> 00:09:00,400
First of all, I think my background

273
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,560
fits me very well for this position

274
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,760
but this is something that

275
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,720
I always was attracted to.

276
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,960
The financial side, right.

277
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:13,400
The investment side, the ROI.

278
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:16,680
I'm less maybe creative

279
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,600
on the engineering side,

280
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,400
although I do have

281
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,760
some engineering background.

282
00:09:19,761 --> 00:09:22,520
But, with time

283
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,520
I develop these capabilities

284
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,000
of truly understanding

285
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,200
the financial future of the company.

286
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,360
For me just to take a look

287
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,160
at the financials,

288
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,600
I know what's going on right away.

289
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:33,800
Right?

290
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,920
So, this is something that I enjoy.

291
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:36,560
And this is something

292
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,720
that I feel comfortable with

293
00:09:38,721 --> 00:09:42,040
to read that side of the business.

294
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,320
Are those similar lessons

295
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,360
and understandings

296
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,960
as what investors need

297
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,240
in order to invest Series B onwards

298
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,760
as you're able to actually look

299
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,440
at the details of the numbers?

300
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,200
Obviously investors in public companies

301
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:59,400
and VC investors,

302
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,560
they're completely different considerations

303
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,440
that they make.

304
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,720
When a public company investors

305
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,400
reviews the financials,

306
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,040
they typically could value the company

307
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,080
on certain history

308
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,960
of the company performance, right?

309
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,440
Financial performance.

310
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,400
VC investors

311
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,360
they many times

312
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,480
they don't even have

313
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:20,800
any history of the company, right

314
00:10:20,801 --> 00:10:24,520
Investors, VC investors they many time

315
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,280
just invest into the idea,

316
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,240
and into the entrepreneur,

317
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,200
versus the public investors

318
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,400
where they typically invest

319
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,440
into the business,

320
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,720
already established business,

321
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,080
Comparing how they performed.

322
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,880
Comparing their success in the market

323
00:10:39,881 --> 00:10:41,840
and then projecting what will be

324
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,400
their future success.

325
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,600
That makes a lot of sense.

326
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,600
And, I still wanna know the

327
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,640
you're seeing the companies grow.

328
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,480
What is the most fun thing you take away

329
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,640
from seeing these companies grow?

330
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,280
Is it more of the early stages,

331
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,120
the later stages?

332
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,800
'cause most of your experience is

333
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,040
in the later stages, right?

334
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,520
I joined Mellanox when they were just

335
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,120
$50 million in revenues.

336
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,240
Wow.

337
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,520
And I saw this growth.

338
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,080
When I left Mellanox, they were over

339
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,720
a billion dollar in revenues,

340
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,360
and 3,000 employes.

341
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,640
So, obviously I saw that growth.

342
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,880
And it's obviously at different stages,

343
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:24,960
you have to deal with different issues.

344
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,280
Right?

345
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,400
When it's smaller company,

346
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,760
less established company,

347
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,960
you really try to penetrate

348
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,440
into the market.

349
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,600
To build those processes

350
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,320
that allow to scale fast

351
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,000
if you're successful.

352
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:42,040
When you're a large company, you deal with a lot

353
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,760
with management of the company.

354
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,280
Coordination.

355
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,160
Maybe acquiring other companies and

356
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,440
integrating them into the business.

357
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,800
So, it's at different stages

358
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:56,800
you have different needs.

359
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,040
So, and as you're going

360
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,480
through these different companies

361
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,320
and different incredible experiences,

362
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,400
what are some of the patterns

363
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,680
that you're seeing in terms of

364
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:08,160
healthy ways of running finances?

365
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,440
There maybe unhealthy ways of doing that.

366
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,320
I mean, things that I could take with me

367
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,920
as an entrepreneur moving forward

368
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,280
when I run my own business.

369
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,760
What are the most critical things

370
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,560
I should keep in mind besides

371
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,440
bringing on a very very good CFO?

372
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,920
Critical things is, first of all,

373
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,920
it's all about people, right?

374
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,480
People you work with,

375
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,920
the integrity of your CEO.

376
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,360
I would never want to work

377
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,600
with someone who does some shady deals

378
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,480
or anything like that.

379
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,320
So, integrity is a big part of it.

380
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,680
It's honesty and integrity.

381
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,840
That's very important

382
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,080
because we all come to work to enjoy,

383
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,240
and I don't want to have sleepless nights

384
00:12:47,241 --> 00:12:50,400
just thinking what might happen, right,

385
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,040
if my partners decide,

386
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,560
"Hey, maybe we'll do cut that corner

387
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,320
or that corner."

388
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,800
No. No. No.

389
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,640
So, this is all about people first.

390
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:07,200
And second, obviously,

391
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:10,920
truly, I enjoy working

392
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,320
with true professionals, right,

393
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,280
they're passionate about their business.

394
00:13:14,281 --> 00:13:19,600
Totally. As a CEO or as an entrepreneur,

395
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,400
does the CFO, will the same person

396
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,360
usually fit the role as the company grows?

397
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,440
Because I imagine that

398
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,120
you probably would get a CFO, I guess,

399
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,840
when you're, I don't know,

400
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,400
Series B, maybe, in the company?

401
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,120
And then you're growing and you eventually

402
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,680
you're gonna go public, hopefully.

403
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,080
And you're gonna have perhaps

404
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,560
a billion dollars in revenue.

405
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,880
That's a very different

406
00:13:40,881 --> 00:13:43,560
transactional amount

407
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,120
from raising $30 million to getting now,

408
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,600
to getting a $100 million a year.

409
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,160
Is it usually the same person

410
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,120
who can handle both?

411
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,480
Or do you usually see people

412
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,080
shifting, changing CFOs?

413
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,880
It depends. It depends on the person.

414
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,520
Many people just enjoy working

415
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,600
with smaller companies,

416
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,800
and when the company

417
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,680
reaches a certain level,

418
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:09,520
then they just decide to leave

419
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,960
and go back to smaller companies.

420
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,200
Same true for other guys

421
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:17,880
who enjoy working for big companies.

422
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,000
There are some people like me

423
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:20,800
enjoy to see

424
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,440
all the way through grow, right

425
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,680
And many times you just

426
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,880
grow with the company

427
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,880
and you use a lot of common sense.

428
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,160
Totally. Totally.

429
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:31,760
Talk to me a little bit

430
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,520
about this idea of seeing big growth

431
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,240
as a strategy versus getting bottled up

432
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,440
in the current finances.

433
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,920
So, you're looking at financial statements

434
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,280
in the back office and what's happening,

435
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,400
but you also have to imagine

436
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:48,080
what's possible for the company

437
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,200
to achieve one day.

438
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,460
So, how do you balance the two?

439
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,480
And what are the ways that you are able

440
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,760
to then think about the big picture?

441
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,840
Yeah. So, obviously, you have to analyze

442
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,920
the size of your market,

443
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,480
your potential, your competition

444
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,240
what they could take.

445
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,200
So, a lot of "what if" scenarios

446
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,000
that you build in,

447
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,480
a lot of different projections

448
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,880
that you're trying to build and see,

449
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,240
Hey, what makes sense?

450
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,440
How big could it be,

451
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,600
and what makes sense

452
00:15:16,601 --> 00:15:19,320
to invest today to get there?

453
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,600
Right.

454
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,920
Versus maybe,

455
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:26,200
just milking the existing market.

456
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:26,840
But that's something

457
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,280
that's changing all the time, right?

458
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,600
I mean, looking at your market,

459
00:15:30,601 --> 00:15:31,760
looking at you competition.

460
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:34,240
On a strategic level,

461
00:15:34,241 --> 00:15:35,760
yeah, you have to do that

462
00:15:35,761 --> 00:15:37,680
every so often, right?

463
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,040
Typically on the strategic side,

464
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,320
things don't change every day, right?

465
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,200
But you definitely have to go

466
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,520
through this exercise

467
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,040
every so often to see

468
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,560
because different markets

469
00:15:49,561 --> 00:15:51,600
change at different pace, right

470
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,160
If you're in a very very fast

471
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,680
changing market,

472
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:56,280
then you have to do it much faster

473
00:15:56,281 --> 00:16:01,040
versus maybe established markets

474
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:04,080
with not many players, then maybe

475
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,480
you don't have to do that that often.

476
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,840
Yeah. Is it a very scary job

477
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:08,720
what you're doing?

478
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,600
I mean, managing,

479
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,280
'cause at the end, it sounds to me,

480
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,200
like you are the backbone of the company.

481
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,560
Always, the company

482
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,220
can look at you and say,

483
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,960
"Jacob, are we good? Are we good?"

484
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,560
"Yeah, we're good. We're good."

485
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,760
And you're the one

486
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,320
that's keen on all the numbers.

487
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,840
You know what's gonna happen in a month.

488
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,520
You're projecting

489
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,000
what's gonna happen in year.

490
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,560
It sounds like a lot of responsibility,

491
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,600
honestly.

492
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm still learning how to manage

493
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,600
my own finances properly.

494
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,360
You're managing billions of dollars.

495
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,360
So, is it scary sometimes?

496
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,400
No, it's not.

497
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,920
Obviously, I have to be

498
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,800
properly prepared for that.

499
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,440
Right.

500
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,360
And it all comes with experience.

501
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,400
Obviously, now, today,

502
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,640
I feel much more comfortable in my job

503
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:58,000
versus my first CFO job

504
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,680
when I got when I was 32, right?

505
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,720
That was a bit scary.

506
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,560
What was that like?

507
00:17:04,561 --> 00:17:05,830
What is it?

508
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,800
What was that like

509
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,800
getting your first CFO at 32

510
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,680
and for the first time

511
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,440
running the -

512
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,400
You have huge weight on your shoulders

513
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,720
and that kind of weighs on you, right?

514
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,480
And to make decisions

515
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,760
knowing that you are the last one

516
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,200
who makes decision

517
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,240
and the business will perform

518
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,400
based on your decision,

519
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,360
that's something that

520
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:29,550
you have to get used to.

521
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,560
How did that turn out at the end?

522
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,080
That was very successful.

523
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,360
You know that my first CFO job,

524
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,280
I joined a company

525
00:17:37,281 --> 00:17:39,040
that was going through

526
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,550
some sort of restructuring.

527
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,569
And, it was at the end

528
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,270
a very successful restructuring.

529
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,960
The company turned profitable.

530
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:52,960
And it was very good exercise

531
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,030
for me to understand,

532
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,110
to get my hands dirty in different things.

533
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:02,000
Incredible. So, you've seen growth

534
00:18:02,001 --> 00:18:05,320
at Mellanox from 50 million a year

535
00:18:05,321 --> 00:18:07,270
to a billion a year.

536
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,440
JFrog also,

537
00:18:08,441 --> 00:18:11,240
fast fast fast growing company.

538
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,680
Is that really where your excitement is

539
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,400
in the fast growing companies?

540
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,160
Oh, yeah, of course.

541
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,240
You want to come to the office

542
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:21,590
and deal with different things, right?

543
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,790
Every day.

544
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,480
And I'm not the person who's waiting to do

545
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,640
their routine stuff everyday.

546
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,220
So, the company that grow

547
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,480
and present those opportunities,

548
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,160
and that's what excites me.

549
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,960
So, if you have to give

550
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,080
some financial advice,

551
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,880
and obviously you're not supposed to give

552
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,960
financial advice informally,

553
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,680
but if you were to give financial advice

554
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,000
strategically to young entrepreneurs

555
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,440
that are starting their businesses,

556
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,080
or even entrepreneurs

557
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,880
who have now raised their series A

558
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
and are moving forward,

559
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,720
what are the most important things

560
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,830
that the CEO should keep in mind

561
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,510
given your knowledge of the CFO position?

562
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,640
Yeah. Always be frugal.

563
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,240
Frugal. Okay.

564
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,280
Don't throw away money

565
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,400
when you don't need to

566
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,480
because markets are volatile,

567
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,160
our economic environment is very unstable.

568
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,920
So, just cash is king.

569
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,790
I don't say don't invest,

570
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,750
but know where you invest.

571
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,840
What's your expectation

572
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,790
from that investment.

573
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,440
And just don't throw money.

574
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:25,880
Right.

575
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,840
I mean, when you deal

576
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,240
with these sums of money,

577
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:30,400
how granular does a company get?

578
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,520
I mean, when you're talking about

579
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,680
a $100 million deal,

580
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,720
I always thought to myself,

581
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,080
I remember I even asked a friend

582
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,720
when I was younger.

583
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,520
You buy a house for,

584
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,110
let's say, $500,000.

585
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,760
What if you could just ask,

586
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,520
like if you were to go to that dealer and say,

587
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,360
"Hey, can you give me a $500 discount

588
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,350
on the house?"

589
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,320
They would say, "Yes" right

590
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,160
Nobody would cancel the deal.

591
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:56,480
Yet, in our day to day lives,

592
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,720
we think a lot before we spend $500.

593
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,440
So, and in the same realm, I'm thinking

594
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,680
when you have a $100 million deal

595
00:20:04,681 --> 00:20:06,760
and you've seen those deals,

596
00:20:06,761 --> 00:20:08,880
how granular do people get

597
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,760
about the millions?

598
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,720
Or is it just

599
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,600
okay, let's just round it up

600
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,270
to the next nicest number

601
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,750
and make everybody happy?

602
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,790
I think at any deal,

603
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,200
it all depends on the materiality, right?

604
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,520
Okay.

605
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:26,040
Deal of $500, $100 is material

606
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,350
to that deal.

607
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,480
Right.

608
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,680
But in deal of $500 million dollars,

609
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,110
$100 is nothing, right?

610
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,800
So, really,

611
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:36,080
when you focus on material things

612
00:20:36,081 --> 00:20:39,040
and not just on pennies

613
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,840
that's what helps you

614
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,920
to think strategically.

615
00:20:40,921 --> 00:20:43,680
On the other hand,

616
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:45,640
my accounting department,

617
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,200
when they reconcile bank accounts,

618
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,000
they have to go to pennies, right?

619
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,310
And this is what I expect from them.

620
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,340
Sure. Okay no that make sense.

621
00:20:56,341 --> 00:20:58,270
It really depends on the role

622
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,160
and depends on the materiality of the deal.

623
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,200
I'm sure. I'm sure.

624
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,320
Jacob, before we leave,

625
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,920
I have to ask you

626
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:04,240
the most important question.

627
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,920
Three words that you would use

628
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,920
to describe yourself.

629
00:21:07,921 --> 00:21:11,350
Future.

630
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,160
Future.

631
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,590
Because future, I always think,

632
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,720
try to think, several years ahead.

633
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,750
That's something that guides me.

634
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,720
And that's why future, you know different people

635
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,000
live in different time, right

636
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,750
Some people live in present.

637
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,400
Yeah.

638
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,560
I'm always thinking about future.

639
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:33,110
Present is less concern me.

640
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,120
I always kind of think few steps ahead.

641
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,270
Amazing.

642
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,720
That's what it is.

643
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,760
I think the second would be fun

644
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:46,680
because we spend so much time at work.

645
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,880
And I'd like to do what I like to do

646
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,680
and to have fun with that, right

647
00:21:53,690 --> 00:22:00,240
And third, I don't know,

648
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,590
maybe different experiences.

649
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,590
Because other than work,

650
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,360
you have your life going on, right?

651
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,310
So you want to enjoy the life as well.

652
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,160
Work is very important component

653
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:13,960
of my life,

654
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,840
but I have various interest

655
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:18,070
other than work.

656
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,590
I love it.

657
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,360
I did not expect those three words

658
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,240
from a really really accomplished CFO.

659
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,070
I always love being surprised.

660
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,480
But, Jacob, thank you very much

661
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:28,960
for the time.

662
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,920
Thank you for your inspiration

663
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,790
and for teaching me.

664
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,280
We didn't even talk about J-Ventures

665
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,550
and early stage investing,

666
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,830
but we'll leave that for another time.

667
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,400
But thank you very much.

668
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,320
Thank you, Michael,

669
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,520
very much for having me.

670
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,830
Take care. Bye bye.

671
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,360
Bye bye.
